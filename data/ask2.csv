OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,When does it get better?,Month 4 and I still feel like this  is a waste of time.
genderfluidchick1989,asktransgender,Exploring taking a vacation as my potential preferred gender. Any one ever do this?,"As I think more of how to fully explore my space in the gender spectrum, it's become aware to me that I'd strongly prefer to have consecutive days of being a woman. I can't, realistically, do that where I live.

What I am, however, considering is a vacation a few hours from where I live, in another state, come warmer weather. Basically, spend at least a couple days living as ""woman me."" Wake up? Go out to eat? Go shopping? Go to the beach? All of this as woman me.

I feel like the only way I'll know for sure if I will actually prefer being a woman over being a man is to, well, not be a man for a few days. Do everything I can to be perceived as a woman, without seeming like a caricature of course, in an environment that is separated from my local community. Not that I live in a small town, just that the area I live in has a lot of small town like connections.

I still feel like I'll have my genderfluid side, but I've always thought I'd like to have the genderfluid cake from the side of being AFAB vs AMAB. Maybe if I spend a few days trying to be perceived as AFAB, even if I get perceived slightly masculine at times, I'll see if I do actually prefer that life over mine.

Overall, I don't feel like ""woman me"" is that far off from me right now, just that she is probably a bit more outgoing, a bit less reserved, and maybe less prone to staying in. ""Woman me"" likes most of the same stuff, only that she doesn't feel the need to qualify girly pop as ""guilty pleasure."" Like, I feel like having a few days to explore this side of me, see if what I think about ""woman me"" is true, see if I truly like being her more than me right now."

NekoMadeOfWaifus,asktransgender,How much can hormones affect my body?,"16 years old, wanting to be a girl, but won't be able to start hormone treatment before I'm 18, because I don't want to tell my parents. I'm extremely depressed by my body, especially my height, 185 cm (6'1"") and other aspects too, and I think about ending myself constantly and my body changing to much more masculine in the last month doesn't help either. How much would hormones be able to change how I look? Anything in height?"
genderfluidchick1989,asktransgender,Need advice on LGBT-friendly travel destinations.,"Okay, as mentioned in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5rhd61/exploring_taking_a_vacation_as_my_potential/) I am toying with the idea of a ""girl vacation"" where I spend as close to 0% of the time as possible as a guy. I also am wanting this, if possible, to be at least two full days (and three nights, counting the travel day down as one night, and travel day back up as not a night, if that makes sense).

Now, considering I live about halfway between Atlanta and the Georgia-Alabama line in the SE US, you can see where I am near. I want this trip to be somewhere with a beach. The closest three options I can see as ""getting there in a day without feeling like I have to travel the whole thing in one go"" are Charleston, SC, Tybee Island, GA, and Panama City Beach, FL.

Now, you might be wondering why I picked those three, they have beaches. I am not opposed to vacation spots without beaches that may be in similar (or even less) distance, like a Chattanooga, TN. Basically, anywhere less than about 4 hours from the metro Atlanta area, give or take a half-hour of travel difference. The big attraction beaches have to me, however, is that this trip is being formulated for a time in late spring/early summer.

The main reason I am so heavily focused on the beach spots, I already have a bikini that I think I look pretty good in, and would like to actually get some use out of it this year.

Now, a cheap hotel or airbnb spot with a pool would work as well, and if the trip to that spot was, say, an hour and a half to two hours away, instead of three and a half to four and a half hours, I'd probably like the idea a LOT better, it's just that I somehow imagine a major tourist spot like a beach being a bit more LGBT friendly, even in the south.

So, given less than four and a half hours driving straight from the Atlanta area, a reasonably modern feeling area, access to inexpensive lodging options (think really budget friendly), and reasonably friendly to LGBT types, particularly trans people who haven't started transitioning, where would you recommend?"
itsmecara,asktransgender,Anyone else have a problem with parents/family constantly staring at your chest?,"So it's the middle of winter and I've been wearing a ton of clothes to keep warm. However, when dealing with the parents all they can seem to do is stare at chest. There's not a whole lot there, only somewhat noticeable growth but since coming to terms with my transition, they seem to have lost where my eyes or face are located.

I joked with them a little today, ""Hey, eyes up here!"" but my humor is clearly too soon for them cause they were both acting like neither of them were looking and got snippy with me later over nothing. 

Anyone else with a similar problem of family looking for HRT changes?"
throwawaylask,asktransgender,"I have 3 questions about my preferred name and things I am unsure about. Androgynous name, when to use name, using different surname where is not from origination. Further explained below Also any other comments are welcome.","1. I want to change my name to possibly ""Riley"", but I just found out it is an androgynous name and therefore I am hesitant to use it because if I'm borderline passing in the future I want a name that would guarantee my gender to other people. Should I worry about this?

2. I don't really want to use my preferred name until I am passing and living as my preferred gender? Is that normal? 

3. The last name I want is a french name however I am not French should I choose this for my last name?

And your reason why?"
GirlygirlKristi,asktransgender,Bladder control options on Spiro?,"Just curious what all you girls do to control overactive bladder issues on Spiro? Does anyone use an OTC anti-diuretic like oxybutynin? Or have any suggestions? I haven't started any meds yet (meet with an endocrinologist for the first time this coming week), and I'm very nervous about this side effect. I already urinate very frequently, about 10-12 times in a 24 hour period, and I work a job where I can't always get to a bathroom right away. 

As of right now, the only thing I know I can do is cut out as much caffeine intake as possible, even though I already don't drink a lot... Maybe 2-3 cups of coffee (not including decaf that I drink in addition to caffeinated coffee) a few times a week and very little pop."
poopland92,asktransgender,What is the self harm rate for transgender people?,Considering that some studies show the attempted suicide rate being at 41%. I feel like a majority of transgender people have done some type of self harm.
GrammarRodeo,asktransgender,How to detransition?,"My life is much harder than it used to be. I'm depressed. Bordering on suicidal. Being transgender... existing in a non gendered state is too difficult to continue.  I rarely get gendered the way I want to be gendered and I feel like I've driven a wedge into all my existing friendships. All in all I feel like a garbage human being. And I've been physically assaulted and verbally harassed. 

So... how do I rewind and fix this? I had problems before. But I feel like my attempt to fix my problems with myself is only getting worse. I am 9 months into hrt now and I think I want to give up. 

How Do I Roll Back socially? My family coworkers and friends who stuck with me know I'm trans. Telling them I want to go back to my old name feels like a copout. And the physical changes... well losing the breasts. How do I do it? "
OzShepard,asktransgender,HRT changed me and I don't mind.,"So I've been on HRT for the past year and a half (MtF) and for me it's brought a pretty drastic change in my sexuality. Before HRT I was attracted exclusively to women. The thought of being with a man never even crossed my mind. No homophobia either , never had an issue with the idea it just wasn't for me. And now I have almost no attraction to women and am 100% attracted to men now. Just had my first experience with a man a couple of months ago and have a date with another tonight. So..yeah. Anyone else go through this change? I don't have a problem with it, I just find it interesting. Kind of funny to think, I was a straight ""male"", now I'm a straight woman. "
Sparklefists95,asktransgender,Can you get GRS without meeting the hrt timeline?,"So I've been really hoping to get GRS soon if I can, while most everything is still in my favor. Insurance should cover it, surgeon takes insurance, all that. However, on the requirements for coverage, my insurance lists being on hrt for at least 12 months (unless medically contraindicated, and on a case by case basis). However, I've had immense difficulty being on hrt consistently due to a severe needle phobia that prevents me from getting the blood work done on a regular schedule.

What I'm wondering is, does anyone know if I have any luck of getting approved without meeting that timeline? I'd wait if I could, but I'm afraid the window of opportunity might soon close, and I'm not sure I can handle the dysphoria for long enough either. I do meet all the other requirements, so this is the only potential issue. I tried asking my insurance about it, but they said the only way I could find out from them would be to actually start the whole process for authorization, and I'd really like to have a somewhat solid idea before getting that ball rolling just to be told no. "
WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,Moving along with Questioning but still a few problems.,"I've been posted here a few times now, but I've yet to find some epiphany or true answer to my inner questions. I've been questioning for just under three months.

I am no longer held up much by the fact that I wasn’t thinking about it when I was three but there WERE other signs not too much later with me being quite interested in transformation stuff, especially turning into a woman, but I am held up that because I haven't known since three or something that it will be hard to 100% convince anyone I come out to.

I am held up by the fact that I have slowly lost my social life. I am afraid someone will just bring up the point that this just might be me having severe social problems and if not that, I’ll be asked to gain somewhat of a social life before they let me do anything!

I feel as if it’s wrong to be feeling as of this… I might have gotten past most of my super super logical thinking which let me accept it a bit more, but I just feel that if my body is male, shouldn’t I just follow it through? The road of transitioning isn’t a 100% cure or nor does it offer a 100% success rate and this alone really tears me up… But I don’t particularly want to feel male, nor really be male, at all. Even at my most doubtful times, I don't really feel like ""Yay! I can stay a man!"" I just sorta feel angry that I would be doubtful.

I find myself really unable to admit to myself if whatever I am feeling is gender dysphoria or if I am just forcing myself to feel like such, though it really doesn't feel like the latter how would I know? I am also tore up by the fact that I don’t really know what to be feminine means/being a girl, yet I guess a good counter argument to that is I barely conform to anything particularly masculine, most things feel forced. Though with these two aspects I have a feeling if/when I start HRT, I imagine that's when a decent amount of dysphoria will come out. (not from me being cis but from me realizing I can actually change instead of just dreaming while looking at /r/transtimelines) But recently, I had looked at a year old asktransgender post, this one, [reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2wrz1n/anyone_else_loves_how_japanese_media_specially/) and though it is just a comic, the idea of a world where a COMPLETE sex change could happen had my eyes sweating profusely, tugging at my heartstrings.

But why should I bother? I go on my computer for hours and hours doing absolutely nothing with no social life… Why do something like transition if I am just going to sit around and do absolutely nothing? I've always known that I might one day find myself leaving the computer world due to some real life reason, or at least become much more flexible on how much I use it and I would never imagine myself being most likely transgender without a social life as being the pushing factor. (not saying I have to fully leave it! Because it's basically an addiction and coping method) 

I find it impossible to imagine myself coming out to anyone, cringing as I even think about it as I feel no matter how I saw it, I feel it wouldn't be sincere or genuine enough and with the small amount of time that I have been questioning, it would hold little to no validity but that only makes it scarier as I am worried that one of my three female parents (mother, aunt, grandmother) will confront me before I would want to say anything.

Though all that I have stated, I still want to talk to a specialized therapist, though I would absolutely be outraged if I got one of those gate-keeping ones. I don’t necessarily want to be shipped off into HRT land (or maybe I would) the second I walk in but I don’t want to be held back for years by reluctant or conflict of interest based therapists.

If you have any specific questions, just ask, I'd be glad to help you help me. I am well aware that I am basically somewhat repeating myself from my previous posts but questioning seems to know no bounds in criticizing myself."
hazelnut___,asktransgender,Do you find it harder to think about gender when tired?,"Before when I consider myself cis I never really thought about it but now when I get tired I realize that I lose touch with gender. I don’t act male or female, just tired. I find it hard to reflect on gender or mannerisms which in hand becomes a large source of gender dysphoria. I’m sure everyone experiences this but the heightened gender awareness trans people experience makes it more noticeable."
Awildbadusername,asktransgender,Groupon suspiciously cheap laser hair removal?,"So there is this laser place fairly near me that appears to be offering ""one year of unlimited laser hair removal"" for only around 200 bucks. This seems way too good to be true because lots of people around here seem to say that it will take around 8 sessions of laser to clear the most of male pattern facial hair so getting almost my entire face cleared seems to be amazing

Some of the fine print seems to check out but I am very suspicious of the price. I see lots of cute gals around these parts talking about the price and the time it takes to get laser done.

I can link the exact ad but only if you message me to try to keep my location secretive"
shinjirarehen,asktransgender,What to do about a TERF?,"**TL;DR: There a TERF in my wider social circle. Arguing with her seems pointless, but blocking her and putting myself in a bubble seems wrong, too. What do?**

I've been sitting with questions about this situation for a while, and I'm looking for some advice. 

I live in a pretty solid bubble of progessivism, both online and offline. I'm surrounded by feminists and social justice warriors (I will reclaim that term for good, TYVM), including many trans friends and allies. So it's not often I come up against someone who I deeply disagree with (obviously I should get out of my bubble more but that's another topic).

Except for this one super vocal TERF. Classic perl clutching, anti-trans, anti-sex worker bullshit. She's in my wider social circle (online and off) because she's also active in causes I support (anti-war, climate change, wealth inequality, etc). I find her views so repugnant (all the classic stuff about how trans women are really men trying to invade women's spaces and rape them, total denial of trans identity, blah blah blah), and she's a DIY 'journalist' that publishes a lot of content and does real damage, like putting funding for medical care of trans people at risk, accusing parents of trans kids of child abuse for supporting their transition, etc.

Some very brave and savvy local trans people and their allies mounted a counter-campaign after she took things too far. I supported them in spirit but I wasn't too involved because it all happened quickly and I wasn't particularly close to the people involved. I don't know the details but the TERF ended up losing her job and some of her platform for spewing her garbage. There was a petition but I didn't sign it (once it already hit its goal and was successful) because she was going to block everyone who signed and I thought maybe I can do more good if I can keep tabs on her.

Now, I mostly encounter this TERF on Facebook (and occasionally in person) and I just... don't know what my role is. I would love to just de-friend her and never think about it again, but I know I have so many privileges as a cis person, and it seems so wrong to leave the resistance to this TERF to trans people who already have to deal with so much other crap in our society. 

On the other hand, I really don't feel like arguing with her on the internet is going to do any good. It would sap my energy for the other impact work I'm trying to do (I'm an abuse survivor and disabled and just can't do it all), bring a flame war upon myself (from all her TERFy friends), and nothing I say will change her mind or actions. I have argued with her online before and it goes nowhere. I have some  cis-het white male feminist friends with more strength than me who put themselves in the firing line so others don't have to and that seems OK.

But it kills me to think that not speaking out against it every time could give some trans person reading it the impression that the silent majority agrees with her. If I ever witnessed actual abuse against a person I would 100% jump in immediately, but this is more about generalised BS she spews. And I feel like it's really bad for me to hide in this bubble and never be exposed to the reality of the messed up beliefs some people hold. I guess we all need to try and understand how these people think to effectively combat it?

So status quo for quite a while is I keep her on my friends list and look at what she posts, and I try to use it as an opportunity to educate myself and sharpen my own opposite beliefs. But I don't say or do anything, and it feels like a cop out.

I read something by an ex-TERF for who said:

&gt; Ignore [the TERFs] and fight hard for legal equality for transgender people, in terms of abuse, discrimination and violation of privacy.

And that's pretty much what I want to do. Is it the right approach? If I want to be an ally, should I de-friend her and save my energy for the fights that really matter, or jump more into the firing line so trans people don't have to as much (even though they are doing a pretty fucking good job taking care of themselves in this situation, much more effective than I know how to be). And above all, *this is not about me and my feelings because the impact on trans people is the main thing*... I just want to chose the path that can do the most good and I feel paralyzed.

Sorry this is long. Interested in your thoughts."
modifiedari,asktransgender,How do you deal with dating as trans?,"So I'm a trans guy who's had a hard time finding somebody mostly because I don't think anyone would be interested once I tell them I'm trans and I've been proven right about this on dating apps. I also can't picture myself having sex with someone ever since I transitioned. My bottom half makes me really dysphoric and since I'm bisexual, being with a girl would make me even more dysphoric.

Sometimes I wish I could just have sex in a cis body so bad that I wouldn't mind if I had been a cis female just so I wouldn't have to worry so much about enjoying it. I guess my main problem is I don't think anyone will ever sleep with me or want to be with me romantically because I'm trans and it just sucks. Dating hasn't been easy. Does anyone have any experiences or hopeful advice to dating in a world where even people within our LGBT community refuse to date us?"
broken-neurons,asktransgender,The fear of being alone for the rest of my life,"My wife and I separated a year ago after I came out as trans. Previously to that I'd been in several long term relationships with women. I now find myself single and I've created profiles on several dating sites such as OkCupid, Her and even Tinder in the attempt to meet someone. 

All my profiles are honest and state that I'm a transwoman and seeking a woman.

The response so far has been zero. I'm starting to get the feeling that the trans label is just putting people off completely, but I'd prefer to be upfront about it as it's part of who I am.

I had my first match on Tinder this evening. I asked the woman what they thought of my profile statement (that I'm trans), and the ""like"" was simply withdrawn, without so much as a ""sorry not for me"" reply. 

I'm starting to get the feeling that at my age I'm going to find it very difficult to find someone who wants to spend their life with me, and the realisation that I'm most probably going to spend the rest of my life alone is absolutely terrifying.

I'm even allergic to house pets so even a friendly dog for some company is out of the question.

Do others, especially older trans folk also share this terrifying fear of being alone for the rest of their lives?

I even flit with the idea of detransitioning just so I can join the cis world of dating and give up my inner peace just so I don't end up alone. Am I crazy?"
uromastyx1,asktransgender,How to tell therapist?,"I know this seems like a stupid question, but I honestly feel uncomfortable telling my therapist that I'm trans. Obviously I need a therapist before I can get hormones, etc. However, she isn't a gender therapist, only a general one, so I'm not sure how she feels about trans people. Should I just go ahead and tell her?"
fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,"I like to look very feminine, but I have a very masculine personality","If I were to transition (mtf) , I would present very feminine in the way to present. I'd love to wear dresses, high heels, makeup, etc. 



But the trouble is that the way I have a masculine personality,  and I dislike acting feminine if that makes sense. Like, I've tried to act more feminine, speak more feminine (I am still living as male). 



If I were to present female, even if I'd look passable, the way I speak, act and behave will be very obvious they I'm AMAB, and will be a dead giveaway. I can't change it, its just the way I am. It's like trying to act like someone else, it just doesn't feel right.

ViceAdmiralThrowaway,asktransgender,Please help with my young son.,"Edit: It's late here and I'm heading to bed. Thanks to everyone who has replied already, I'll read and respond to everyone in the morning.

Hi all,

Please excuse what is bound to be a rambling, stream-of-consciousness style post. I'll try my best to keep it coherant.

My oldest son is 6.5 years old. Ever since he was about two, two and a halfish, my wife and I have openly talked to each other about how ""quirky"" he was. He loved things that other boys his age didn't seem to. He was drawn to toys and activities you could typically associate as ""girls things"" in a gendered society. He loved dress-ups, and dolls, and playing animal doctors with his toys, and didn't really enjoy the more physical activity or play that the boys his age did. His friends were primarily girls, and he loved tea parties and playing Mums and Dads.

This has continued as he's grown older. He loves Shopkins and brightly coloured soft toys, continues to love dolls, and dress-ups. His friends are still mainly girls, and he isn't at all enthusiastic about playing ""boys games"".

Over the last twelve months or so, he's talked about growing his hair long so he looks like a girl. He asked my wife and I if we could buy him some dresses. We did, and he proudly wore one home from the shopping centre, and out for dinner, and he loved it. When looking for the right kind of dress, he seemed a bit frustrated until he found some black and white striped ones, and exclaimed ""Aha! This is where the boys dresses are!"".

In recent weeks he's said that once his hair gets passed his ears, our ""small family"" (my wife and I, and his younger brother) should start calling him Jane, but to call him his real name when around friends or other family, ""so it doesn't make people sad.""

At this point, I'm not quite sure what to do. My wife would be happy for him to be a boy, or a girl, or to call him his real name or a new name, or whatever is going to make him happy and comfortable - and I would defend him against anyone who would challenge that - but I have this weird thought in the back of my head, wondering if it's just a phase? (Sorry for the patronising kind of phrasing there)

I don't know how much to explain to him about transgendered people, or the concept at all. I don't know if it's the right thing to do at this point or not. I don't want to overwhelm or potentially scare a young kid who is possibly just trying to find him(her?)self.

My wife and I are very much taking a ""you be you, and you'll be loved no matter what"" kind of approach, but I'd dearly love to hear some input from people who've been through this sort of thing firsthand, or from families of people who have.

At the end of the day, I just want my kid to be happy and confident, and I don't want his life to be harder than it has to be. He's a wonderful kid, and I want to make sure that we're doing the best we can for him."
fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,"I used to be a straight cis guy, but within the past year I've turned into a Bi trans woman","So when I started puberty (10-11ish) and you asked me, I would of said I was a straight cis guy (well, I wouldn't of known what trans or cis meant, but you know).




I was like any other boy growing up. There was nothing feminine I did. I did enjoy dressing up as a girl by my sister (I used to pretend I hated it). Although that was it.


When I was 12/13, I was like any other boy that age. I played video games all day, I liked girls, I had crushes on girls. I have never actually done anything with anyone before, I was too anxious to and plus I wasn't attractive enough anyway. I was a cis guy that just happened to crossdress in private as a fetish.


It was like that until I was 16, and everything started turning around. 




When I just turned 16, I started liking guys too, although I preferred girls more. I was still crossdressing at this time. I realized I would of rather been born a girl, but that was purely because I could wear female clothing out in public and it would be completely normal. 


Then 7 months later, I fell out with my group of friends. This was during the summer, so I spent practically a month in my room on my own. Back when I was 9 and 12 I remember thinking that something was wrong with me, and they came back. I 


These feelings continued for 10 months, then it all changed here. I knew what transgender was, but I didn't really know what it was. I discovered the true meaning of being trans, and gender dysphoria. Then I started getting dysphoric thoughts that I never really had before. I then started feeling I'd rather be born a girl, I've been having suicidal thoughts, but I only get it when I am alone.  It feels weird being male now, however I think I am forcing myself a little to think that way.



I get suicidal about being AMAB and not being able to transition, but when I am out of the house I completely forget about it? When I am alone I cant bare being male but when I am with others I am completely fine with being male. 



I've now been like this for 4 months. I'm starting to think that it will be alright in a couple of months, I'm forcing myself to transition when I don't really need to. Or that I am not fine at all and it is going to get worse with time.




Not sure what to do. I'm hoping to get on the waiting list for a GIC, however the waiting lists are so long anyway, and I can't afford to go private.

TheRealTearDrops,asktransgender,Dr Rossi ???,"With the need to keep warning about the disastrous outcome of my surgery with Dr Rossi and T.Change, here again is a link to see my CT scan. The scan was taken about a week after my second surgery with Dr Ross, in October 2015. It shows the mess that he had previously made of my forehead surgery, which was done in September 2014, and the utter destruction of my chin in the October 2015 surgery. If you look closely at the scan you can see that the chin Mental nerve housings have been cut right through. The nerves have been completely severed through, and I have no feeling in my bottom lip and whole chin whatsoever as a consequence of this barbaric action by Dr Rossi. The chin has now 'Fallen', so it is hanging down beneath were it used to be on my face. It looks terrible, and I'm unsure if it will ever be able to be corrected. http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a484/chrisgeorgev/3D%20Scan1%202_zps5yquse1t.jpg

SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,So.. typically how long does it take to completely nuke the unwanted hormone?,"So to start with, for the most part I feel.. good aside from my insane dysphoria that makes me want to crawl in a hole and die because of the radiating feeling from the unwanted attachment inbetween my legs. Enough of that though.

At 8/10/2016 here were my levels.
Testosterone: 478 ng/dL
Estradiol: 36 pg/mL

At 11/3/2016 here were my levels..
Testosterone: 266 ng/dL
Estradiol: 105 pg/mL

And lastly... 2/7/17
Testosterone: 201 ng/dL

Is the price is too good to be true? Is IPL useful for medium density hair on my thighs? Should I just try for fun? 1 year IPL = 1 month 1 session?..

I got 0 idea on hair removal... as I even rarely shave my beard (shave once every month prior to HRT) using normal electric shave... So i did not do any hair removal of other parts before... I'm just starting to get annoyed by my legs hair keep caught by my pants and jeans.. 

If this method (IPL) is not quite effective... Does the price sound dirt cheap enough for getting my first experience? Advice needed &gt;&lt;"""
queersparrow,asktransgender,Can y'all help me understand something about dysphoria? (NSFW text),"Gonna just say here at the start that this involves questions about social dysphoria and non-dysphoric transness, so if this isn't something you're super comfortable/interested in talking about with a confused person, please just stop reading here. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, I'm just hoping there are a few people around here who enjoy existential questions and might be comfortable helping me work through some long-standing confusion.

Also, I'm interested in any and all perspectives, regardless of current gender or sex at birth.

With that out of the way, a bit of (longer than expected) backstory to hopefully help people understand where I'm coming from... I'm 25, queer, neurodivergent, afab, fairly (lean, white) androgynous. I've been experiencing physical dysphoria since I hit puberty. I was livid the first day I got my period, and spent a brief time convinced that it would go away if I hoped hard enough. I was angry when my breasts began to develop (and eventually a disconcerting mixture of physically relieved and socially embarrassed when they never amounted to much). As my sexuality began to develop, it was hit or miss whether my mental picture of myself had a penis (more common) or a vagina. I've always considered it a great universal injustice that I can't pee standing up (I'm really not sure this qualifies as dysphoria for me, since it really does just feel like a cruel joke). In a sexual context, I'm more likely to empathize with a penis-having participant than a vagina-having participant. Strap-ons piss me off because they don't convey sensation the way I'm meant to feel, and I hate settling. For all that, I honestly don't harbor any particular animosity for my vagina, it just isn't what's supposed to be there. It took me until well into my 20s to discover that other people experience the feelings I was experiencing, and that there are things one can do about it. (I haven't done anything, which is a whole other story.)

On the other hand... I don't really experience social dysphoria. I've always defied social gender norms, and taken pride in being a woman who does so. When I had my hair cut short as a child, it wasn't because I wanted ""a boy's haircut,"" it was because I wanted short hair, thought it was ridiculous that short hair be reserved for boys, and took a perverse pleasure in other people being discomfited by my choice. When I demanded clothes from the ""boys"" section of the store it wasn't because I wanted ""boys"" clothes, it was because those clothes were comfier and more rugged and I enjoyed wearing them (I've never been able to stand tight clothes, or dresses, largely for sensory reasons). Straight through to present day my interests tend to lead me to places where I'm surrounded by guys, but I've always considered the skew in gender representation to be the result of social pressures rather than any inherent gendering of those subjects. I've never felt like social gendering has any bearing on who I am as a person, even when the associated expectations of others piss me off (to me, that's always been a feminist issue; a reflection on society, not on my gender). Besides which, I'm sentimentally attached to my name and I honestly don't care what pronouns people use for me, or whether I get ""sir"" or ""ma'am."" (Thought I really do hate it when people pick one and then second-guess themselves and get embarrassed and things get awkward, or when someone who knows me ""corrects"" someone who doesn't know me and we get to share the awkwardness aaallll around. -.- )

All this sort of brings me to where I'm at now, which is an ongoing place of confusion. My introduction to the trans community at large was via someone who was experiencing social dysphoria but not physical dysphoria, so my first serious introduction to the concept of being trans was surrounded by people who experience dysphoria (or don't) in ways that are practically opposite from my own experiences. Possibly it's my neurodivergence speaking, but years later, I still don't really comprehend social dysphoria that isn't associated with physical dysphoria, or what it means to be a non-dysphoric trans person. I understand, in terms of identity, that dysphoria is not a necessary component of transness, but I don't emotionally *get* where that feeling of gender-wrongness comes from in people who are happy with the body they were born in.  That's what I'm trying to understand here.

So... Where *does* that feeling come from? What is it like? What does it mean to feel ""like a man"" or ""like a woman,"" or to like ""boys' things"" or ""girls' things?"" Are there things in life that are inherently masculine or feminine - clothing, interests, mannerisms? So often when people describe what makes them feel trans, it's couched in traditionally gendered language; is there something to this, or is it a social convenience? What is the bridge between the rejection of social gender norms as antiquated and adherence to those norms as indicators of our own gender? 

.

I just have so many questions, heh. I feel like this has been a lot more than I meant to put down all at once, but it's been taking up space in my head for such a long time, so I hope it's okay. This is my first foray into something other than lurking on reddit, so if there's anything I need to change or anything, please let me know.

hazelnut___,asktransgender,"Did you ""feel"" more female after starting HRT?","Ok, before you jump on me for the unbelievably stupid question let me explain. 

In most situations I feel male, as in the amount of space my body takes up, the way my clothes hang off of me, the broadness of my shoulders. When I imagine myself taking HRT and eventually presenting female I get kind of uneasy at the idea of trying to pass while spatially feeling male.

I'm sure things like less muscle and shifting body weight helps and that to an extent this feeling is a mindset kind of thing but I'd love to hear your experience. "
starryhyles21,asktransgender,Question(s) for Transgender Gym-Rats,"I've been approved for HRT and will likely start March 1st, but have some random questions that have been weighing on my mind.

I'm 25 MtF (Pre-HRT still), and an avid bodybuilder. I've lifted weights since high school, and am currently in great shape-- have a six pack, pretty ripped arms, etc. (sorry for the humblebrag). However, this doesn't alleviate my dysphoria by any means.

So I guess my question is, is there anyone out there who was an avid gym-goer that was 'muscular' before HRT, and if so, how HRT affect your workouts? My shoulders are pretty broad, particularly due to lifting, but my biceps/triceps and forearms are definitely pretty bulky and masculine. 

Additionally, what was it like to lose/alter your muscle(s) you had before HRT? Lifting is a passion of mine, and im nervous for the 'in-between phase' so-to-speak. 

Last question (I'm add'ing so hard rn, sorry!), but did anyone else have big pectoral muscles before starting? Is there any correlation behind having muscular pecs and breast development?

I've heard about massaging them regularly and taking supplements and other things to help increase breast size, but I was curious what others do that they feel actually helps and it isn't just some blog BS. Do you have a set routine for massages? Just let them exist? Take a certain amount of whatever? Voodoo?

I feel like I could probably live as male fine in the future, but another part of me says it won't be. 


Do I go on HRT for a couple of years, go out as female one day and then discover that I don't actually like it? I'm worried about not wanting it in the future more than anything. It's like I'm pushing myself to be something that I might not be.

[deleted],asktransgender,Stuck in pre-transition - any advice?,"Hi, I'm April. I lurk a lot here and draw so much strength and inspiration from this sub. Today I'm posting a thread... I could use some advice or encouragement. Any thoughts are appreciated.

I'm certain that I'm transgendered. I spent the last couple years in and out of dysphoria and denial but it's become very clear to me that I'm a woman.

Even so, I feel incredibly stuck. I'm not sure how to even begin acting on this knowledge. Figuring out practical next steps is one thing, but I'm so overwhelmed by the amount of change this will bring into my life.

My family is fairly understanding for a traditional Asian immigrant family in the US. But many of them will have a hard time accepting this. I'm close with my family. My father will more than likely cut off contact with me, and the thought of that is unbearable. My mother, who is very accepting and tolerant generally, does not understand trans issues and becomes visibly uncomfortable whenever I have talked about gender expression or my trans friends.

Then there's work. How can I suddenly change my relationships to all of these people I've worked with for years? I want to go to law school next year, how will that be affected? And what about the political climate? This is such a scary time. Shouldn't I lay low until things are less insane?

I'm the type of person who gets by being unnoticed, drawing little attention to herself. I've always wanted to have a very quiet life. I want to go on hormones, but I actually don't care very much if I'm publicly ""out"". And I'm terrified of being out in public as myself, anyway. I'm a big person and there's no way I wouldn't draw attention. How can I achieve my goal without completely upending my life?"

Is it worth it? Will I regret it? Am I just super confused cis guy? What if I want to de-transition, how stupid will I look?  



I'm not entirely sure about everything. I don't even know if I'd rather be born male or female at this point. 2 months ago I would of said female, but now I'm not too sure. 


Some might argue that it's best to do something about it now (I'm 17) but I still don't know tbh. I'm getting a referral to a GIC, but it's probably around April 2018 until I can see one. 



But some might also argue that if living as male isn't bothering me that much (and only when I'm alone at night) then is it worth living as female when I'm not dysphoric. 


I don't like change though. Maybe if my gender ain't broke then don't fix it? Something like that?

hayley90,asktransgender,[Update]MtF voice surgery - An alternative to Yeson (particularly for those in Europe). I had glottoplasty with Prof Marc Remacle in Luxembourg two weeks ago. This is my outcome...,"Link to original post

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5snsn8/mtf_voice_surgery_an_alternative_to_yeson/

-----------------------------------------------------------------

So I am now about six weeks post op, from my vocal feminisation surgery with Prof Marc Remacle in Luxembourg.

When I did a recording three weeks ago my voice was very high (~295hz) and has since settled into a more natural range.

Here is a recording of my voice from today:

http://vocaroo.com/i/s0IwOR2ca4zT

This recording gives an average of ~240hz.

I also did a recording trying to go as low as I could and this is the outcome:

http://vocaroo.com/i/s1o4vv8geYsp

This recording gives an average of ~205hz.

I am so pleased with the outcome of the surgery.

So far, I've been able to go to the nail salon and get my nails done.  I was really put off going before surgery as I passed apart from my voice and I didn't want everyone in the salon staring at me.  I went this past Saturday and had a really nice time.

At the place I'm getting laser hair removal on my legs, I had a new lady doing it and she asked me if I was on any medication or if there was a chance I could be pregnant.  She had no idea I was trans.

And today I went for a physiotherapy appointment (nothing trans related).  On their form I had to list which medication I was on and I put down that I was on E and the physiotherapist looked a bit confused and asked why I was on that.

So my voice has given me the freedom to get on with my life now and hopefully gain more self confidence.

I've only talked to one person on the phone so far and that was the IT guy at work who knew me in my past life, so I haven't been able to put it to the test on the phone yet, but from being previously misgendered on the phone it has left me with a bit of anxiety with making phone calls now.  Just something I'll have to overcome I guess.

My voice is still a bit raspy and gets worn out towards the end of the day, but it is still only six weeks post op and compared to my last recording three weeks ago sounds a lot better.

If you're considering VFS then I highly recommend contacting Prof Remacle.

He gives you his private email address and you can email him any concerns or questions and he replies really quickly.  I've emailed him before I went to sleep before and I woke up the next day to see he replied at like 2am!

If anyone wants to AMA about the procedure, feel free."

chasingmars,asktransgender,"Borderline parents, emotional incest, and gender identity","Ever since I can remember as a child I had always wanted to be a girl.  Throughout my childhood, my gender and sexual identity was very confusing to me.  It was especially hard in high school when I kept wavering back and forth between thinking I should be a girl and thinking I am just a gay man.  In college, I started to repress all of these feelings and had spent my 20s living as a straight male (getting married to a woman, forcing myself to get into a lot of male hobbies, etc).

Six months ago, at 29, I started therapy to deal with my BPD (borderline personality disorder) mother.  When I started therapy, I didn't think much of my gender and sexual issues, thinking the anxiety and depression I've had was related to the mind games from my mom.  Over time, things started to unravel and I began exploring my gender identity and who I really am.

During my time in therapy, a lot of memories from my childhood have surfaced (I barely had any memories pre-high school before going to therapy).  A lot of this revolves around abuse that is common in BPD parents: parentification and emotional (covert) incest as well as possible other sexual abuse (I don't have any actual memories of sexual abuse but I have always had a feeling I was abused and can check off every symptom common for sexually abused children to have).

&gt; Emotional incest from either parent is devastating to the child's ability to be able to set boundaries and take care of getting their own needs met when they become an adult. This type of abuse, when inflicted by the opposite sex parent, can have a devastating effect on the adult/child's relationship with his/her own sexuality and gender, and their ability to have successful intimate relationships as an adult.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_incest)

I haven't really come across too many threads related to gender identity issues caused (or potentially caused) by parents with Cluster B personality disorders.  It makes me very confused and somewhat invalided given that most of what I read about gender identity is usually caused during pregnancy (""born this way"") vs traumatic, abusive upbringings that could cause these identity issues to arise.

I definitely feel a lot happier dressing up and I really want to transition but reading things like this make me feel like maybe I'm not ""truly"" trans.

Does anyone have any similar experiences to this?"

I currently pretty much identify as male and don't have much of a desire, if at all, to be female. You might ask why have I been questioning then. I seem to have tons of experiences in common w/ other MTFs and a lot of typical hallmarks of ""AGP"" late onset MTFs. This includes having these experiences begin at the onset of puberty. This includes only having sexual fantasies as female. Along with praying every night for years to wake up a girl and in general having a strong desire to be one. I eventually gave up on that due to being ignorant of HRT and feeling it was impossible. I even identified as a male that wanted to be a lesbian at the time. Now however I don't seem to have that same desire, if so it's pretty subtle and I don't hate my body. I feel I could move on, if it weren't for feeling that I can't be CIS do to all of this and more. Also I recently read an article explaining how ""late onset"" MTFs often later in life have a ""trans awakening"" and begin identifying as female.

shiprekk42,asktransgender,My fucked up love story,"Once upon a time, I did something super fucked up. 
I lied to a girl.
Backstory: I met this girl my sophomore year in high school. Instantly fell in love, and remain so to this day. Before I thought I was bisexual, long before I even knew I’m trans. I asked her to be my girl not quite a year ago, and in the time we were together ifeel even deeper in love. Within three months I would have married her, if she'd have had me. As a male I've been with several women... but of ask of them, not a single one did I love as much as I did, and do, this one. But I still didn’t come clean about something very personal to me. A deal breaker, in her mind. So when I finally did tell her, about three months after we had started dating, she left me. 

Now, about 6 months after being left by the woman I’d gladly remain male for, I legit can’t get past wondering what would be if she and I were together still. Where we’d be as a couple, if we’d be something more or something less. If “I love you” would be a frequent phrase, or a more magical, infrequent treat as it was before I came clean with her. If sexuality intimacy would be the same treat “I love you” was, or a life necessity. 

This woman holds my heart, and likely will until my days end on this earth and I transgress to my next plane of existence.
But I can’t help to wonder if she’ll hold this power over me all my life, or if somehow I can find some measly kind of closure and healing in my pergatory-esque state of being as it is at the current moment. 

I just… idk what to do, what to feel… what to even think, not only of myself and how I handled things, but of what could be/could have been. 

She was justified, I feel, in her decision… in fact, had roles been reversed, I would very likely have taken the same path she took. But despite that, I can’t help but feel that it was an issue that could have at least been talked through, and eventually forgiven... am I massively wrong, and poorly fixated on a lost love I'll never experience such magic with again? Or am I right, and unjustly suffering some bullshit based on an overreaction?

Please… help. I hurt, deeply. And I’ve no clue how to fix it. 
Someone please help me.

MissTinaLuv,asktransgender,Questions about medically transitioning with liver disease or hepatitis,"Hello, pre-transitioner here. I not too long ago did something very stupid and now think I may have acquired Hep C (thankfully I'm vaccinated against B), but I'll have to wait a month or two longer to test in order to find out due to the damn window period.

I'm worried that this will make the medical side of transition impossible for me. From what I've heard the antiandrogens and estrogen take a toll on your liver, so I'm worried that they will be out of the question if the virus and potentially the meds are also damaging the liver. Also I feel like surgeons for FFS, BA etc. won't even look at me if I have a blood born pathogen :(

Has anyone here had any experience or know someone who has had of transitioning with viral hepatitis or another liver disease?"

morallyflexi,asktransgender,"Sex and love questions, from someone trying to be a better partner","I suppose let me start by saying I'm a cis woman, and my girlfriend is trans. We're both in our mid 20's. We've been dating for about 5 months, and I'm in love with her. Honestly, everything about her; she's brilliant, fun, beautiful, sexy. I love being with her, she's my favorite person.

I have a few questions, and I'm not sure how best to phrase them. 

1. How do I give my girlfriend screaming orgasms? 

She hates and feels disconnected from her penis, and expresses a general disassociation from her body / lack of ownership of her body. She's attempted suicide in the past, and she says the disassociation is a coping mechanism that helps her. But we're having issues working through her lack of feeling during sex. We both want her to feel good and get off, but I can rarely get her over the edge into the quivering gibberish zone where I seem to live whenever she touches me anywhere. 

We avoid her genitals because of her dysphoria, and I usually massage her and focus on the kinds of sensation play I know she likes. We've tried candle wax and bondage, and some minor penetration, which she's enjoyed but would prefer to go slow with, but I still haven't been able to make her  experience anything close to what she's been able to do for me, which frustrates us both. I really want to do more for her.

Also, she has a very high sex drive, but can't masturbate, and she's expressed frustration about how limited her options for pleasure are. 

Does anyone have any experience with this who could offer me some advice?

2. Since meeting my girlfriend, I think I have a romantic preference for trans women? 

We're polyamorous, and I have a profile on a dating site. I've noticed that in the last few months, when I notice a girl and click on her profile, almost a majority of the time she turns out to be trans. I don't know if it's a preference I've always had and never noticed, or if it's new. But either way I haven't been sending these girls messages because I don't want to be a chaser or a fetishist, and I never want my girlfriend to see me as someone who's only interested in her for the body she hates. 

At the same time, I feel like I'm not getting to know cute people I'd really hit it off with because of this worry. What do y'all think?"

SlepGudOistr,asktransgender,I want to give up. How do I keep going?,"I hate being male. I hate being masculine. I hate living as an average joe. I *hate hate hate* it. But... it seems easier. It's the path of least resistance.

Living. Being *alive* is hard enough for me. Everything I do is draining. Mentally, I'm in a fog. I lock my feelings and truths in a box in my head. It's so *hard* to deal with what the world requires of me... I can't imagine working, going to school, making friends, going the store, talking to people etc... I can't imagine doing all of that *on top* of transitioning into a trans-woman. I'm not afraid to admit I'll barely pass as a woman, if even at all. 

Regardless, it will be very difficult and draining on it's own. On top of daily life, I don't think I can do it. I *want* to do it. But I'm not strong enough. If I'm too weak to handle living like I am, how *can* I do it?

God, what I'd give to just snap my fingers and be over with it... Living the hard lie that I am, with just a little effort, I can do anything. I could be an engineer, an architect, scientist, police officer, politician. You name it, I could potentially do it. But, I don't want to do that. 

I'll burden myself by building an image of myself that isn't who I *truly* am. And I'm afraid to move anywhere in my life because the more steps I take in that direction, the further I move from transitioning. The further I move from being at peace with myself. And that in itself is hard.

So, living like a drone working a shitty retail job, striving for nothing... Being nothing... It's gotta be easier. I can't physically OR mentally handle anything else. 

**TL;DR: Live as a lifeless drone; easy way to live. Strive for greater things/transition; hard and draining.**

I'm currently enrolled in a city leadership program along with another 3 high school seniors and about 15 adult members of our community.

The other 3 high school seniors are all girls, so no chance of being put with them. I ended up getting roomed with an adult participant. He doesn't seem like a bad guy, he's really involved in our community and good organizations and everything. But, something about sharing a room with a grown man makes me somewhat uneasy. I'll be 18 in April (barely a minor at this point) and supposedly a guy, so maybe the city doesn't see anything wrong with this development, but I identify as a girl (trans, pre-everything and way in the closet). Should I do anything about this? I've considered booking a separate cheap room in another hotel, skipping out on the trip altogether, or talking with the lady in charge and seeing if I could negotiate for the single room that as of now will be occupied by a guy who offered to drive himself to the capitol (it's a long drive and he wouldn't have fit in the van, so he's doing everyone a favor). Most realistically, though, I'll probably have to just suck it up and comply. It's not like anything will happen, it's just me being paranoid and anxious over something trivial.

kastmegihavet,asktransgender,Am I a transwoman and not a gay man?,"Hi, 

I'm a 35 yrs old MAAB trans-something, wondering whether I should transition or not. And I would really like to hear your opinion. please! 

I am currently living in a gay relationship, and have been out as gay for more than 10 years, but I never really felt it suited me perfectly. But even though I contemplated being transsexual in my teens, I thought it was too much to handle and sort of pushed the feelings aside and focused on who I was attracted to. 

Through the years I secretly crossdressed and fantasised about being female, but felt tremendous shame and tried to quit many many times. Fast-forward to me turning 30 and I stopped feeling so shameful about it and accepted that it would be part of me for the rest of my life. And I started seriously investigating transgender / transsexual feelings, symptoms, thought experiments etc. And I started accepting I was some sort of transgender person, most likely transsexual. 

But since my feelings seemed to come in waves, sometimes feeling very strongly about me being female, and later not really care, I did nothing. I only talked once to my gp about it, but he was no real help, I just felt stupid mentioning it.

For the 5 last years I have only felt stronger and stronger that I should be female. And more often than before. So I am seriously considering to transition now, but I feel for some reason someone un-partial should say to me: ""yes, you sound transsexual and I think you will benefit from HRT and GRS!"". 

So here are my reasons why I think I am transsexual: 
- Whenever I see my self naked in the mirror I wish I could see a woman in the reflection.
- I don't like my penis, but would really, really love to have a vagina. I think about it every day! 
- I feel my chest is very flat and think I would enjoy having breasts
- I would like to have a bigger butt
- I hate all my body hair, and would like to be able to shave my legs without anyone commenting on it
- I am a straight woman in all of my sexual fantasies, mainly fantasising about normal intercourse
- I am experimenting with small doses of estrogen and spiro, and I like the effects. I smile and enjoy seeing my nipples/breasts grow, my butt grow and my lips getting fuller. (The only reasons why I have stopped are external reasons, like boyfriend, work, family...)
- I would like to be able to wear female clothing's without anyone harassing me.
- I smile thinking about living a regular life as a woman
- I smile thinking about transitioning
- If I had a button in front of me that would make me into a woman, I would press it instantly
- If I was alone on an island with hormones and a surgery machine, I would transition to a woman

Reasons why I am not a woman: 
- I enjoy standing up to pee
- I enjoy my strength
- I can't visualise me as an old woman (or a man for that matter)
- ?!?

So I know I am not regular man, and I know I should probably go to counselling. But I would like to hear your opinion first...

Do I sound like a transwomen? And if so, what are your advice for me? Counselling, coming out, HRT, surgery??
And what are your experience with other transwomen, should most of us transition in order to become happy?

Thanks a lot for reading my message! &lt;3

namethrowawayh,asktransgender,Is changing names more than once an okay thing to do?,"Hi guys,  I'm an FtM high school student, I'm out at school and have my preferred name on the roll.

I have a full name picked out that I'd rather go by, but I'm not sure whether this is okay... maybe not at school, but I feel bad about my friends and stuff.

milkweedmao,asktransgender,How can I convince her that my reaction to her pics is sincere?,"So, I (21 y.o.) met this one girl (17 y.o.) in a transgender chat last summer. Since then we've been communicating more and more online via social media. We live in different cities and have never met irl.

I really like her - her personality and appearance. I think I fell in love with her. So did she. To be honest, she was the first to tell me how much she liked me, but since our communication had originally been not very serious, I thought she was just joking. 

But after some time, I realised that she was sincere. I was happy when we finally changed the nature of our communication from half-joking to something more serious. In fact, I wanted this change for a long time, but thought that she only saw me as an online dude to joke around with when she felt bored. 

Here's the problem. I understand that she has insecurities about her appearance, she told me about that a lot of times. I told her (a bunch of times, in details) that I really like the way she is and that it's not her appearance that matters to me (she has asked me a few times if I ""could date a male, because [she] looks like one""). However, I feel like she doesn't believe me. At all. Every time she says the same damn things: ""the filters make me look feminine"", ""I'm afraid that you will not be interested in me when you see me in person"", etc. 

A few weeks ago, she was very angry with me, thinking that I was making fun of her when I said that I liked the pics she had sent me. We had a huge fight the following day. She was very close to end our communication that day. But I managed to make her change her decision. Since that everything has been going kind of smooth, I would say. Until this evening. 

She sent me a few pics of her. She captioned the first one with ""i look like a male"", but the way she wrote it looked half-joking. The second one was captioned with ""I'm so ugly in the mirror"". I didn't think that, so I let her know - ""you look good, I really like these pics"". She replied with ""don't lie, i'm ugly and look like a male"". So I told ""I don't see it, you can tell whatever you want about my taste, but I do find these pics very pleasant"". After that, she was replying to my messages briefly or even ignored some of the questions. I asked what was the deal and she said ""nothing, I'm sorry, I am in no mood"". A couple more messages and she deleted her profile. 

To tell the truth, I am not sure it's because of the pics and all the reaction around them, maybe she has quarrelled with her mom again. But since we send pics (all types of them) to each other a lot on on a daily basis, and she does send me this type of pics where she finds herself looking like a male or just ugly, how should I react to them?! 

a. when I say good things (and I do it sincerely, because I actually find her very attractive), she doesn't believe me;
b. I feel like ignoring them will make her think I don't like her ""this way"" or even agree with her;
c. I cannot say bad things, nor I feel the need to, but if I did, I'm 100% sure she would get upset (she has already told me that since I'm the guy she likes, she's very sensitive to my words).

**TL;DR**: Girl, who I've been communicating online with for half a year now, doesn't believe my reaction to some of her pics is sincere. She sees herself ugly and masculine. When I disagree with her, she accuses me of lying or ""trolling"". I'm worried that this can affect our relation for the worst. 

If everything's fine, I will go to her city next week and we'll finally meet. I really hope this changes her perception of me, but anyway, maybe there's a way, which I've never thought of, to convince her of my sincere and good intentions? Or is it simply her self-doubt I can do nothing about? I'm just tired of feeling guilty of something weekly.

transidk,asktransgender,"My body keeps masculinizing, is there any way to make it stop without HRT?","Hi, this is my first post on Reddit so sorry in advance if I do something wrong, I'm still not entirely sure how this site works lol.

Anyway, some background info: I'm a 19 year old closeted trans girl and have Crohn's Disease (a gastrointestinal autoimmune disease.) I've had it since I was 14, one of the things Crohn's Disease does to some people is it slows down/delays puberty. It slowed down puberty a lot for me, the only things parts of puberty that really effected me were that I got taller or things that happened to me before I had Crohn's (like leg hair growth or my voice getting deeper) continued.

So anyway, my body didn't really masculinze that much for the past few years. I'm really happy about that, because as difficult as my disease was to manage, it at least helped me out with the whole trans thing. However, after years of treatment, my disease is finally in remission, which is also a great thing because Crohn's sucks. But... one of the unexpected parts of being in remission though: puberty is resuming and my body is masculinizing at a very fast pace, as if it's making up for lost time. Everyday I grow more and more body hair (a few months ago my belly was completely hairless, now it's so hairy I can't take my shirt off without crying,) more facial hair (I barely had any before, now I have to shave everyday,) my face has been changing shape, my hairline is receding more and I feel like my Adam's apple is even getting bigger. This has all only been over the course of a couple months (it's been less than half a year since my body began doing this.)

It's putting me in a lot of distress knowing that my body is doing this. The dysphoria's getting so bad that I've thought about quitting my Crohn's medication and eating foods that I know will take me out of remission just so that the puberty will slow down again.

I can't start HRT right now, I live with my parents, I'm not ready to come out to them and I won't be able to move out for a long time. It's going to be at least a year before I can start HRT. My body is changing so fast though that I might end up looking completely different by then.

Is there anything that I can do to lower my testosterone and make my body stop doing this? Diet? Exercise? Vitamins (I've heard of something called Pueraria Mirifica to help feminize the body, does anyone have experience with that)? Anything at all?

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question or something that's been asked before, this is just the only place I can think of and I can't stand to see my body become like this anymore..."
zeshadowknows,asktransgender,Why can't we beat this?,"I have a long story, but in a way it is very typical.  I knew since I was 4yo I was a girl. I was very confused in kindergarten when sorted into the boys when the classroom was split, told my mother when I got home they had made a mistake, and was severely punished for saying I was a girl.  I learned to hide it, to bury it.

In 1999 I was sitting in a college dorm room with a knife on my wrist ready to end it.  I couldn't leave the room for class, to eat, for anything.  I decided to go see a therapist and give life one more try, if it didn't work out, I could always kill myself the next day.

I was diagnosed with GID and sent to a specialist who confirmed it.  They started me on HRT and I started the journey.  Speech therapy, SRS, all happened by 2003.  Things were going ok, I passed and was just experiencing the downsides of being female in the male dominated IT field.  Being passed over for promotions, having men not take my opinion seriously, but those are things all women face.  In 2005, I also faced something else many women faced, I was assaulted and raped.  

That shook me to my core.  I had only had a vagina for 1.5 years (the first 1 year of which you can't have sex) and now some monster was forcibly taking what I paid $25k to have ""installed"".  I made myself a target.  I was livid.  

By 2007 I was becoming more religious and was told I should be living as my birth gender.  I thought, well, at least I won't be a target and can walk outside alone without fear.  So I did it. I went on androgel and went back to as much of a ""male"" life as someone with bound breasts and a vagina can.

I hated myself, I hated my dysphoria, I hated I had decided to transition at all.
I ended up getting married to a ""straight"" woman in 2009.  By Aug 2016, the dysphoria was pushing those sducidal thoughts on me again.  It makes no sense, none at all.  There are SO many social disadvantages to being female. There are even MORE for being trans. When 98% of my body is medically sound, and only my brain is the issue, why can't we fix the brain?

I fought it. I fought it so hard.  In the end, I succumbed and went back on estrogen.  Having that way to dysphoria off of me was heavenly.  Then the crap started.  I lost my wife (she didn't want to be married to a woman even though she had been intimate for 7 years with a person with breasts and a vagina).  I lost my job.  I lost my religious community.  In three months I went from being dysphoric suicidal, to having nothing to live for suicidal.  Had I been thinking straight and known the costs, I don't think I'd have done it.  I'd have pushed harder against it.  Fought to wear the male mask day after day.

I feel like I lost everything for the approximation of a life.  I don't feel that I'll ever truly be ""female"".  There's that part of me that always is the naysayer.  Especially when my girlfriends say something about periods or they get pregnant.  I'm just on the outside looking into those aspects of life.  I can't make life.  All I can do is be a 6' plus sized approximation of a woman who threw everything away at a fantasy.  Just when I think I can get my mind forced back into a ""guy mode"" mindset, I see some really cute polish on a woman's hands.  Or cute sandals.  Or just a man holding his girlfriend, wrapping her up in his big arms.  And then NOPE, my brain reminds me I'm hopelessly girly inside.  I don't WANT to be a woman.  I want this gone. If there were a surgeon who could cauterize part of my brain and make it go away, I'd do it.  I don't want to be a woman, but apparently I am regardless.

How can I justify to myself that losing everything is worth ... this?

ladyturqouise,asktransgender,any tips for feminising a face with a masculine chin/brow?,"hey everyone, so I'm a young trans girl about to start HRT. I have quite a big chin and a prominent brow bone and have no idea how to try and draw attention from one without highlighting the other. If I get a fringe to hide my brow it makes my chin look even bigger and if I wear my hair parted to even out the size of my face my brow bone is so obvious it's like the worst forehead you could hope for as a trans woman lol. I'm about to start HRT and though I know it's not going to make changes to my bone structure I was wondering did anyone with this kind of face shape experience any positive changes to their face shape?? Looking for a little hope lol. "
ConcernedDad726,asktransgender,Can you help me help my son?,"Hi all,

I posted this in r/LGBT and was sent this way.

I'm turning to you for some guidance. My 16 year old son has recently informed his mom and methat he feels that he should have been born as a girl and he's expressed interest in physically becoming a girl. While I've tried to prepare myself as a parent on how to deal with the possibility of one of my children being gay, this particular scenario wasn't something I was prepared for. I will say that he will always be my child and I want to support him in every way possible but quite frankly his mother and I are unprepared for this. I've been able to guide my family through every difficult situation they've had in their life but I'm afraid I just don't have the experience or knowledge to help guide him in the way he needs. We have had him visit with a therapist (not to fix him but because they can help him more than I can right now) but I have a few questions that hopefully some of you can provide insight to:

- While he has expressed interest in physically becoming a girl, my first thought is to prevent him from doing anything permanent for a while because I would hate for him to do something he regretted down the road. As I type this I realize that sounds a bit ridiculous as he can't just go down to the local doctor and have major surgery as a minor. BUT, have any of you questioned your identity only for that feeling to go away and you become comfortable with who you are?

- He has a younger brother and while he informed his brother what was going on last week making changes to how he identifies himself, and how we as a family identify him, while at home is a tricky situation. Just today he told my wife that he would like to be referred to by a different name when at home but my first thought is how that could negatively affect him in relation to his brother. While I'm proud of how good my kids are, all it would take is one ill-advised comment from his brother to someone at school to cause major issues. For those of you that hid this type of thing from siblings, what were some of the difficulties you experienced and is there anything you did that helped you get through it? Those of you that DIDN'T hide this type of thing as a teen, what were some of the difficulties and good things you experienced, and do you regret anything about it?

- We have let him try on/wear some of his mom's clothes in the past and while he didn't say much about the experience I don't think it was negative. What are some other ways we can help him express himself or become more comfortable with who he is? What worked, and didn't work, for you?

- This situation is made even more difficult by the fact that he is reluctant to actually speak to us about this, most of the conversation happens via email to his mom. When he's home he acts like a normal teen and while he's very quiet at times it's usually because he's keeping occupied with Youtube, video games, etc. and he's not giving us a lot to work with. So I'm turning to you for help and ideas.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Teenage son is confused about his identity, help me help him.

EDIT: Thanks to those telling me that I'm the issue, I don't have the answers, etc. I came here for positive input and won't be responding to negativity. For those that have been positive, I give you a non-sarcastic ""thank you"".

EDIT 2: We just had a decent conversation about the whole topic and I can honestly say that many of the comments made me see the situation from the other side. Now at this point it's a when, not if, the hormone therapy will begin. Unfortunately the therapist I was referred to said she isn't trained in this topic and can't help. Thankfully some of you have already given me great resources to try to find someone who can. Thanks again and please don't stop posting if you have something to add!"
[deleted],asktransgender,My life as i knew it is over and im looking for some advice on how to start over.,"sorry in advance for the word blob, there will be a TL;DR at the end but please read it all if you can.

i am a 22 year old trans woman and i have been on hrt for 6 months as of this day of posting (its actually the anniversary in fact). last Thursday i cam out to my younger brother who is 18at my mothers instance. she has known for a while and is really not supportive but hadnt been openly hostile ether. 
    so last Thursday we (my mom and I) sit down with him and i come out because my mom didnt want me ""lying"" to him anymore. he didnt take it well, that night he never went to bed and we found him on the back porch in a daze the next morning not remembering how long he had been out there (its warm where i live so it wasn't a health issue r anything).
    Friday and Saturday he doesnt say much if anything to me and Sunday after get home from teaching Sunday school (i go to an open and affirming church btw, my family really does not) he confronts me while i am trying to take a nap and tells me he has a message from God for me.
     he starts telling me how God told him what i am ding is wrong and i need to stop transitioning because i am his brother and i am always going to be.That God made the sexs and people and the devil have been trying to destroy Gods work ever since. I tried to argue with him and reason with him (God made day and night but we also have dusk and dawn is one of my favorite arguments) but he didnt listen to me and he told me if i kept doing this path he would hill himself. 
       it was at that point i realized i couldn't talk to him, whenever he started threatening self harm he was past the point of talking. so i try and go to my car to drive to the library for me to cool off, its my favorite place in the world. he grabs my spare key off the counter and beats me to the car saying wherever i go he goes too. im about to yell athim when i see my grandpa driving down the street, he doesnt know im trans and if he found out he wouldnt help us out anymore, he is way past Conservative (we are a rather poor family but he has money) so i try and get my brother in the house before my grandpa sees us fighting. 
      we get back in and i try and leave again but he physically stops me. hes 6 5 and im 5 9, he has 100lbs on me and i lost my mussels a few months back to the hrt. i cant get past him so i run to my room and lock the door. i call my pastor who has been helping me transition ans thank God she picked up. i ask her to call my mom to see if she could calm my brother down. i hang up with her and right after that my brother (who until this point had been shouting all sorts of hateful things at my through the door) forced his way in. 
      this is where it got bad. i force my way past him this time and make one last run for it. he catches me and slams me into the door, then picks me ups and slams me into the floor and holds me down so i cant get away. at this point i pull a small pocket knife to try and scare him away but i cant hurt him, idk why, i just couldn't bring myself to do it. he gets off and i run to my car to leave and he lays down behind it forcing me there. i turn of the car leave my keys and just start running. 
    i end up at a park near my house and i get a call from my pastor saying she called the cops and wants to come pick me up. i tell her my location. the cops arrived first. i technically pulled a knife so i am the suspect and they pat me down and keep intro gating me all the while keeping my pastor away from me. after about the tenth time though the story they lock me alone in the back of the squad car and i curl up into a ball alone and cry. they kept calling me he too, i was in boy cloths though. they determine i am not a threat and dont charge me or my brother with anything. they take me back to my house, im in a total daze at this point and tell me that my pastor is going to take me to a house to stay at and to get my things. i dont talk to my family, they dint talk to me. i some how end up at a house of some people in my church. 
     since then i have been couch surfing with different friends from church afraid to go home. i did call my mom at one point and she seemed to blame me and defend my brother, it hurt to much to hear that she we didnt talk long. i have an aunt who is supportive and trying to help but my family is suborn. 
      it actually gets worse because i used to work with my mom at my moms very conservative church cleaning it. had the job since i was 15 and though all of this i have lost it.
     im still trying to go to school but its hard to concentrate. i have no job and only $700 to my name and no home and i dont know what to do.

TL;DR
Bad coming out to brother. assaulted and forced to leave house. family mainly supports him. everyone is finding out im trans before i wanted them to. homeless. mistraeted by police. just lost job and only $700 left in account. scared and while i have some support have never felt more alone. i dont know what to do...."

IceprincessOCN,asktransgender,[HRT related] I'm seeing a new endocrinologist soon. Is there anything I should ask her on our first consultation?,"Hey people! So I'm going to see a new endocrinologist. For starters she asked me to get the following bloodwork done:

* Kidney function
* Liver function
* Glucose
* Lipid profile
* Estradiol
* Total and free Testosterone (It'll probably turn next to none as I had an orchi done)
* Triglicerids
* Thyroid function
* LH and FSH
* Ovaric profile (lol)
* Prolactine (Part of ovaric profile)

She will probably change my medication and we'll discuss adding progesterone to my regime. I'm having some weight problems so we'll probably address that as well.

I'll also discuss switching from injectables to oral estrogen to allow for more stable levels.

Other than that, is there ANYTHING I should discuss with her and double check? Anything I could be missing? Any estrogen/progesterone meds I should suggest for my regime?"
mrbriyani,asktransgender,I got a haircut!,"I actually feel somewhat feminine! Even though my cut is more androgynous than a feminine cut, I still feel like it's right for me! It's sort of a pixie cut with undercut sides and back, so it can still pass off as a male cut, but I can feel feminine when I look in the mirror!

In fact, it's more than that. I'm actually smiling at my reflection when I come across a mirror! It's like I actually have ownership of my body in a small way, and it  doesn't feel like I don't have any agency in how I look, and I feel so much more positive now!

It goes to show how much of a difference having a body you actually feel is yours can make, even if this is just a small part of it all."
spinifex23,asktransgender,Trans(FTM) and an Amateur/Ham Radio Operator in the USA?,"Hello. I'm Dwayne. I also used to be a ham radio operator a while back, but I let my Amateur License lapse. Since I want to get back into the game, partially for emergency preparedness (I'm in Seattle, WA, which is both Earthquake and Volcano Country) and partially because I also love the technology/science behind it all. 

However, I do have a concern about Ham Radio and my name. I just sort of jumped into it again, and it didn't occur to me that the FCC will need my legal name - which is still my deadname - to issue my license. And I didn't find this out until the day I took my Technician's License Exam. Because it was easier to get my license than it is to legally change my name, I just went ahead with it, and passed the exam. 

But now what? Is anyone going to care if I just introduce myself as 'Dwayne' on the air? What if they look up my callsign on the FCC database,  which is publically searchable, and find my deadname instead - and ask about it? Because I don't feel comfortable using it because of both Gender Dysphoria, and I have a lisp, so it's hard for me to actually pronounce. ('Sara' turns into 'Fawa', which just isn't fun.) (If this helps at all, I'm on low dose Testosterone, but it hasn't lowered my voice to any appreciable degree. I'd also be talking on repeaters a lot, so I'll be using voice transmission.) 

I imagine the Venn diagram of 'transgender people' and 'ham radio operators' doesn't overlap a whole lot, and it may be easier to just pass it off as a 'wacky family nickname/my mom always wanted a boy, etc.' rather than trying to explain Transgender 101 to a bunch of fellow radio geeks who just want to talk about their antennas for hours. (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here!) 

Thanks and 73,
Dwayne"
guimobob,asktransgender,[MTF] Weight training.,"I'm really afraid of making things worst by doing weight training (that I do enjoy doing, but skipping shoulder days following Thinner Leaner Stronger from Michael Matthews).

A little bit of background: I've been on HRT for about a year and 3 months now. I am skinny and I was never really able to gain any kind of muscle pre-HRT. Somewhat pass on good days.

Is it a good idea to do wight training? I've just started with Thinner Leaner Stronger, not many results so far, but I need confirmation/validation that what I am doing isn't going to hurt me in the long run.

Scribble_Geek,asktransgender,"I don’t know how to start Transitioning, I feel a lack of motivation to do anything, but Dysphoria/Depression only keep growing every day now.","Hi, I’m currently 18 and have quietly been in the closet after accepting that I was trans (mtf) for a few years’ now. I’ve only been allowed to grow my hair out now after recently graduating and its helped with the dysphoria a little bit, but I still largely read “Male” and constantly hate how I look on a daily basis. I tried motivating myself months ago, telling myself that this year I would act upon and openly transition, but its already 3 months in and here I am sitting around not doing anything to better myself. I’m not really in the best living situation at the moment and I’m not ready to come out to my family at all; not until I’m away from them at least. I just want to start transitioning, but this is constantly stressing me out daily and I don’t know what to do or how to start.

I’m also trying to find local support groups/therapists and such to go to during my free time, but I haven’t had the best luck do to work. (I live nearby the Denver area; would anybody here know of places I can visit?)

Any advice is appreciated, sorry for my inconsistent rambling"
Sparks759,asktransgender,Is it normal to feel like your sexual preference is now a blank slate? (MtF Pre-Anything),"Probably a stupid question, I'm sorry. I've always been super kinky, super interested in girls, and last year discovered I was bisexual, though I still haven't acted on that yet. With this recent revelation that I'm trans, my sexuality is all over the place. I'm not experiencing desire for men OR women like I did a month ago. All the stuff I used to get off to is now either more arousing or not at all. Last night my wife dolled me all up and we had sex, and it was amazing, some of the best sex we've ever had, so nothing feels wrong there. I guess the biggest change is that I'm not experiencing many feelings of sexual aggression, that hard, urgent need to get off. I just don't know how to turn my own crank anymore?

I'm sorry, I can't totally figure out how to describe this. Everything is so weird now. Better, I think. But weird. "
genderboxes,asktransgender,"Folks who transitioned (socially and/or medically) without HRT, what were your reasons for not doing HRT?","I was talking with someone who was unsure about what gender identity is, and they asked about people who choose to transition without HRT. I realized as a kinda-binary trans man able to access and take T, I have little to no frame of reference about this. My guesses are that it often has to do with health contraindications, affordability, starting from a fairly passable point, not wanting a particular effect of HRT, etc, but I'd really like to hear more input on this, especially if your reasons include things outside of access/health issues."
throwaway2edgy4me,asktransgender,"As a minor, should I come out to my potentially transphobic dad?","First of all, I want to thank this subreddit so so much. All of you wonderful people have answered a lot of my questions and I think I've finally come to terms with my gender and realized I am, in fact, a girl. *(whew)*

So I'm 17, MtF, and I've been talking to a therapist (they know about the standards of care and WPATH etc *:)*, thank you!) about some of my dysphoria and having it all come to light has made me realize that I really need to come out soon. I've already told my mom and she's okay-ish with it, but we haven't really talked about it since. I'm also bipolar and I've been going through some deep depression but I'm starting to think it's more attributed to dysphoria than the bipolar itself. So if I'm depressed because I'm transgender, I should probably transition.. only problem is, my dad thinks I'm cis.

My father is the stereotypical conservative, Christain, masculine guy and I've overheard him talking to himself and saying both racial and homophobic slurs. I also know that he doesn't *like* the transgender community, but I've yet to get anything exact out of him other than the fact that he hates how sex-change operations are covered by his insurance. He did, however, say he's okay with ""people doing their own thing."" I'm working on trying to get an exact answer out of him.

But I'm still going to be in highschool until the end of 2018, and fully dependent under my parents for shelter and medical care (I take a few different medications for my bipolar disorder and still need regular doctors appointments). I have some money saved up and I'm trying to get a job so I can be self-sustaining, but my disorder isn't really managed and it's hard for me to be independent; I currently rely on my parents a lot but my grades still suffer.

Next week I'm going to bring this up with my therapist because we've started to discuss how serious my gender issues are, but I want to see if you lovely people have any input for my situation. I do know that waiting for me to turn 18 or to graduate high school is an option, and I guess I'm open to that idea if it's the only option, but I'm really getting sick of this dysphoria. Thank you for reading!

        dr bart is honest he explain a surgery is dangerous, and don't inveigle you with fake promise.

       cons, dr bart do have idea on what surgery need to do with patient, that has less patience to hear what the patient wants really.

        dr bart will send you a twisted simulation effect to tell you the results might come out, whitch thiese results seem good but looks subtle.

       dr bart didn't hear opinions of patients about the out come results, that he think all expectations of patients are

I've toyed with the idea of being a woman for a long while now. I've never cross dressed or done anything particularly effeminate, or masculine for that matter. I've done what takes my fancy, but recently it's gotten so confusing. I've been having bouts of suicidal ideation and potent self-loathing, and it's while browsing /r/makeyourchoice I've noticed, through a comment that linked towards another transgender subreddit, that I've always picked to be a female and that I might be so far in the closet as to not realize I might be trans. And for about a week now I've seriously toyed with the idea, but it seems to shift regularly between a... satisfaction(?) with the idea and revulsion or confusion with myself. I know that it's typical, but it seems to both worsen the suicidal thoughts and distract me from them. And I'm not a fan of the idea of makeup and feminine clothing, but I can imagine it being a part of the package if I was to go through with transition. I've been on the verge of breaking down into tears at work for the past two days and this whole thought process has been keeping me up at night.

A few years back I wanted to be as manly as possible and I had a few crushes on girls (only girls). One of those crushes caused me a depression too but i got over it. Anyway, after thinking that I might be trans the depression came back. My parents are pretty homophobic and I'm sure they wouldn't want to see me transition or anything. Also I'm in Romania which is not a very friendly country for LGBT people. I always feel happiness when I think myself as a girl and I sometimes feel Like that (Like my body is a female body) but I don't exactly hate my male body. Also when there's a female/male only thing (like bathrooms, clothes, choosing gender for an account etc) it causes me a lot of distress because I feel like choosing both). I don't know anymore. I'm kinda scared about this.I even thought about ending it multiple times (not only for this reason). I shaved once and my parents we're a bit mad about it. After that happened I had some kind of anxiety attack. I wanted to just die. I just tell myself that it's OCD or just a phase or that I just want to start my life again as a new person because i have a bit of a low self-esteem (because of depression).

shelbon22,asktransgender,Worst attack of dysphoria I've experienced combined with a new kind of dysphoria for me,"Okay so over the weekend, I experienced genital dysphoria for the first time. Literally everything else about me has caused me dysphoria but never my bits down there. I have kind of an odd experience though I think in that I was not in any away aware I was trans until well into adulthood because I was wrapped up in living as this male persona I built up.

So anyway, I won't go into detail but I was supposed to go to this lesbian bar near me over the weekend but that didn't happen for various reasons and I just had a huge dysphoria attack like I've never had before.

I know that a lot of us have dysphoria worse after starting to transition but this was something else. If I'd had an easy way of doing so, I think I would have killed myself that night. I just really really hated my physical existence to the point where I wanted nothing else but to die.

I think this is getting worse though because I'm starting to really settle into being female and really becoming comfortable with myself but then I still see a guy in the mirror.

So I guess my question is, aside from dysphoria getting worse in general for a while, has anyone else had certain types of dysphoria only after starting to transition?

MahoniaCrotalus,asktransgender,"Are there any laws about genetic/chromosomal ""abnormalities"" and HRT prescription?","TL;DR the title

I have a feeling this is going to be a silly question.
I realize that there are a number of intersex trans people and I'm just wondering if it's any more difficult for people with chromosomal differences to medically transition (pushback from doctors or even laws that block certain people, idk my brain has ridiculous thoughts), or are your genetics not even considered?

I'm pretty close to seeing a therapist and starting that whole process and generally am freaking out about various ridiculous things.

I'm likely a chimera with some parts of my body being xy and other parts being xx. I'm afraid to get this tested but over the years of being in science labs have looked at various cells in a microscope, some have barr bodies reliably, others don't. One eye is mildly color blind, one is not. my back and arms have a weird color pattern. One ear has dry wax and the other wet.

Part of me is afraid that if it turns out to be true that I have chimerism doctors would tell me ""Oh, because you have body parts that have female DNA we can't let you medically transition""

Is this ridiculous?"
AbbyWest,asktransgender,My body is metabolizing E2 into E1 far too quickly,"So, I've had an incredible opportunity to work with a doctor who is trying to establish a standardized healthcare standard for trans patients. We're slowly trying some new things, and so far things have gone fairly well.

However, we've hit a bit of a snag. We just discovered that my liver has been metabolizing E2 (estradiol) into E1 (Estrone) far faster than normal, which means I've got alot of the ""bad estrogen"" in my body.

The recruiter can choose not to move forward with anyone, and I bet short of ""sorry we don't hire transes"" I don't have any recourse.

Thankfully, now I've finished the legal name change and remade job hunting email and monster/indeed accounts so that I don't have to break the name change news to any potential employers or the recruiters who work for them, but I just had a recruiter today who wanted to do a phone screen and scheduled a specific time that he said he'd call at, but never called or responded to my subsequent emails. And after that I realized I still had my master's degree published research in old name on my linkedin although I changed the names on everything else over, so maybe I have to lose one of my big life accomplishments if I want to get hired someday.

ProjectAndrea,asktransgender,"No more running, have a few questions if that's alright","Hey everyone, long time repressed transgirl here that's decided to stop running.  
A few days ago I ordered some Cypro from QHI which will be here in a bit but in the mean time I wanted to seriously look in to what I'm to do. I know the basics from lurking, but I don't know about specifics so I have a few questions.  

1. I'll initially be self medding for a few reasons. One major reason is I've UK doctors are apparently notorious for gate keeping, so I'm curious as to how to approach this with my physician. If this is the case, are there any good trans friendly medical centres, preferably in the south west, that I could look in to so which would support me transitioning under informed consent? (Posted in r/mtf and one kind girl mentioned Dr Webberley who seems amazing)
2. I am not planning on starting on E straight away. Due to factors like being financially tight atm, I can't really afford both estrofem and cypro and so I chose Cypro since it should hopefully alleviate a lot of my dysphoria allowing me to just cope and get by for a while. There are other things like timing issues with me not wanting to risk getting outed when I make my annual visit home for xmas, but primarily it's due to cost concerns. However, Cypro on it's own carries the risk of depression and other health issues, so I guess I'd like to hear from women who've been in a similar boat and went on only AAs initially so I know what to expect, preferably Cypro for obvious reasons.
3. I'm pretty sure I don't need to worry about accidentally getting outed while I'm only on Cypro, and if anyone asks I can just claim that the weight loss/muscle loss/fatigue/whatever is just due to being under a lot of stress at work. But, if I did actually get outed it would likely be horrible so I'd like to know things to watch out for in terms of not getting outed. My flatmate is a very hardline catholic and I've heard her bash trans* in the past, so the main concern is avoiding ways that could have her peg what I'm doing since I'm confident she would not react kindly to it.  
4. Is there anything else I should really be aware of?

FoodOnion,asktransgender,DAE like really hope a trans person you interact with knows you're trans as well?,"To elaborate, at the first day of one of my old jobs I met a co-worker, and when I was having a conversation with them, we both kinda knew immediately that the other was trans.

Since then I always kinda hope whenever I meet a trans person that they just sorta know, you know? I know, people shouldn't assume, but I just kinda get excited for that clicking again. Is this weird, or is it something other trans folk experience too?"
pisang22,asktransgender,Experiencing dysphoria when observing sexism,"I was chatting recently to another FtM friend of mine and we realised that we both experience a lot of discomfort when observing other people being sexist. 

For example, watching a cis man call another cis man a 'girl' for not wanting to do a physically demanding task riles us. Not just because it is inherently unfair towards women, but we knew we could perform the same task pre- and post-transition and it leaves us feeling that our decision to transition was not valid. It might be even more grating on a MtF person because the statement also asserts that she should no longer be doing something she was capable of pre-transition. 

Its even worse reading arguments against women in combat positions in the military. Call me a coward, but while I'm all for it, I don't think I have the fortitude to join the argument.

Another example is watching documentaries about shipwrecks and hearing about the policy of 'women and children first' into lifeboats, and then wondering where the hell a transgender or nonbinary person is supposed to go.

One incident when growing up sticks in my mind. My highschool teacher divided the class into girls and boys to debate which gender was 'better'. I feigned sickness to avoid participating not because I didn't identify as male, but because each side would be forced to use sexist arguments and stereotypes against the other and one of them would have to be declared the winner. It felt disgusting and contrived; and deep down, I knew that I would feel like a traitor regardless of which side I was placed on.

I don't know if I am overthinking this or if this is an experience others also have. I get a grip by reminding myself that doing the right thing by my conscience is more important and braver than passing as male; though any other ideas would be welcome."
KnightessDiana,asktransgender,Favourite descriptions/explanations for what being trans feels like?,"I'll personally have to go with this quote from Julia Serano - Whipping Girl (I'm always amazed by how quotable and awesome of a book it is in general):

""All of the words available in the English language completely fail to accurately capture or convey my personal understanding of these events. 

For example, if I were to say that I ‘saw’ myself as female, or ‘knew’ myself to be a girl, I would be denying the fact that I was consciously aware of my physical maleness at all times. And saying that I ‘wished’ or ‘wanted’ to be a girl erases how much being female made sense to me, how it felt right on the deepest, most profound level of my being.

I could say that I ‘felt’ like a girl, but that would give the false impression that I knew how other girls (and other boys) felt. And if I were to say that I was ‘supposed to be’ a girl or that I ‘should have been born’ female, it would imply that I had some sort of cosmic insight into the grand scheme of the universe, which I most certainly did not.

Perhaps the best way to describe how my subconscious sex feels to me is to say that it seems as if, on some level, my brain expects my body to be female."""

This has literally taken over my life. Because most of a-level work is done outside of the lessons, I literally cannot do any of it because all I can think about is wanting to be female, imagining myself post-transition (I am pre-everything).


I've skipped sixth form (high school) on a number of occasions because of it. Sometimes I wake up at 5AM, I am really dysphoric and I end up just phoning in sick, but in reality it's because I am really dysphoric and I just need to process these thoughts more. I'm doing that today, I also did it on friday and a couple of weeks back.


OK, here is what it's like.

* At 3AM I am feeling suicidal, thinking about how much better my life would be if I were AFAB, Imaging life post-transition (which actually are really comforting). I get angry how I am probably going to have to wait until I'm 19 until I get HRT unless I self medicate (blame the NHS for that) and I just feel like killing myself is the easiest option.

* At 1PM I'm in a lesson, everything is normal. I see girls, and all I can think is about how 10 hours ago I wanted to be like them, wear the same clothes as them, have long hair, but I don't. I try and think about being like them, and I genuinely don't care about it. I don't even care about being male. It's actually completely fine. I feel weird for wanting to be a girl in a way.



What the fuck is going on? I want to be able to live as female, but I want to live as female and be comfortable doing it. Maybe I am gender-fluid, but I hate it. It's so frustrating that it constantly changes. I can go completely fine to suicidal in a few minutes, literally. 


When I'm with family, I do feel a bit more dysphoria than I would at college, but not suicidal. I don't know what to think. With family is when I am the most confused about everything

spookighst,asktransgender,Where do I go from here? (ftm),"I have a complicated story, and I'm not really sure where to get started. 

I'm currently a 23 y/o female in graduate school. My whole life, I felt like something was ""off"". When I was a teen, transgender wasn't as widely talked about and definitely not as respected. I didn't question anything. I kept living my life as I was. I went through the motions. I have done very well in school and I am completing my master's degree this year. 

As I've seen the transgender community grow, I've witnessed so many wonderful people transitioning and being happy. It warms my heart. It finally hit me that that was it. I wasn't happy.. and I wasn't happy because I didn't identify with my body. It wasn't just an ""aha"" moment. I've always known this. I've had severe depression and anxiety. I had been suppressing the reasoning behind it all. But I have finally accepted it.

I want to transition (ftm), but I have absolutely no idea where to start. I have so many questions, so many concerns. I've scheduled a meeting with a therapist that specializes in transgender patients and I believe that will help me significantly.

In the mean time, I can't get my brain to stop worrying about my future. I'm about to graduate, and I'm currently looking for internships / full time jobs. I've put so much hard work into my schooling and I don't want to lose all of that. 

I know there is no ""good"" time to transition, but is there a better time for this to happen? Do I apply to jobs as how I am now, and when the time comes for me to really move forward with my transition I talk to HR?

Another weird question is that: am I too old to begin a transition? Will the effects be less?

Any information / resources / articles are welcome. I am trying to educate myself as much as I can so I can move forward with this at a comfortable pace."
broken-neurons,asktransgender,Friend suggestion on Facebook that should be impossible - creepy,"I was just looking through the friend suggestions on Facebook. A very old ex girlfriend from 20 years ago popped up. I truly can't see how they made that link.

I'm very privacy conscious, especially with my trans identity, and have been trying to use Facebook again after a 4 year hiatus, but with a negligible footprint on FB.

 - I haven't had contact with my ex for twenty years
 - I don't have any shared Facebook contacts with her
 - I am using a completely different email address for my new Facebook account that she cannot have. 
 - I have never used the Facebook Messenger app on my phone. 
 - I have never used the Facebook app on my phone. 
 - I have never shared my contact list with Facebook.
 - I have never shared my mobile number with Facebook.
 - I have her in my contacts on Google Contacts, and hence in my phone contacts, but only an old Hotmail email address that I would surprised she even still uses. No phone number for her.
 - I have not viewed her profile, nor searched for her by name on Facebook
 - I even use a different name on Facebook to my legal name
 - I only ever use the Facebook mobile website on my phone
 - I don't live close to her, in fact I live in a different country, so we don't have any location proximity

The only thing I do have is WhatsApp on my phone, but since I haven't shared my mobile phone number with Facebook it can't have tied my Facebook profile to my WhatsApp contact entry. I also don't have my Facebook email address in my phone/Google contacts against my entry. It's one I setup purely for my trans identity.

waterdrop135,asktransgender,Coming out at work - what are my chances?,"Hi Everyone, I know this has been discussed a lot, but since coming out at work is such a enormous stress factor and a critical life changing event to me, I really still want to know what all you guys think about my specific situation. 

I'm MTF post HRT pre-op with a tiny size. Have been at my current (permanent and secure) position (in Ontario) for a few years with recognized top-notch performance. I have always been known as a ""somewhat different"" kind of ""guy"" at work. I wear men's clothing but they are the most feminine style I can find out of all (more like the east-Asian styles). I once had longer hair but I wasn't satisfied enough with my hair quality and front hairline back then so I cut it short again. Anyway, there have been numerous incidences where I was ""mistakenly"" (actually correctly) called Ma'am or (one of) ladies. Another stranger colleague told me he was expecting a guy but hesitated to come to me as I ""look different from most guys"", I knew he was trying to be polite. I do electrolysis around the lips and wax my eyebrows thin (not too thin but definitely noticeable). HRT has made my skin tone lighter, face shape changed to more feminine look and chest size is going up (but managed to stay unnoticed by covering with loose layers of clothing, at least I think so...) 

The more prominent change was voice. When I answer the phone, I almost always feel the hesitation from the caller as they question whether they were really talking to a ""guy"". To be honest I wasn't​'t even trying. I have practised feminine voice for years by myself and could easily pass if I want. But I thought I'm not ready to out myself yet so I kept it ""natural"". But guess what, the hormone change as well as years of practice has a deeper profound effect than I can control. So my ""natural"" voice now already sounds either ""in-between"" or still like a woman. I don't want to try the opposite either, as I really resent the male side of myself with a passion.

Besides all that, they also clearly know that I am very detail-oriented, have a soft and somewhat submissive character, and does many things at home that very few men would do (like sewing and knitting).

I'm sure other people at work have all noticed something, but not sure exactly what they are thinking of me. Considering this is an Asian-heavy department (both from the east and the south, some western Asian too), I guess most of them are conservative and may not even think of or know about the concept of trans. So chances are most of them would suspect I'm actually gay? (which I am, but not the male type of gay, ironically). For those.who would even consider the possibility of me being trans, I would be very curious about how they would interact with me once I'm out. 

Having said all that, I know I eventually will have to come out at work for sure. Changes in physical characteristics will simply be increasingly prominent, and I won't even be able to endure being called (and treated as) ""sir"" for too many more years. It might be just one or two years away.

One other reason I described how it is like of me to be at work right now is, I think I have already (subconsciously) started transitioning visibly in front of them with this strategy of changing my self image layer by layer. Not sure if it's a good idea, but at least I thought, or hope, it would make things a bit easier. Since I have already shown so many clear clues to them, I'm pretty much only leaving the literal outing statement behind, yet I haven't got any real negative comment on any of my behaviors by now (it is indeed a really politically correct workspace). I guess I should be a bit optimistic about the final outing then?

Sorry for the lengthy talk and a big thank you for your patience reading. If possible please do let me know what you think could happen if I'm officially out, and if you have any suggestions on how to best out myself, it would be so much appreciated!"

Igotantinmypant,asktransgender,I had GRS with Dr. Brassard two weeks ago. AMaA!,"So I had GRS two weeks ago and two or three users asked me if I could do a AMA since they were also going to have their surgery with him. 

First, post-op Life pro tip: practice grabbing stuff with your toes right now. My monkey feet have been a blessing!

My story: they have their own clinic in northern Montréal. You will first undress and do your admission (typical medical questions, weight and etc). The anaesthesia is a type of really powerful epidural and you will be put under afterward.

I woke up 2h30 later without any pain. It took me 4-5 hours before regaining usage of my legs and than the pain started. But they managed it really well. They will also put giant bags of ice between your legs every two hours. 

I had a pressure dressing which was sewn with suture points. A ""mold"" inside the vaginal cavity which also is hold with suture points, a drain for blood, a catheter for urine, a second dressing which is mostly to hold the ice bags.

I don't really remember day two. I was high as fuck

Day 3, you will be moved to their convalescence-recovery house next door. There, you will be taken care of by an amazing team and you will stay there for a week with other GRS patients. The food is amazing and everything is homemade, even the mayonnaise and sour cream! You have a room (could be shared with someone else) with your bathroom. There is also a living room where you can have visitors. Nurses are there to help you at every steps. Day 3 was hard as fuck. You are asked to stand, walk, sit and etc to help the recovery. It hurt as fuck. They also remove the bag from the catheter so you have to pee standing up through a tube. It suck. 

Day 4, they will remove the pressure dressing. The dressing feel like having a jockstrap so when they take it off, it feel great.

Day 5, they remove to mold. This was the best day of my life since the suture hurted every time I would sit. This feeling was quickly destroyed with my first dilation. 

Day 6 and 7, nothing new. I had a lot of fun with the others girl and the only guy. 

At home, you will have to dilate four times a day, two vaginal douche and two really soapy bath each day. Your vagina is basically a part-time job. Since they cant cauterize the wound, I am still bleeding a little down there. The bleeding can take four to five weeks before stopping. There will be blood. Basically, you will repay back all the missed periods of your life. 

Pain is a bitch but it doesn't hurt that much. I only needed Oxycontin three times. 

So if you have any question, ask away! I won't give any personal information nor share any picture of my brand new vagina though.  "
teacoaster,asktransgender,dysphoria disappeared?,"Hello guys,
I had intense dysphoria about my female body, voice and general appearence for about a week after cutting my hair really short (I posted about it at the time).
Then last monday it just disappeared but I can't stop questioning my gender and I have been thinking maybe my depression is a result of being trans but not realising it, as in having dysphoria but in the background.
I am wondering if it's possible to be trans but have episodes of dysphoria or to not notice it for a long time?"
Somptra,asktransgender,My hair is giving me massive dysphoria. Help!,"I try to tell myself hairline isn't -that- important, I tell myself estrogen will probably thicken my hair and make it less obvious, I tell myself maybe some of my follicles that aren't dead yet will be revived and if nothing else works - there's always hair transplants. But one month on HRT (not at the right levels yet ofc) and literally the only thing I'm worried about is my hair. I have no doubts whether or not I'm transgender, I have no doubt whether or not I want to continue HRT, but my hair is making me severely doubt if I'll -ever- end up passing. 

I'm thinning so badly on the front and when I put in a lot of effort, I can hide it with bangs and such, but even a little wind just ruins it and shows off how thin my hair is on the front, how bad the M-shape baldness is and how long my forehead is. 

It's driving me nuts. I'm afraid to go outside. The worst part is I hear different things all over, so I can only assume HRT won't make any hair return. 

It's super thick on the back, top and sides, but above my temples? It's a nightmare. Every time I look into the mirror I get a panic attack and massive dysphoria, to the point where I feel like this is the only reason I won't pass, and I've simply started transitioning too late because I'm an idiot. 

I'm 29 now, and the thinning started when I was in my early twenties, so that's ages ago. That's not coming back.

What is the truth? How important is hairline? Should I just wait and see what HRT does first? "
AllysaurusRx,asktransgender,I'm so fucking done with dating. Just want to vent.,"So I've been dating a guy for a while. He has the same interests as me, is funny, cute, all that. We're just a good match, and he's told me he's attracted to me both physically and mentally.

I'm really starting to develop feelings for him and think that ""This time. This is the time I finally find someone decent"". So I decide I have to tell him I'm trans before it goes any further. I do it over text because I was nervous as fuck and don't think I could even get the words out of my mouth. Waited like a complete nervous wreck on the verge of a panic attack for the response.

He sends me a long fucking reply talking about how he supports transgender rights and all that, but trans women should not be allowed into women's restrooms, how he doesn't consider us real women but hermaphrodites. Ending with ""I would still fuck you even if I'm straight"". Because obviously every girl wants hear that they're still fuckable after they've literally been reduced to nothing and kicked on.

I'm so fucking done.

I'm a young transgender woman who is pre HRT and living as a woman and sometimes, I feel like a man in a dress.

But, when I'm walking around the house with no makeup on, no bra and just in a nightdress or whatever, I feel like a man.

Like when I hug someone, I don't go chest to chest (when I'm at home and no bra, etc on) because I don't want them feeling how flat chested I am (is this dysphoria?). I often feel like people think they ""know the truth"" in the sense of that I was assigned male at birth and that they know that I'm ""really a man"" or something like that. Like, what does this sound like? Is this all normal?"
yetanotherlizard,asktransgender,[Self-harm TW] Ways to improve confidence?,"I'm 22 years old, MtF.

I've begun transitioning two years ago (December 2014), SRS planned for this october. 

So first, the positives: I pass well, have good friends that are accepting of who I am, have an appartment and possibly a job. 

The main problem is my low self confidence: I don't liek the way I look. I'm not happy at what I see in the mirror, and I still have periods where my dysphoria is so high that I struggle to get up and sometimes I don't bother getting dressed. In the worse cases, I will bash my head against a wall or scratch my arms until they get irritated or start bleeding. I am in no way suicidal, just disliking myself to unhealthy levels. 

What's getting me down a lot is that I still don't see *myself* when I look in the mirror, but someone else and it hurts a lot. I don't see me when I look at pictures, hear my voice (despite people saying it's feminine). Shopping is hard and kills my mood mostly because my frame (Shoulders and smallish breasts) make the clothes I would like to wear simply not doable. There's nothing I like about my physical appearance honestly.

I do feel *better* than what I felt before I started transitioning however, but I still don't feel happy about my body at all. 

All of this has been re-inforced by my social circle and family: I have beautiful female cousins and friends, who constantly get attention, compliments and have guys or girls look at them; compared to other girls I never get any positive attention. 

If you gals and guys have any idea as to how I can build any confidence, or start appreciating myself a bit better than seeing myself as the gutter-monster no one wants to compliments that would be great help."
JRSlayerOfRajang,asktransgender,Feeling close to the end.,"Once again I've turned to the people close to me for help and they've walked away. I'm always there for them, no matter what I'm having to deal with myself I still make time for them. That doesn't go both ways, I've realised. They won't help unless it's convenient. Even mild inconvenience seems to be more important to other people than my life.

My therapist's been away for weeks, and will be for another month. I've tried to talk to my 'friends', but they just won't listen to me, or are to wrapped up in their own stuff to care or even notice. And you can't exactly walk up to someone and say ""hey I need to cry on you for about three hours and talk to someone, anyone, about horrific abuse and trauma, and how even though I'm transitioning I still think about suicide every day and nothing scares me more than the idea of reaching out to you and you freaking out and not being able to deal with it. I'm free at six, how about you?"".

I can't even be honest about how dangerous things are really getting to get them to talk to me because they'd freak out and/or call the police and I'd be spending the next week cuffed to a hospital bed again.

Only one friend of mine agreed to talk with me, but then just went out drinking with other friends instead, got back a little while ago and when I politely asked why he didn't meet me when me agreed to, he said 'I don't care about your shit, man.' and stumbled off. Drunk or not that's the end of us, that sentence makes it pretty clear what he actually thinks when he's not pretending to care or treat me as a woman.

I have no-one I can turn to, and the people who I did turn to just don't care about me. It just goes to prove that I shouldn't be stupid enough to trust people. I thought things might be different; it's becoming clear they are not. I never trusted anyone when I was younger, and everything I experience just reinforces that, over and over again. Maybe if I hadn't started to open up things would be different. In some ways things were simpler back then, I could survive the things that are slowly killing me now.

I've always known I'd end up dying by suicide. I've also always known I'd be alone by the end. I keep telling myself that's a lie, but it's getting harder and harder to believe it. I don't want it, but sooner or later there just won't be enough keeping me here.

I don't think I'm likely to do it right now, not tonight. But the knife in the kitchen's looking better every single day, these days.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied here. I feel like my tear ducts are now a desert after crying so much. I'm not going to lie and say I'm ok, but I'm going to keep trying."

RsDenieru,asktransgender,"Do you ever feel like you periodically lose focus on your transition, due to a busy life?","Hello lovely people!

Over the course of the last 4-6 weeks, I've been extremely busy with my life, due to starting university again on full time, after only spending a few hours weekly on it, due to a change in education. Because of a busier day, I feel like I'm losing my focus towards my transition, because I don't have the time to think about it on a daily basis.

I recently started getting approved for hormones, as a part of my medical transition, and the main issue here is that in Denmark, you have to go through several psycologist consultations, before you can get approved. Seeing as I'm losing my focus though, I feel that it's hard to argue about why I should get approved for hormones, and why I feel like I feel. 

I don't know if this made much sense, but hopefully it did, and if you have a similiar experience, how did/do you keep your focus?"
lyn46,asktransgender,Should I try cycling sub-lingual estrogen?,"I was on bi-weekly estrogen injections up until summer of 2016 when the supply of it dried up here in NYC. I felt incredible back on the injections. Great mood, stable, all that jazz. Then I switched to the pills. While I can't say they're *dreadful,* I can't say I've had the same mental benefits that I had on injections since switching. I was prescribed 8mg daily, and was at 200mg Spiro (although I've lowered it to 150). 

Basically I'm wondering if anyone on here has had positive experience cycling their sub-lingual estrogen in order to mimic the patterns of injections, because the consistent dosage of estrogen makes me feel like crap. Also I'm *considering* starting progesterone in the upcoming months, but I'm undecided as of right now. Thanks in advance!"

I have only come out to a few of my best and most LGBT cool friends, and they have been good about it. I don't know if this is stupid or not; but they didn't have like any reaction at all and it makes me feel weird. I suppose it is nice because they support me, but at the same time it feels like they are actually actively DISINTERESTED in it.

Unrelated to being trans, I have had a very difficult few months since this past October. I was hit by a drunk driver and almost died. Ever since this happened I have been getting more and more depressed every single day. I am not going to kill myself (mostly out of cowardess), but I wake up every day just entirely hating myself. I have been doing too many drugs as a way to cope and I want to be happy, but my best friend left to go backpacking in South America and I am not in my home state so I lack any good friends here.

I am just really sad right now. About so much. I have no one to talk to, and I feel like I will never be who I want to be. It would mean the world to me if someone would just be my friend. I am crying so much without any idea of what to do. Thanks, and sorry this isn't much of a question. "

A year has passed since I was admitted for an appointment there, and I finally have an appointment scheduled for March 31st, 11am, which, i am ecstatic about, honestly!! :D

 However there are a few questions I would like to ask;

- What sort of questions will the therapist ask?
- How long would I have to wait for the dosage appointment with my GP?
- How long till first perscription of HRT after dosage appointment?
- Should I choose injections over pills, and what would be given to start me off? Anti-androgens? or a mix of estrogen and something else?

We are all really passionate about film and want to continue to work together on projects and enter into festivals with the aspirations of winning of course. 

The dilemma is that I have yet to come out to them and I'm pretty positive they don't know because of how they treat me and talk to me; Periods, abortions, all that stuff and I don't want that to change if it doesn't have to because often when I come out to people they treat me differently even if they're accepting. It's like having a criminal past or something, like I'm not ashamed of being trans but I don't want to be excluded because of it either.

We're entering into a festival in a few weeks and I think we have a chance to win. I don't want to be outed by some person in the crowd in front of my team but idk if that will happen but there are quite a few people who know I'm trans. 

So I want to get ahead of that, I don't want my group to distrust me nor do I want them to treat me differently so I'm sorta stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Any help would be greatly appreciated by answering (with any detail that you think important) all of the questions below. I've tried to keep them open-ended so that you are not guided by me, but if you need clarity I will do my best to answer any questions you have.

If your answers are too private to you... I'm very new to Reddit, but if there is a way of PMing me, please feel free to.

1) For those who've transformed their bodies, how long did it take for you to settle into your new body?

2) If you had the option of ceasing to be any gender, would you take that option?

3) How have you psychologically changed after transitioning?

4) How do you react to the prejudice of others after your transitioning, and how has it changed from your reaction before the transition? Were they consistent?

5) What is your philosophy of the psychological purpose of the body? Does that change with transitioning?
(Example: Some people think of their body and mind as separate, and so their philosophy on the body is as a means of bodily functions to sustain the mind [put food in, bathe, all for the purpose of reading or playing video games]. Others think of their body as a bastion of pleasure, enjoying great sex/food/experiences that align with their body philosophy.)

As got older didn't change, thou did try to ""fake it till I make it"" and act masculine which was a bad idea. (22yo)
Started to see gender therapist in December
Started hrt in Jan

My main worries are that I'll never pass, or I'm doing it for wrong reason. That i would make as a horrible woman and maybe I'm just lying to myself and should try to just accept/embrace being a ""guy"".

Since started hrt my sex drive is gone and shrinking which is fine.

But main concern is that now that I'm on it, like idk. I don't feel too masculine nor do I feel like a woman? I tried to wear too much feminine attire off the start and now don't really wear any attire. Is it normal to have doubts worries ect while on hrt and is it normal to not have any desire to change ish on it?

What is more difficult to sort legally is that Bianca has started a blog of her feelings. I don't want to link it here because it is not anonymised - it uses everybody's real name and has photos of their child. It is a way for Bianca to express and work through her feelings, but is quite vicious.

It talks about Alice as if she is dead (while acknowledging that 'he' is alive, a liar, and has destroyed 'his' daughters life and made victims of Bianca and Chloe). Recently, she started targeting the 'small-hearted and hateful' family of Alice - who are daring to support her.

Bianca posts on her Facebook when she updates and gets so many comments about how brave and good she is - I find it quite difficult to handle and I know that Alice does too.

So I was hoping the community might help - this can't be an uncommon occurrence. What should we do? How can we cope with this public outpouring of hatred?"
SomeBWord,asktransgender,"For those of you who struggled with their sexuality... how did you like, figure it out?","So I apologize for how vague this question is.  For the longest time I identified as asexual, but I'm slowly starting to realize that that was mostly due to body dysphoria and not being able to think of myself in a sexual context whatsoever.

Now I just kinda feel vaguely stunted.  Like, I don't really know where to begin to even explore my sexuality.  Like... aesthetically, I can appreciate all genders, so I'm inclined to think I'm somewhere in the pansexual zone, but I don't even know like... how I'd have sex with my current genital configuration being what it is(I've tried with a previous girlfriend and had a full panic attack).  It just all feels overwhelming to even consider and aghhghhgh.

Like how did you folks start to figure this stuff out for yourself?"
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,How ti stop looking up to the wrong gendered role models?,"Also i cant think abkut surgery realistically

Hi

I am insanely confused with my life and its dumb of me but its how i am right now, my brains a shipwreck, so yeah ok here i go

I wish i was born a girl, but i think i mostly want that for the social reasons, though i believe ill like having a vagina better than a penis (but its terrifying to think about that realistically so i cant xp). 

But i automatically lesrn from my dad. Livinf with the parents again after failing at college (almost made it) and hating life, so i detscj and get lost in my own mind. I feel i follow and act like my dad, and i cant help it, i noticed i have a drive to do it that i cant control and it bothers me.  How can i ever learn how to be a girl when almost all my role models are male, and the most influential one is living with me. And i struggle to let myself learn from women!!! Its like i create mental blocks for myself and then blind myself so i cant tear them down, and im stuck learning from my dad.  I think part of it is shame at who i am, beneath the surfsce. Never directly shamed, only indirectly.  And i feel bad, like im letting him down.  Evem when he says im not.  I feel i see it in his actions when i start being/acting female. I can never do anything for myself. But i also tend to be detsched from reality for these reasons, so i might be seeing him that way when hes actuslly not seeing it that way, seld fulfilling prophecy. I have less than zero self esteem.


TL;DR i dont know how to think realistically about surgery, yet its years away and im depressed, and yet for some reason i continue to learn from and act like men even tho it doesnt make me feel good.  I zone out and get lost in my head to avoid reality but that makes it worse and i feel i let myself get socially used.

 I thought i could think myself through it all but thinking gets me nowhere when i cant confront..cant deal with..cant handle..csnt function with the emotions..cant learn how to function woth emotions xp"

hjkupsjdhjsheik,asktransgender,"Had SRS with Dr. McGinn yesterday morning, am in hospital and very bored. AMA","[Here's me](https://imgur.com/a/DPB4F) in the hospital bed. 

**SRS T-2 Days Saturday**

I spent most of the day doing household chores; laundry, cleaning my room, and finally packing my bags! I started the liquids only diet this day, so i had a few Boost nutritional drinks, and a couple of protein smoothies from the store. I couldn’t fall asleep this night due to anxiety for a while but eventually I managed to get a few hours rest. 

**SRS T-1 Day Sunday**

Woke up at 4am, loaded up the car, and off we were to the airport. I requested to drive even though my mom and I were getting dropped off by my dad, since I know it’d be my last chance to drive for a few weeks at the least. We got to the airport and quickly made it though security since it was so early. I had a bit of a freakout trying to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything, but it seems that I did a good job cause I still haven’t thought about anything I forgot. We got on our first flight to ST Louis, making sure to sit up in the front (open seating), since I’m not fond of airplanes and like to be one of the fist humans off of them. I ended up having to put my carry-on in the overhead bins a few rows back though. I guess the business class all put their bags up front instead of above their own heads. We had a super short connection in St Louis onto the Philly plane, but thankfully the flight attendants were cool and helped me grab it when we landed so we could peace out towards the next gate. I should mention that this was the day I was on clear liquids so all I really had to drink was Apple Juice and Sprite in the airport/on the planes. 

Once we landed in Philly we got a rental car and started to drive it out of the lot only to be greeted by gross scraping sounds, so we parked the car in its original spot and got out to find that parts of the undercarriage were hanging loose and scraping the road. We exchanged it for a different one, which turned out to be dirty AF both inside and out. Also, Fiestas are small freaking cars and we were barely able to put our luggage in it. Not particularly wanting to exchange another car though, we just headed to the hotel. We got to the hotel and about an hour after arriving I drank the Cherry flavored bottle of magnesium citrate, which wasn’t that bad. It tasted almost like a Cherry Jolly Rancher but not quite. Apparently beef/chicken broths count as a clear liquid so I drank a lot of that to stay hydrated at the hospital. 

Bowel prep sucks, girls. After a few hours spent on and off the toilet, wiping starts to become super painful. I watched a bunch of The Flash while constantly moving between the bed and the bathroom. I was able to take one last shower at about 11pm, then I fell asleep. 

**SRS Day 0 - Monday** 

Woke up at 5am, and did an enema to finish clearing out my bowels, and then got dressed in some comfy sweatpants and a tank top. We arrived at the hospital at 6am, and were the only ones there pretty much. I was quickly checked in and signed a bunch of consent forms, had some more labs done (Dr McGinn orders more labs the morning of), and was taken to a holding room with my mom and I changed into the hospital gown and gave all of my stuff to my mom We hung out in here until around 7am when I was taken to the prep room. It was starting to get really surreal at this point. I put my glasses in the glasses case and handed it to the nurse. She put the famous leg huggers on me, which are like these cloth wraps that fill up with air to help pump blood while laying prone on one's back and prevent blood clots. 

Dr McGinn’s assistant Cristal showed up and had more papers for me to sign acknowledging risks and consent to operate and all the fun stuff. The anesthesiologist and a bunch of other nurses appeared and were bustling around. 

McGinn herself showed up and asked if I was ready, who was here with me and what’s my mom’s name. I told her they still needed to put in a couple of shots and she joked with me briefly about putting a lot of shots in me that day. She has a bit of a rep for being not great at bedside manner, but personally, I like her. Besides, she’s not my mom, she’s a surgeon. The first nurse gave me a shot of a slow acting blood thinner into my belly on the right side(the needle was fine, but the stuff in it burns a bit), and then my IV was put in. They anesthesiologist said I’d be out in about 5 minutes, and I vaguely remember being wheeled out of the prep room. 

Next thing I know, I’m waking up in recovery. First thing I can think is “noooo, let me sleep” and “I’m so thirsty”! I’m extremely groggy, but I remember being asked by someone if I had any allergies, and I told them no, not that I know of. I drifted in and out until they decided I was there enough to be taken to my hospital room. Shortly after getting into my hospital room, my mom comes in and what a sight for sore eyes. They hook me up to vitals readers and my morphine drip along with showing me how to call for help if I needed it. Next I got the nose tubes with oxygen which are hooked up to a machine that beeps at you if you don’t breathe deep or often enough. And I have to periodically use this weird apparatus where you inhale VERY slowly to make sure your lungs are filling up which helps exercise them after anesthesia and helps prevent pneumonia since you’re lying prone on your back.  This sucks. You’re in some pain, lying on your back and cannot move. I use the morphine to take the edge off and drift in and out of sleep while making sure to keep up on my breathing apparatus thing. In the evening, I called with my dad. My mom left to the hotel since she didn’t wanna sleep on the couch in the hospital room. The first night sucked. I’d get a couple hours sleep here and there but was woken up a few times by the breathing thing and by the nurses checking my vitals.

**SRS Post-Op Day 1 - Tuesday** 

Today my mom brought me my tablet and keyboard/mouse as well as my headphones so I can watch some Netflix. I spent most of the day just being bored, watching Netflix, and napping. One of McGinn's assistants (Brianna I believe) stopped by, checked things out, and gave me some tilt to the top of my bed so I'm sitting up a bit instead of laying all the way down. Maybe an hour later the nurses came back and helped me stand up on my feet. They had me stand on my tiptoes and back down onto my heels and then back up for about 5 minutes total. I was expected to get lightheaded or faint but it ended up not happening which was good news, the nurse said I did great.  Ever since, I've been doing more of the same. Netflix, sleeping, and listening to music. 

My mom went back to her hotel so she can sleep in a proper bed and get some decent food also, and so here I am.

Beyond this buccal fat removal is also what I want. I could do a chin and jaw surgery but my friend says to go to Thailand or Dr. Bart In Belgium for that purpose. I did see some reviews of dr. Bart and people say he's amazing given he has done over 3000 FFS surgeries. However I was told hes good for bone reconstruction but terrible at soft tissue work. 

My questions are 
1. Is doctor Zukowski really aggressive and is open to help his patients turn their looks or noses in my case "" Barbie doll "" like? I would love a doctor to be aggressive to feminize my nose as much as possible 

2. Should I consider him for jaw and cheek bone reconstruction? I could if the price wasn't bad. 

So if everyone or anyone has ideas or opinions on his work and the history of what he's done to themselves or friends or such I would appreciate honest opinions if he's the right surgeon to go to to get the Barbie look nose I've always wanted.

willownwookie,asktransgender,"How should we use the word ""feel""?","I've been reading some posts and comments and I started getting uncomfortable with the word ""feel"". I'm a transwoman, and been on HRT for 5 months and full time for a month.

Back to this ""feel"" thing. I read some posts that said trans people ""feel"" they are in the wrong body. This threw me. It seems to imply something less than the intrinsic knowledge I have that my brain and body don't match. This isn't a feeling, it is a fact.

I can use ""feel"" in a different way and be comfortable. My body ""feels"" (actually right now ""felt"") wrong. 

So, ""feel"" as in sensation is good and ""feel"" as in believe doesn't work for me.

I honestly am a semantics junky and want the words to be just right. Am I being too sensitive or is this clarification important.

kara_lexx,asktransgender,Comming off of Spirolactone (200mg) and Estradiol (Estrace) 4mg,"Hi :-)

I was wondering if anyone knows how i should come off of this?  I guess by doing 1/4 every week or 2 weeks?

I'm taking spirolatone + estrace pills daily.

I can work on the last half of my dose ( spirolatone +  estrace) since that's what I'm taking just x2.  I was gradually put on :).

I started 2 years ago almost (not at this dose).  Last week I tried just not taking the last spiro and estrace and it wasn't a good thing so now I'm currently at my full spiro plus 1 + 3/4 estrace :/

So should I just cut my last half of the dose spiro +  estrace) both down by 1/4 or should I do the estrace first? or the spiro?

Maybe cut down by spiro (1/8)? and(1/8?) estrace per week or two weeks?  At same time?  

Thank you so much !"

I started out and went gradually up from 2mg estradiol hemihydrate to 10mg (very recently) a day, as well as I'm taking 100mg of cypro and 2.5mg of medroxyprogesterone each day.

I know these were coming from a place of just worrying for my well being and he said he would support me however everything turned out.  We talked for a while about everything and I explained how I was going to be going at everything slowly because one of my biggest fears was getting overwhelmed and staying in control.

s_feld,asktransgender,"have supportive friends, still feel super alone","i don't know what fucking ends of the earth i have to reach to feel like people can begin to empathize with me, but so far it feels like there is a massive chasm between my experience and the way people around me understand it. people around me have compared my dysphoria to really wanting to get a haircut or having acne. it honestly hurts so much and it's so alienating. i try to explain that dysphoria is like an entire other spectrum of feeling but it feels like so few people internalize that or really take it seriously. i hate feeling so  vulnerable and then being so let down by other peoples complete lack of understanding or even compassion. 

i haven't had the most difficult life, but dysphoria is so much worse than any pain i've ever known. i feel so alone knowing that nearly everyone around me has no idea what its like. they just live their lives unimpeded by this weird hellish world that i feel like i am constantly managing, that often gets the better of me, that's often so deeply disturbing, painful and is always exhausting. i feel wildly angry thinking about how easily people dismiss it.  

i also feel really alone and honestly shamed in my circles for wanting to be gender conforming. often when i express the pain i feel surrounding my facial hair or my voice the vibe i get is like ""oh she just hasn't accepted herself yet"". it feels so fucking frustrating getting that from my cis girlfriends, who a) aren't just simply listening and respecting my feelings like i wish they would be and b) don't seem to be asking themselves what it would feel like for them to have a flat hairy chest or a low voice, or maybe more importantly what it would be like if they were forced to live as boys their whole childhood. and i guess, although this might not be true, the fact they aren't asking themselves those questions make me feel they don't take my gender as seriously as they would a cis womans.  

i feel like trans people are just expected to be this norm-challenging aestheticized spectacle and that it's wrong to just wanna fit in. it feels like we're supposed to be pawns in the fight for gender freedom, that we're supposed to just take the abuse, while meanwhile cis people concern themselves with worldly things like their jobs, relationships or whatever. and heaven forbid we make them feel too guilty about it. like what the fuck is so wrong with just wanting a ""normal""(ish) life? 

this shit is honestly driving me mad. anyone else have similar challenges? have any suggestions on how to deal?

i feel like there's a lot more i could say, or more specificity i could give, but i'm feeling super emotional rn and just need to express this. "
MoreNMoreLikelyTrans,asktransgender,I'm frustrated due to doubts and I don't know how to feel or proceed.,"So 15 months ago someone said something to me that brought a wall of repression crumbling down.

3 months later I had an appointment to relieve HRT. 

The week of the appointment I cancelled because I both was no longer feeling transgender, I want to lose weight, but most of all because my closest friends were warning me I was rushing to fast with this. So I shelved it and went on my merry way. 

During this time I've purchased clothing and worn them privately a and publicly  (only underwear).

Right now I'm wearing a bra and thong under my male clothing for no reason other than because ""I want to"".  

When I'm honest to my self, I've wanted HRT since I found out it existed.  I just blocked it out due to ""morals"" and religious beliefs. 

Here's the kicker though.  I don't feel like a female. I don't behave the way I expect females to behave. I don't have hobbies or mannerisms that align with female ones. 

I've been playing the private server for wow Elysium and I decided when I planned to play that was to play in girl mode.  Which to me meant fully embracing those mannerisms and behaviors that I want to do. Awesome smilies. Sly-ness. Goofy.  What ever. Things I don't feel comfortable doing in real life. To say I'm not comfortable doing them is wrong.  I don't even think they are possible. (I'm probably wrong about that) but thats how I feel.  And that's been a so-so experiance.  I feel more shame and guilt than elation. Sadness I'm basically lying to the players I'm making friend with.

Can anyone who's transitioned or transitioning or thinking of transitioning relate and offer advice on these feelings.  I wish transgenderism wasn't so indefinable.

horriblekids,asktransgender,how did you break it to your unsupportive parents once you started planning for surgery?,"So my parents are ridiculously unsupportive and just avoid the topic of me and trans stuff in general. It's uncomfortable and for the most part I let them live in their fantasy world where they still have a daughter or whatever they think about me, I don't really know, but I booked my consult for top surgery today and had the realization that I'm going to have to talk to them about it.

I want to avoid a meltdown as much as possible because my mother is a massive narcissist. The rest of my family is super supportive and amazing and I'm going to ask my aunt if I can stay with her for about a week after my surgery because she has two children that are medical doctors and she lives about an hour away from the surgeon. But I don't really know how to talk to my parents about it without my mother acting like I'm either a) dying because surgery or b) making it all about her and How I Could Do This To Her. 

So... any tips on how I can manipulate this conversation into going well? I'm in a pretty good place with my relationship with my mother right now. She's mad at my brother over something so I'm temporarily the golden child, and I think breaking it to her while that's happening has the best chance of success."
platinum_vageen,asktransgender,"When dating someone, is there a way to be sure that that person is sure of his/her gender identity?","Are there questions to ask? Discussions to be had? 

My boyfriend (30) is very progressive and open-minded. Early on, we had a few thorough discussions about transgender people in general, and our own senses of gender identity. 

(For what it's worth, my own narrative fits very well with a classic trans-narrative as seen on this subreddit. Except that I've never suffered any inner turmoil about my body.)

He was always sure of himself, no issues with his life, his body, or his identity, etc, etc. He has great passion in life and lots of joy. His family is open and not religious or anything like that. 

After more than 2 years together, however, he has started having new thoughts... occasionally thinks about having breasts. And thinking about a penectomy is arousing to him. We've discussed this in depth, talked about hormones, toyed with the idea of cross dressing and make up, and after all that, he says he doesn't want to be a woman. But on occasion he thinks about having breasts. And he finds these thoughts illogical. 

I've been creeping this sub for more than a year and I know that a lot of people start having these thoughts later on in life and it grows and grows until they end up transitioning full time. 

So although he says he doesn't want to be a woman or trans... I can't help but think he will eventually discover he is trans. 

So I guess it seems like... Literally anyone could realize they're trans at any
point in time. 

Do you think this is accurate? Like there's no way to be sure that a supposedly cisperson is sure of his/her gender identity? And no way to be sure that any particular person won't ever transition? 

I'm beginning to wonder myself when I'm going to realize I need to transition...

I mean I really don't think I will but. Why wouldn't i? 

Also, I'm not bi, so I'm kind of worried that if I start dating again, I might end up with someone who realizes later that they need to transition..."

Hahaimtrulyinsanelol,asktransgender,Quick Question about MtF HRT dosage?,"Hi, I am incredibly happy to say that I finally got to start hormones today!

That said, I was prescribed estradiol 2mg and Spiro 50mg to be taken once daily. Except my doctor prescribed 60 pills in each.

So I'm a little confused. Is this because my initial bloodwork needs to determine my dosage? Or is there a reason she would prescribe something for what seems like half the typical dose, with double the pills, but explicitly state to be taken once a day?

Should I take two of each anyway? I know we talked about how 4-6 mg of estrogen is typical when my ugly sac is shooting out testosterone.

She probably won't be able to answer for me a week or so, so it's relatively important I figure out what to do here. Well I guess maybe not in the long run but for now anyway.

She's been working with trans patients for about 2.5 years, and seems to know what she's doing, but I wanted to make sure of her intentions.

I'm not really comfortable with posting pictures online so I couldn't get advice (also I'm scared of being hug boxed and being told ""no you're the prettiest girl who passes super well you'll be fine"" when that's just not true). 

I don't want to get FFS. It seems really scary and if something goes wrong then your only face is completely ruined and it doesn't seem worth it. Also I probably wouldn't be able to afford it forever. But I want to look feminine, like a girl. And I just see a really masculine face but that is likely due to having seen myself/being treated as male for the past 19 years it's kind of a habit.

I'm also really scared that if I got it I wouldn't feel like me anymore. I have these issues with trying to be nothing like my last self but it seems so scary to be in a body that doesn't feel like mine (hey just like being trans ha ha) but if I didn't recognise my face what if it made me even more depressed?

1) what made you want/need it?
2) how did you decide who to go to?
3) what surgeries did you get?
4) how much did it cost?
5) what was recovery like?
6) how do you feel about your decision now?

As you can see, I marked my prolactin and GFR because I'm worried about them. But high prolactin is caused due to cypro, and GFR is low because they miscalculated something.

I haven't been tested for B12 deficiency and I forgot to take it, so it also may be a cause. But I'm worried that cypro is destroying my health, so I think that I'll get an orchi this year anyway. Once I'll save for SRS I'll need a skin graft anyway, so I don't really care."

Recommendations for electrolysis, surgeries, etc. are more than welcome. Specifically, I live in the city of Soldotna, and travel is not an option at all unless I can get a referral to a specific place. I have a GoFundMe page, if that is of any interest to you. Also, sorry if posting links to GFM pages is in violation of the rules somehow. If someone calls me out on it, I will be quite amicable to removing the link.

DeeDeeDa,asktransgender,Leg lengthening surgeries (or shortening for MTFs),"I was just talking about lengthening of the legs on /r/ftm and this got me curious. I am not tall, so I am seriously considering that. The idea of having to stop T to heal better bothers me a bit, but if it takes estrogen to be taller, why not?

I would prefer to do just the tibias. I am just starting to read about that surgery. There are much more people here on asktg, so I wonder if any of you guys got this surgery? (or for transgirls, shortening as it should be the same)

Amethyst_Lynx,asktransgender,Seeking advice for dysphoria post hrt,"I'm 30, mtf, and I have been on hrt for a little longer than the last year and a half. Overall it's been amazing. But in the last month or so, my dysphoria has come back hard. It's gotten to the point where it's almost constantly on my mind, where my motivation is almost non existent, and where I don't really care about much. It's not as bad as it was pre-hrt, but it is getting there.

I've also had a lot going on in my life in the last month.... reaigning my position at my job, selling my house, moving cities, living with roommates after 5 or 6 years of not having roommates, dealing with my last year of law school. But the dysphoria on top of all of that... I just feel like I'm close to the point of where I can no longer handle things."

stupid999,asktransgender,Is it possible to 'realise' you're trans because of seeing someone else who is / is close to trans?,"Okay, possibly really stupid post but I've been really anxious about my gender identity but not in the sense of ""I thought I was cis"", in the sense of ""I thought I am trans"". Basically I get pretty bad anxiety in general and now I'm worried about not really being trans. I did feminine stuff as a kid, I knew trans people existed but I never felt a real major urge to be a girl or be genderqueer (in fact at one point I used to make fun of them, sorry) although I will say something was always 'off' so to speak and I do get dysphoric about stuff. I also didn't really understand it UNTIL I met a transman and his SO. I honestly can't remember when I started questioning properly and started to realise ""hey... maybe I'm just a little wee bit trans"" but I think I may have thought about it because of him and his SO as it was around that time and the first person I told was his SO. They're both nice people, I like them both dearly (if you're reading this Ike, heya!). I'm really scared that maybe my mind has somehow decided that to fit in better with these two people I should 'become' trans. I've never made a mental thought to decide that, it's also really illogical. You don't 'become' trans. I suppose what I'm really asking is why the hell I never thought ""maybe I should be a girl..."" before I met those two lovely people and is that normal? I guess I'm also kinda asking for validation from other people who have 'realised' so to speak because of someone else due to them being trans or something. 

Sorry, this is really a bit rambley haha. Just really anxious and it's not fun :(

SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Summer clothing?,"Still deep in the closet professionally, that isn't going to change until HRT does its thing. To help myself cope with the wait I've been planning/building a wardrobe. 

My rule of thumb if I can't wear it out, then I'm not buying it. This limits me to masculine women's clothing or andro. As of now that is sweaters and khakis (not a jean person at ALL). 

When summer rolls around I have no idea where to go with this. T-shirts can only go so far, and its all I ever really touched. What are some good ideas for things I can easily wear when presenting as male?

Terra2278,asktransgender,Blood test concerns.,"I just got my current blood test results back, but my next appointment with my doctor isn't for about 2.5 weeks and I am concerned and wondering if anyone might have some insight into what will happen next.

I have been on oral HRT for 5 months, first 3 at 2mg estradiol, 100mg spiro, the rest of the time at 4mg E (2 2mg pills), 100mg Spiro. I take all 3 of my pills Here are my concerns...

1) My ALT (SGPT)is at 61 with an expected range of 0-60. So it is slightly elevated. Doing research it seems like this is an indicator of liver trouble. Is this to be expected with oral hrt, or is it cause for concern?  I tend to do light social drinking ever weekend or 2, so I don't know if that could be a factor either.. I plan to stop though. I assume this could also be helped by switching to injection or patches?

2) My cholesterol levels all came back in the borderline  high range... I assume this is because I have been eating like crap since having to move out from my wife. I'll probably get spoken to about my diet but I don't expect a huge problem here. 

3) My T level is at 367 with an expected range of 300-1080. I am hoping I will get my spiro dose increased. It was ~750 when I started so it's about half now.

4) And finally the big one. My Estrogen, total, serum is currently through the roof at 679.2 with a reference range of 60-190. Is that scary high, or is it ok?

Thanks for any responses, and I totally know talking to my doctor is the thing to do here, but I am going to stress about this like crazy until the appointment lol."

georgemitch,asktransgender,[huge breakthrough] My mum finally understands I am her daughter.,"I had another very long talk with my mum. I explained again and she finally got it. She finally knew I am not her son with a crossdressing fetish. She understood I am her daughter. 

------

I went back home looking very depressed again. I shouted at my mum then I cried. I told my mum to help me make another appointment with my psychiatrist, because I think I need to get a letter to drop a course at school after all. She made an appointment, then I kept crying. She was very worried about me. I told her a bit about the stress I am feeling at school, then I calmed down afterwards.

Fast forward to tonight. I got depressed again. I went to bed very early and curled myself up in my blanket. My mum came in and sat beside me. She asked me what was wrong. She said I seemed to have been getting more and more depressed since last month. At first I refused to talk, because I told her she wouldn't understand. She just kept sitting beside my bed and neither of us said anything. Then after almost an hour of silence I told her I was very angry and sad. I told her I had done a lot for her, more than she could imagine, but she didn't understand how much I loved her. She asked why. Then I refused to talk again. She didn't say anything.

Then after about half an hour she broke the silence and told me she had been feeling physically unwell. I was surprised and I turned to look at her immediately. I asked her what happened. She told me since she found out the clothes I was hiding in my bag more than two years ago, she had been feeling very scared and confused. 

She confronted me at that time, I explained to her but she didn't understand what I meant. She believed I was a pervert, and we never talked about it again after that day. Then a few months ago she checked my phone and found out the websites I was browsing and my selfies. She completely freaked out and confronted me again. I tried my best to explain to her again, but she still didn't get it. She still thought I was a fetishist. 

So at my bedside today my mum told me she was feeling unwell, I got very concerned because the last thing I want to see is my mum feeling unhappy. I love my mum very much. So I asked her to tell me about her worries. She said she didn't understand why I had to ""pretend to be a woman"", she was very scared and confused, but at the same time she could see that I was depressed every day. She said she was afraid to ask me questions because she was scared I would get mad at her.


So I decided to explain again. We had a talk that lasted for almost 3 hours, she finally understood what I meant. She was very shocked. She apologised to me for thinking I was a pervert in the past two years. I told her it was ok, I never really blamed her. She told me she felt very sorry that she had treated me badly in the past, and she told me she could finally start to see why I had been so depressed. I told her to stop apologising, and reassured her I was fine, because I had gotten used to the pain already. Then she told me, ""son, I am sorry. "" I nodded. I knew she wasn't aware what she said was quite hurtful to me. Then we sat in silence for a while then I finally told her, ""please call me by my name, I don't like being called son"". I explained and she realised what I was trying to say. She said, ""daughter... I am sorry"". Then she hugged me.

I was taken by surprise and I told her ""no no no you don't have to call me like this, just call me by my name, I don't want you to feel uncomfortable"". She didn't reply but we hugged for another few minutes. She was too tired after the long talk and fell asleep.

JaguarPunk,asktransgender,A thread for my mother! Please post your stories for her to read if you feel comfortable.,"Hello again everyone! I went to gender therapy on Monday and my therapist agrees that I am trans. I am getting an appointment to start HRT and I am very excited! However I wanted to start this thread for my mother, she is having a difficult time understanding what it means to be trans and that not all experiences have huge signs throughout life. I intend on linking this thread to her so she can read it in the hopes that seeing other people who had a similar experience might help her accept that this isn't just a phase or totally out of the blue. It took me 22 years to realize that I identify as female, I never had the huge signs of dysphoria as a kid instead just being extremely low mood, lost and struggling with self identity for pretty much my whole life up to now. She worries that since I didn't show the typical childhood signs that I am just attaching myself to this in hopes that I can finally have some sort of identity. I know why she thinks this way and I also know that she is going through a grieving process. I just hope that this may help her accept who I am and that I am genuinely trans! So please if anyone feels comfortable with it, share away! Thanks everyone who has taken the time to reply!

You are all wonderful and I wish you all the best. Your responses have really helped my mother and she wants to thank you all as well! Keep being awesome everyone! You are all the best.

TransGalacticOzone,asktransgender,Musings on social self rejection.,"​
Hey all, doing a little CBT in my head, seeing if I connect with anyone over this.

Something I've been toying with very recently about rejection, or in my case self rejection. Do you know that stereotype of ""oh no I don't want to be seen with that person""? Can that happen in reverse? I just feel like, I can't upkeep friendships because after I've ""met"" a person, I will avoid interacting with them, if I see them out in the hallway for example, or if they walk by my desk. I think deep down, I don't want anyone to be seen with me, or be seen by anyone. Like the feeling that comes up whenever I run into someone I recognize is ""embarassed"". What is that? Does anyone else identify with that feeling? I have felt and done this my whole life and I finally am linking this to dysphoria."
shaketheground,asktransgender,Question regarding logistics of testicular stabilization when tucking,"Hi! First off, my apologies if this is something that gets asked a lot. I'm in between classes and just had the idea to post so I don't feel like I have the time to try to navigate reddit's search function. I’m AMAB genderqueer and have recently started to try out tucking. I’m bad at learning how to do things that require fine motor skills if I don’t have someone demonstrating for me in person, but I’ve managed to figure out how to get everything where it’s supposed to go. I’m using homemade gaffes made of the top half of a tube sock and an elastic band from an old pair of boxers. However, I am having trouble getting my testicles to stay in the inguinal canals once I have the gaffe on. I’ve tried using compression shorts and panties to try to keep things tight, but they still end up moving back down which can become painful by the end of the day. Are there other materials that I need to try to keep things in place, such as spandex or control-top tights/panties? Am I incorrect in assuming that my testicles are supposed to stay where I’m putting them? 

Thanks in advance for whatever advice y’all might have to offer!"
askingforfriendnot,asktransgender,More questioning - dysphoria? Or what?,"Hi all I posted a thread yesterday but it didn't get many views. I hope this one gets some more opinions from you lovely people. Here we go. Story time...

I'm a cis male. Straight. 24 yo. Never been attracted to men but I know a good looking dude when I see one. I still like women sexually, just never been good with them.

I've been questioning the last 48 hours a lot. I was playing Overwatch and thought ""I'd like to look like Tracer."" I never really thought about my own gender before this. I don't hate being male but don't love it either. It just is. 

I never wore women's clothing or thought I was a girl as a kid. But I've always been different than my brothers. When playing soccer as a kid, my Dad would joke I spent more time sitting around picking at the grass and flowers than kicking the ball. I never played sports after my parents stopped signing me up as a young kid.

In puberty I had a bad time. I was bullied a lot and had some shoulder length hair until I eventually cut it. I read anime and watched shows like Cowboy Bebop, where I empathized with both male and female characters.

It was in puberty, around 15, I started roleplaying online video games. My first hardcore RP character was a red head woman. I didn't tell people I was male IRL for a long while. I liked the attention being a in-game girl brought me. She was straight and my character even started dating another male character. It felt weird at first to roleplay a woman but over time playing her became normal. I would run home after school to escape into my red head's dystopian fantasy world until bed. This lasted until I was almost 18.

I stopped roleplaying for a few years then picked it up again around 21. Again, I started roleplaying women. Most of them were either tomboyish, or brutes (one was a berserker in FFXIV), or just normal, intelligent women. Sometimes I roleplayed merchant women, or mages or just girl mercenaries. I did roleplay some dudes, but they always ended up as fantasy clones of myself and I soon would go back to playing my female characters. To this day, most of my characters are women with a couple exceptions.

I also love in MMOs where you can dress up your character. I literally spend hours picking out the best clothing/armor for my girls, making the colors match, all that stuff. I post screenshots of them all the time. Black Desert is amazing to me for its deep customization. I've spent lots of time tweaking my girls, buying cash shop outfits for them and roleplaying as them.

However, I've been kind of weird, almost hostile with trans people in my head. When a couple people I knew came out, I got weird around them. It just feels weird, almost unnatural...I don't know how to describe my feelings properly.

What do yo guys and gals think? Is this gender dysphoria or something else?

TL;DR

Roleplay a lot of women in games. Never wore women's clothing. No gender dysphoria as a child that I can remember. Always was bullied in school for liking things like anime, being a general nerd. Clinical depression and anxiety I'm taking mess for. Someone I thought was straight as an arrow came out trans, and now I've been wondering myself last couple days."
ShannonTheWereTrans,asktransgender,"I came out to my parents, gaslighting ensued","This is just a vent, there's no question at the end. I'm a 23 year old girl living on her own, and I've been self sufficient for quite some time (for context).

My little sister screwed me over, but she technically didn't out me. She told my parents that they needed to talk with me, they pushed hard for me to open up. I decided to rip off the band-aid and meet them at a restaurant in their city. That didn't go so well, they demanded to talk to me in their own home. On their turf. But I was feeling super girly and all kinds of confident in my gender, so I went anyway.

I came out by trying to deliver it like it was good news (because to me it is), but I couldn't even get a sentence out before the attacks started. It was all the usual stuff, ""you're running away from yourself,"" ""you're taking the easy way out,"" ""why can't you just accept yourself."" Then the gaslighting started. ""You told me you felt X, now you're telling me you feel Y."" ""Don't trust your feelings. I told you that when you went to high school, didn't I?"" ""You should talk to another counselor, one who won't just tell you what you want to hear."" ""Your friends don't like you, if they did they'd tell you that you're hurting yourself.""

They told me not to come back to the house until I was ready to be a man. They won't let me around my grandma because they ""can't handle her crying"" over me. They told me no matter what I'd never be a woman, that they'd never call me Shannon, and that they'd only refer to me as their son.

I feel like an orphan now. I don't know if my little sister will ever talk to me again. I won't have Christmas or birthdays or Thanksgiving. I won't have support if I lose my job or my apartment. My entire family was effectively cut off. But thankfully I have great friends who let me crash on their couch, cry in their arms, and drink their booze (Yamazaki 12 year goes great with tears).

It scares me to think my parents have always been so manipulative and abusive. But they've only done what they always do, try to whip me back in line. I won't be their precious little altar boy. Part of me is happy to be rid of them, another part hurts.

Just once I'd like to be the friend to come to a new appreciation for her family after listening to others bitch about theirs."
nicolemurphh,asktransgender,"Question from a straight, cisgender woman","Is it rude to ask a someone's gender? "
Mikaela_,asktransgender,Just wondering if people relate to these thoughts! (Probably),"I'll probably regrettably delete this in the morning like I always do because I'm such a coward, but I'm wondering if any of you share these thoughts!


1. I'm thinking recently that this has to do with my romantic life, I'm 18 now so not too old, I've had 2 loves so far but never any relationships, ever.
The first one I was really madly in love with, and it's left me very desperate for a relationship of any kind, and I'm scared that either being transgender is a product of this (thinking girls might have an easier time, subconsciously, or something which I know isn't true) or that it'll ruin my chances for ever.


2. Being a Guy sucks, but at the same time I think guys have it easier... I don't know what to think of this.
I look okay as a guy, not too great but not bad either, I'd say maybe a 5 ish. I see myself way worse but that's just dysphoria for you.


3. Ever since coming out to myself my self confidence mentally sky rocketed, but physically plummeted all the way down to rock bottom.


4. I'm not really into girly things, and I really detest anything masculine, however don't really feel dysphoria towards my genitals. I'm starting to feel like I might be non-binary, somewhere in the middle but leaning more on female, I never understood the whole non-binary thing but i don't know.


5. I'm really cowardly of coming out to my parents. It's the only logical next step for me at the moment but I always feel like I'll be denied by mom, or she'll just look at me like a freak and just think it's me being autistic like always.


Idk this post doesn't make any sense now that I'm here, but I'm tired and I guess I'll post it anyway.

mrlanon,asktransgender,Confusing sex drive.,"So pre-AA's I pretty much had to resort to masturbating everyday. Now since I started cyproterone on 12.5mg this went down. On 25mg it went even further down. Now the bizarre things thing is that after a few day overall arousal goes up again. It's starts subtle, but when it builds up it's strong. Now I have far more control over it overall, but does anyone else have that? I mean I know the cypro is working as the liquid is clear and barely non-existent.


I am also hopefully this coming week going on E. Would this change anything?

I currently can't run any bloodtests(will soon), but based on the fact on how long it takes and how I have to actively provoke it(I don't get a boner unless I really put it in mind, even then it goes away swiftly).

You'd think people in the LGBT community would have more tact. I'd have been happy to accept if she'd simply said that she wasn't into pre-op transwomen but she didn't like penises, but to deliberately invalidate my identity felt terrible.

Sometimes it really feels like I have to choose between me and my gender identity or any possible future relationship. The hetro women aren't interested and neither are the gay ones. Aarrgh.

Kenna193,asktransgender,"Is it an unpopular opinion among trans ppl that there may be an environmental cause, something like extra/weird hormones during gestation?","I know this is probably a slippery slope into zone terf and other bs. But I think it's worth asking. I think this is different from the nature v nurture argument tho.

Like maybe it's still just my own perception of feeling broken or messed up. But I think sometimes it's comforting to think this wasn't destiny, and that it's a mistake, like lead or extra hormones in the drinking water, or some other obscure and unproveable influence. It seems intuitively unlikely that this is just a thing that's always happened and will always be a % of the population. If it were a recessive gene wouldn't it have been selected out of the gene pool by now?

I don't think there is enough science to answer this question yet. But I'd be interested to hear if there is. I feel like what I'm getting at is, ""what causes trans ppl to exist.""

N7ComShep,asktransgender,How to approach points of a conversation,"So, I'm a passing trans man who works with customers. Most of my customers are very much okay with me, as I'm masculine and like I said, I pass. Some people don't even know I'm trans. A few of my customers however, strongly react to non passing trans people, particularly trans women. (I wondered if he just had a negative reaction to trans women, because he said some nasty things about a trans women who comes in who is very much not passing but I showed him Kat Blaque and he had zero problem with her and said she was actually cute.)

WynneN,asktransgender,Having some trouble with cold feet,"Hello all...I'm kind of at a standstill and could use a pep talk....

I'm a 55 y/o MTF who like so many in my age groups just didn't think transition was a possibility 30 some years ago. After failed relationships, not great behavior,  knowing deep down what this issue was but afraid to face it etc, I finally came to grips with who and what I am about a year and a half ago and after some time in therapy I was able to start HRT one year ago. 

My progress has been reasonably good (I have some pics posted in other subs), at my age and height I have realistic expectations of passing. Also because I am entrenched in the business sector the idea of being stealth is impossible.

I'm lucky to be  financially secure and in a leadership role at our company. I also have a high profile position in a well known charitable organization. It is important for me to look as professional and appropriate as possible so I have worked with someone who has been helping me assemble the proper wardrobe. 

My name change order has already been done, and the next step is to change my drivers license and SSN. Once I do that, I will have to notify HR. It is at that point where I would communicate to the managers and employees what is going on, likely take a  week off and return as the new me. This is where I'm stuck right now and I'm frozen.  

Every other step I've made in this journey has progressed one after the other, and I'm sure this one is not because this is the one with all the finality. The family and friends who know are supportive, but I am very concerned about the professional environment. Our team here, our vendor partners and our clients.

I do realize how lucky I am in so many respects with some of the advantages I have, but yer here I am . If anyone has any insight or thoughts to share I would be most appreciative."

I live in Bc, Canada and it's pretty populace here. I go to uni full time and I have a job part time at Walmart.  Which, at least in Canada, just updated harassment policies for transgendered. I also have to update all my personal files and I am unsure how to go about doing that.

My big problem is many of my friends and most of my family know I'm trans. But not sure how I go about telling Work/school. I kind of wanted to be on hrt for awhile and let the school know next year, but I am unsure if that's a viable option or not.

I am trying to buy more clothes and makeup in preparation for coming out but am a little lost for what to get.

Any tips for a struggling woman would be appreciated.

sawnico,asktransgender,fiancée's parents found out I'm trans,"Friends,

It's been a crazy few days: I came out to my mother on Sunday--she took it great--&amp; to my cousin (with her husband) on Monday. They took it well too, but I come from a small family &amp; forget sometimes other people who might react just as strongly. I thought I was out to everybody who should be told in person so I updated my gender, profile picture, &amp; name on Facebook. I forgot about fiancée's sister. 

Yesterday, we were having a nice Valentine's Day dinner at our favorite restaurant. Her sister called. My A. ignored the call. Then her dad called. She ignored it too. Then he called back again and she answered. 

Apparently he sounded like someone had died. She told she'd call back later, was going to wait until tonight. He called at 7:00 a.m. said something along the lines of ""we've tried to be understanding about his [sic] behavior for years"" &amp; ""I just don't get it"" over and over again.

I've never been too close with her parents. They are through-and-through mid-western WASPs, uneducated, but lovely lovely people. I'm a poet (poor, predictably) from the South West. Regardless our differences they always accepted me into their house, and supported their daughter for being with me. But now I'm worried that I've ruined her life. I knew that if this moment ever came it would either be a final cut to their relationship or require a miracle.

&amp; reddit, I don't know what to do. Any Ideas? Any at all?

TLDR: after my fiancée's parents found out I'm trans, I'm worried I've ruined her family life.

I was previously told to see a doctor about my problems, which, although I haven't done yet, I intend to in the next two to three months.

Another thing is that, when I am a woman, I *really* want to undergo surgery and HRT to make me sound less manly (I have a solid, deep bass voice at the moment), but me as a male has mixed feelings, which is even more confusing than the first time I posted.

I want as much of a detailed explanation as possible for what's going on, and at the moment, I think I can only talk about this here. So any advice would go along way!"

I asked his opinion on a few things, tattoos (no issues, yay), and HRT, which he was very straightforward about, saying that female hormones would increase my already high risks for stroke and heart attack, and really aren't a good idea. He was surprizingly unfazed by my asking, when he asked ""why?"" To my vague question of Hormone Replacement Therapy, I locked up and my wife answered for me ""gender identity"", which he seem to totally understand, and asked me if I was considering a gender change, which I said yes to.

I was pretty sure I was gonna get that answer, but actually hearing it has really really messed me up, I'm feeling loss, and sadness. I had no idea how much I was hoping to go on HRT.

What can I do now? I can't medically transition, top surgery is too expensive, and frankly, way out of the question for now. So is laser, and electrolysis. Being on disability means I have very little free money to spend.

Edit:
This is the doc that's keeping my terminal bone marrow disease from killing me. He didn't seem put off by the notion, but was clear that I'm already at high risk, and this would really make things worse. Considering I'm at 13yrs since diagnosis, and I was given 20, then 7-10, I'd rather not shorten that estimate, or risk stroking out and being a vegetable. I trust this doctor implicitly."
zauraz,asktransgender,Potential 'handsomeness'? Not trans? [Rant/Vent],"I am an 80% sure MtF. Recently I have noticed more and more that I can find my appearance to be more 'handsome' and attractive when having certain hairstyles etc. This is something that frightens me. Before I had an selfhatred for my appearance that I admitted to myself but seeing this 'potential' good looks in a body I never liked and in a gender I don't think I am makes me question if I really am trans or just hated my body all this time?

Lately I have wished for nothing more than to be cis. To stop feeling different. To like my dad would have said ""accept myself"". But at the same time I am not ready to give up the idea of being trans but at the same time it feels like it would be such a relief to just 'live like everyone' else. I realize that this won't work however as I am too obsessed thinking about this to ever stop.

It feels like I am lying to everyone around me and I can't do anything to make them see 'me'. My parents see a future for me that I can't see and although they are 'accepting' they have expectations of grandchildren etc that I don't know if I can live up to like this.

I am an introvert and with schoolwork I rarely socialize and I don't want to party/get drunk like most of my surrounding age group. Most of my days are spent feeling melancholical, doing homework, watch a series with my parents and go to bed....

I never do anything and I lack the energy for it now and its killing me. I will take a year off from school but with the pressure of studying more I question why I should not continue directly but I would not survive that.

I am tired. After my healthcare lied to me about having sent my referal to gender therapy I felt hopeless and I don't have money for consent clinics or independent treatment if I wanted that. For every passing day there is less possibility to alter my body and I have to make the choice soon. 

Every moment of every day is obsesseing about being trans whenever I am not studying. I still feel a great sense of melancholy seeing women and a desire to be able to appear like them. I am also jealous of some of the things women are normatively allowed that men are not. Yet I don't feel that I deserve to be a girl... I am constantly reminded by my surroundings indirectly that gender is some sort of absolute. No one says it but everyone takes it for granted and it hurts to know that I can't do that but I wish I could.

Almost everyone in my class at school is a girl. I am always reminded of what I am and aren't...


I feel like a stupid selfish burden to the people around me, only obsessed with my own shitty problems that doesn't seem to matter at all in any form to reality. Maybe it does to me but it really seems to not matter in any form to anyone else which makes me question if it does...

I am tired, stressed out, sad, frustrated. I lack the energy for all this right now and I can't do anything about anything... I don't have anyone in person to talk to, although I have a great friend through an online chat.. It all feels like a pain right now..

For the record I see a therapist and we will meet soon but I have lost some trust in her..

Sorry for this thing/post/rant I just wanted to try and get some of my feelings out, please comment what you think.. If you dislike it or downvote, please tell me why..

Thanks for reading..

aurakitea,asktransgender,Fear of Invalidating Myself,"I've come to a decision. I'm transgender. There's no way that a cisgender person would get the kind of comfort and hope that I do when I think of myself transitioning. So I'm trying to keep that firmly in my mind when the doubt hits. 

That said, I've lived 28 years of my life presenting and mostly identifying as male while desperately wanting to be female. I get scared a lot, because I still feel like I have to 'catch' myself to not misgender myself. For instance, I'll often come close to saying ""I'm one of those guys who..."" and I have to make a conscious effort to stop myself from referring to myself by a male pronoun. In conversations right now, I generally use gender neutral pronouns in person and female pronouns in anonymous online settings.

Is this common for people who question and/or transition later? I just feel like every time I 'almost' slip up I'm not trans enough, that maybe on some level I'm cisgender when I don't want to be. The emotions that I feel when I feel like I might be cisgender are distressing to say the least, and often lead me to suicidal thoughts. 

I guess I just need to know that I'm not alone here. "

Fauxy-Voxy,asktransgender,Trans Women/men of Color &amp; community Paticipation,"I was wondering if there is a silent minority of trans-people of color like myself endlessly lurking online. And what I mean by people of color is  people who CAN NOT PASS AS WHITE. I really dont wanna come of as rude and I truely apologize if I do. It's just very important to differentiate between people who can and cannot pass as white because the way you are treated especially as a trans-person, in North America at least,  is literally WORLDS apart.  Being a Afro-Latina early in her transition and working in a identity sensitve job I Usually  lurk shamelessly lol However, after months of going through  r/transgender  r/asktransgender  r/transpassing,   r/transtimeline ect....I began to notice subjects and depictions around trans people of color only came up when it revolved around being murdered or was simply non-existent. I tried tumblr communities to no avail and any information that does surface there around trans people of color is usually depicted in a extremely pornographic/fetishized way or the narrative is around oppression/extreme violence. By no means am I upset at the majority of white or white passing people who are here; all of my irl friends from birth till now have been or are white which is why this is very important to me. Overall, I would desperately love
 to hear your thoughts on minority participation  in online trans communities. What are your thoughts and feelings about it? along with any complaints? suggestions of improvement?

tgkiwi70,asktransgender,Physically Feeling Emotions,"In the past week or so I've started to experience something new. I physically feel emotions in a way that I never did pre-HRT.

I obviously used to have a physical reaction to things like fear or disgust (the reactions that I guess we have primarily to help us to react quickly to danger), but now I'm experiencing something similar for subtler emotions too.

For example if something happens that makes me happy or sad, I now feel that emotion sort of wash over my body. Sorry, it's very difficult to articulate because it is so unlike how I felt before.

I mentioned it to a cis-female friend and she was stunned that men don't experience that because she said that she always had.

DrSoandSo13,asktransgender,The posts on this sub remind me that I'm not alone :),"Hi! I have been reading posts on here recently and it's been really helpful for me. I thought I might share my experiences on here so that maybe other people might be able to relate in the same way that I've related to some of you. 

I figured out I was genderqueer a a couple years ago, but I only just figured out that I was trans last summer. The time in between these two events was spent in denial about it, and I took on the identity of bigendered because it meant I could still pass as a guy while also acknowledging that I had a feminine side. I was scared to be trans because I didn't want to be rejected by people in my life, or to be hurt by people who didn't respect my personhood. I got over that when I realized how much happier I was identifying as a woman, and this process really helped my mental state. 

I never acted in such a way growing up that anyone expected that I was trans. Not that this is a condition that needs to be met, but my coming out totally threw off my parents, because they thought I was happy as a guy. This is because I never told them about the things I felt, like how much I liked women's clothes and painted nails, or my fascination with periods (that I was really embarrassed of most of my life), or the desire I had to be able to switch to a female body whenever I wanted. It seems weird to me now that I never put the pieces together.... But I had engrained into myself that I needed to be a man to be accepted, so I remained ignorant of what this stuff might have meant. I felt this way because, right around the time I hit puberty, I had some minor bullying experiences. These never happened again after middle school and had nothing to do with my gender (my friends and I were the ""nerds"" and got verbally harassed a little, but nothing more). But even though they were minor they totally trashed my self-esteem, and I went through a very dark period of my life during the next 5 years in which I convinced myself that if I wanted to be accepted by my peers I had to be masculine, including repressing my emotions, and that I had to do things to fit in with them, like dress in a ""cool"" way. I did that, but it didn't make me feel better. I felt alone and like I didn't fit in. Looking back, I was severely depressed, but I didn't know what being depressed was, so I thought it was normal to feel that way, and I never told anyone until college, at which point it got so bad that I started hurting myself and getting anxiety so bad I couldn't function. Part of why it was so bad was because when I felt sad I couldn't cry it out, because I had lost touch with my emotions from repression. 

I think this all has to do with my sensitivity to others' judgment and my repression of my emotions. I spent so many years caring about what other people thought and hating myself. As soon as I realized I was trans that went away. I almost immediately started to feel more confident and began to get in touch with my feelings. I still got anxious about going out in public with feminine aspects to my appearance, but luckily I live in Eugene, Oregon, which is super liberal and people here really don't care. Over time I have become so much happier. I am waiting for after graduation to transition (just a few more months!) and I know I will be happier still when I do that. I've gotten to a point where I do what makes me happy and don't care what anyone thinks. It took me a long time to get here. For the first time in my life I regularly look at myself in the mirror and love myself, even though I still have a male body (I get dysphoric sometimes but it isn't that bad compared to what I used to feel about myself, so I can deal). 

I'm lucky that my parents are progressive and so still love me despite me being trans. They are old (65-75 year old range), though, so they don't understand that many peoples' attitudes toward genderqueer people are different now, and that the language used regarding gender issues has changed. My dad, for instance, wanted me to wait until after medical school to transition (no way that I'm waiting 5+ years!) and said he thought that the hormones would interfere with my ability to do well in school (which seems sexist, but he very specifically referred to the large dose of female hormones that my body wasn't used to, not just female hormones in general, so idk), and he thought that no hospital would hire a trans doctor, so he got scared for my career goals. I'm pretty sure he's wrong about that, though (and anyways, nothing is gonna stop me from accomplishing my dream of working as a physician). My mom took it pretty hard at first because she had to cope with ""losing her son"", as she put it, and I guess that's understandable. But now she isn't acting bad about it, with occasional exceptions (for instance, telling me she didn't think I should get a ""fake voice""). Sometimes I get mad at them. But, like I said, I'm lucky I didn't get disowned or something like that. And I know I'm lucky to have accepting friends, too. I'm still relatively privileged. I wish that all of you could have that, as well. I get sad when I read about trans people who are rejected by others in their lives. 

I'm just rambling at this point, and I am sorry this has been so long! But it makes me feel good to see that other people have gone through some of the things I have gone through and I hope some of you can relate to my story. :) 

TLDR: coming out as trans has been a very positive experience for me and has helped me overcome years of mental illness and self-hatred, and, despite the challenges that still exist, I recognize that I am a very lucky person for that.

ImHereSoIDntGetFound,asktransgender,Feeling fake?,"I've recently gone full time and since I pass pretty well I'm pretty elated to be treated like a girl.  But it feels totally fake.

I have to wear a wig to pass so when I go to the gym I have to hide out in a bathroom stall to change so no one sees my man face.  When I go to the bathroom having to re-tuck and pee with a penis in the girls' room feels weird.  My voice passes well, but what if it slips up and drops for a second?  All of my IDs still have a name and photo that is blatantly masculine.  I haven't had any problems at all so far, but it all feels like I'm standing on a house of cards waiting to collapse at any minute and for people to think I'm a fraud.

hse97,asktransgender,What are your opinions on this YouTube video analyzing Swiss Army Man's (2016) protagonist's gender dysphoria?,"Okay, so Swiss Army Man is a dark comedy staring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. It's a bit of an absurd movie, and I had only seen a trailer of it until this video. But I was going through YouTube when I found a video essay on the main character, Hank, and how this movie  parallels the experience of having gender dysphoria and the experiences of being trans. 


I have a few issues with the essay, nothing malicious and I think Bobby was able to be really informative while staying respectful. I disliked the example of Hank's personality being very non-sexual when describing the girl in the magazine. My biggest gripe is that this is his first argument in the essay and it again conflates gender dysphoria and sexuality as being codependent on one another, and I that's not true. It certainly has affected my sexuality, but by using this as his foundation for evidence, I think it builds the case on the idea of sexuality being a byproduct of gender. 


Other than that I really enjoyed it and wanted to hear a few other people's thoughts on it.   "
HumbleSuperGod,asktransgender,"Super tall and masculine, but feminine in all other aspects. Can I take meds to transition but still present as male in public?","This is going to be very long and rambling, but I'm just now allowing myself to open up to the possibility that I am probably transgender. I'm 25, born male, and 6'5"" tall with big broad shoulders, long gangly legs, and a baritone voice. Despite being reminded every step of the way by others that I'm ""manly"" and ""should be playing basketball"", I've never once felt truly male. For example: 
* I've always felt super comfortable around other women
* I've never been able to understand the mindset of most men or really connect with men at all
* I've had my makeup done by girlfriends and felt beautiful and ""like myself"" every time
* I've tried on girls clothing and loved every second of it
* I always associate with female characters in movies/books
* I always played video games as female avatars
* Even though I'm semi-exclusively attracted to women, when I see other pretty girls I'm normally imagining *being* them, not seducing them or whatever
* I'm always a girl in my dreams
* And most notably I have been gaining weight this year in order to get a more feminine figure

So I never really made a connection between all that and potentially being transgender until just a few weeks ago. I was admiring my bigger boobs and thinking about how I wanted them way bigger, when I asked myself why I'd want that. Why do I want bigger hips? A big butt? To be around women and do girly things? To do my makeup every day and wear yoga pants and dresses? It sort of all came over me like a tidal wave and after the last few days of constant introspection, I've realized that I consider myself to be female. I've never once in my life been like ""yeah, I'm a man"" and there's a reason for that.

Saying all this, I consider myself to be way too tall and masculine to ever pass as a woman. It is a depressing thought, but I think I'd always feel self-conscious going out in public dressed like a woman, because my mental picture of myself as a woman is much shorter. I know of many tall mtf women who are confident enough to go through that all, but I don't think I could. As frustrating as this is, I do know my family would be okay with me presenting female in private. 

My main question is whether, after counseling and doctor's visits, I could potentially start on estradiol or related medications even fully knowing that the changes to my body would not be on public display. It would make me more confident to have the body that matches who I am in my heart, even if I continued to present as male at work and in public areas. 

Another question I have is whether my weight (280) would be an impediment to my transitioning. I know that the ""male fat"" I have would stick around unless I lost it, but fortunately my weight tends to settle in a feminine way (big boobs, pretty nice butt and hips, round face) and I actually have gynecomastia on top of it all. I enjoy being heavier, so if I started on estradiol and continued gaining weight, would that settle in more feminine areas?

Thank you for all your thoughts in advance. You are the first people I've discussed this with besides my sister so this is a big first step for me in becoming comfortable in who I am. :)"

But before I come out publicly (as in everyone who knows me knows, like through facebook and all that) I need to tell a few people specifically/in person first.

The biggest hurdle of these will be my biological father. He is a moderate left politically, but he also makes homophobic and even more so transaphobic comments commonly, always in that shitty ""oh well that was totally sarcasm; not serious!"" but he totally is he just also knows that its wrong. That along with his personality, I am expecting him to freak out/start an argument right off the bat about it. I will be coming out to him with my mom and dad with me (step-dad but I just drop the step because it feels shitty) and we already have a rough plan of how we'll/I'll handle it if he does freak, but I wanted to get any suggestions on good ways of handling people like this, or how you approach coming out to someone you suspect will reject you? Also as a side note, besides a lot of his shortcomings I still love my father so I want to try to get him to understand and I still want a relationship with him after, especially since he's financially well off so it would be great to have someone with that power on my side.

Also there are a number of other people I want to tell before I come out to everyone because they're important to me and I want to tell them personally. People like my sister, more close friends, etc. Do you have any suggestions of ways to come out to people that are important to you without either 1) over stressing about it, or 2) make it feel routine after you've told one or two of them.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I have ideas of my own, but it'd be nice to hear some experiences/suggestions from others. Thanks!"
kernalmustache,asktransgender,What happens if you forget to take your hormones a lot?,"For the past couple of weeks my sleep schedule has been completely fucked up and quite a few times I've forgotten to take my hormones for about 12 hours after I should have.

helloitslouis,asktransgender,Does anyone know of a good scale about attitude towards trans people (for a bachelor's degree)?,"My best friend (who's cis) is currently working on his bachelor's paper for which he, amongst other things, wants to make a survey about the attitude towards LGBT people. He found good scales for L+G, but not for trans people. He just found one scale that he dislikes because of the terms that are used (""transgenderism"" and ""transgendered"") and because it's biased as it only serves stereotypes (and it also claims trans people are cross-dressing).

He has to use a preexisting scale, it's in the university's guidelines.

He's using the ATLG-scale (attitude towards lesbians and gays) for the respective people and it's one option to remodel those questions to fit trans people but he'd rather use a good scale already fit for trans people obviously. 

Does anyone know of or has already worked with a good scale that measures the attitude towards trans people?

Thank you very much!

Teraxias,asktransgender,Potentially unusual about sex after hormones,"So I'm hoping to get started on HRT in the next few months to a year but I keep getting caught up on one thing....So I kinda have a big dick, and I like having it and using it. A lot. I'm more of a dom, and enjoy being a bit more masculine in the bedroom. I have a big dick that doesn't cause me any dysphoria and that has always been well approved of by the girls I sleep with, especially by my current s/o. I know HRT by and large shrinks you down pretty small and makes it next to impossible to keep an erection. is there a way around this? I know like a lot of us I first discovered trans people through porn, and ever since starting my journey I've wondered a lot about how trans pornstars so often still have massive cocks that dont appear to be prosthetic. I love the equipment i have, and love my sex life so this is kind of nagging in the back of my head. anybody have advice? "
5000klances,asktransgender,Small rant - why the hell do we have to do this?,"EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks for the responses. I will comment on some below.

Just a little rant. I am 47, I live in the midwest, and I have been on HRT for over 5 years continuously. I am part time I suppose, I present female regularly when going to a trans support group which for me has been a good experience. I'm told I pass OK, I occasionally boyfail when presenting male.

I have a girlfriend of 7 years who has known from pretty much the start. She and I get into these... I won't call them fights, more like emotionally charged discussions. We love each other and both want to stay together. However, she didn't think, and I don't even think I did either, it would ever get to the point where I was seriously considering coming out.

She says she doesn't want the social cost, she is afraid of being perceived as lesbian, and she doesn't understand why it can't just be a personal thing. ""Why do you need to come out?"" she asks. ""Why not just be OK with simply knowing you're trans? Does it have to be full time or nothing? Is it important that the world knows you're this way?""

I have a hard time responding to this. I think she has a point. I mean, you meet a person who is say, Jewish, and unless they're wearing a yarmulke, the first thing out of their mouth is not ""Hi I'm so-and-so and I am Jewish.""

Best response I can think of is yes, I know I am trans, but knowing this and just being content with hormones is somehow not enough. I like to present female. We transition, I think in part, because the world relates differently to our gender. Culturally speaking, some things are denied to me, and some things are expected of me, because of my gender. If I cross certain cultural boundaries, I am considered deviant... i.e. ""Guys don't wear nail polish!""

Additionally, my life is starting to become compartmentalized. I now have a group of trans women my age who I am getting to be pretty good friends with. While we all participate in different social circles, it is stressful to have to keep certain social circles completely isolated from each other. I can't share stories, for example.

I don't know. What do you all think?

tl;dr

Girlfriend wonders why it is necessary for me to come out."

becoming_madeline,asktransgender,Full time,"Cross posted to r/translater

It's a reality check for me, my wife told me I've been living full time for a while now.  Now I understand that this doesn't fit everyone's paradigm of gender but it does ours.

I cook, I clean, I do laundry, I homeschooling our kids, I don't have time to shave my legs, do my eyebrows or put on make up.  I wear sweatpants and a t-shirt and keep my hair short because it is easier.  My wife works, and I raise the kids.  This plays into stereotypical gender roles and it's reversal, but again it's our reality.

I may not be on HRT yet, March 3rd, Yay!  I don't have boobs other than my ""moobs"" and even though I shave daily now I still have some hair on my chin like other women.

Yes, I want to look the part I am living, but I am happy with the journey right now.  So, when it comes time I want them to recognize that my full time year is now!  I am out to those who are important to me, my name is Lilly, I don't have my gender markers changed yet do to important reasons, I am a woman.

Now to my questions, I have physical therapy twice a week for a shoulder injury, should I start on a low dose at the start?  It might get weird if I start getting boobs while in physical therapy.  Second, if you have been living full time when do they consider your time starting? And who says I have to be ultra feminine to be considered full time?

Thanks, I know I'm rambling again....

so yeah, what's the uh, ""proper way"" of telling them? are there any specific things i could say to them? i should mention that i'm doing this again because i'm on therapy right now, and with my therapist we're working out all things related to me being trans. and he told me that it would be a good idea to write a letter or a ""speech"" that included what i wanna say to my parents. speaking of, would it be better if i discuss with my therapist the idea of bringing my parents in someday and telling them there? or is it better to do it somewhere else?

thegreenhundred,asktransgender,Picked a name! Not sure which spelling to use.,"Wife and I disagree on spelling.... So options for first and middle are:

A. Kathryn Avery

B. Katherine Avery 

The predominant historical roots of both first and middle names tie very well into my last name and aesthetically predictable ethnicity so I am excited about that.

The worry that inspired our disagreement is that one of the spellings may not be as equally appreciated in professional settings. Especially for job application, resume, and recruiting purposes. Since the cards are already stacked against me professionally after transition being female and trans in a highly technical and misogynist field. 

She wants me to play it safe with the spelling but I am just too attached to my preference on spelling and so so so ambivalent about the alternative.

So, I am 25 years old male, I still identify and present as one, but don't know if I am one.  Sorry if this offends someone but I don't want to become transgender woman, I just don't feel enough of a man so this feeling brought me here. This gender question popped in my head one night and now I can't shake it of until I am sure in one or another. The thing is when I started questioning I got extremly depressed but not because I figured out I am woman and I have male body but the fact that I realised I might be one got me depressed. I am not sure but I think I have disphoria common for MTF'S where I don't like my wide hips, when I see my body it (in my eyes) looks like womans and I don't like it, I allways wanted bigger penis and like my beard and body hear, I don't know if I have any dysphoria common for  MTF'S. Last night I put on some nail polish and could feel unease that FTM guys describe I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers of when I saw them coloured. Yet on the other hand I don't feel like a man, like I am so insecure and even if I don't have any rational reason to be (6foot4, 94kg, handsome).  I was closeted gay for very long time and I used to have a lot of girlfriends, but when I started seing other man I started questioning my gender. For the first 3 months I got totaly confused I still am but for the last few days I got some kind of self confidence about being man I am, yet this feeling I might be woman doest go away totaly. I am on antidepressants and I am not sure if they have lesened dysphoria or made me think more clearly but  since the questioning is still there I am even more confused because they have huge impact on my emotions and my mind and now I am afraid to get off of them becouse I don't know if dysphoria will get worse. I never once in my life wanted to be a woman, sometimes it  seems to me that I would rather have my penis cut off just becouse I think it's small so I don't have to think about it any more rather than to actually wanting to have vagina.

Queen_Kit,asktransgender,[NSFW?] Am I a transphobic trans-woman?,"I've seen a lot of debate on whether or not it is transphobic for cisgender/cissexual people to lack feeling of sexual attraction to trans people that have the genitalia of their preference. I haven't seen anything about trans people not attracted to other trans people though.

Hopefully people don't hate me and dislike me to death, but I am a transsexual woman who is only attracted to cissexual/cisgender women. For reasons that I do not understand or really know, I am not attracted to transgender/transsexual women. Even after they undergo years of HRT and bottom surgery, I don't transsexual women to be sexually enticing. 

I've been told that the reason I am this is way is because I have internalized transphobia. I don't know, maybe I do? I've been raised in a cisgender/cissexual society and I was taught to perceive the world in that way from a young age. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite hoping that I will one day find a cisgender/cissexual woman who will be able to love me despite the fact that I'm trans, all the while I just can't bring myself to date transsexual women. The irony is that I would probably have far better chances of finding a partner if I _were_ sexually attracted to transgender/transsexual women. I've had crushes on them no doubt, I've had crushes on boys too, and some trans-men, but when sex comes into play I just don't feel attracted. Am I transphobic? Do I have some sort of internalized transphobia? Am I an oddity or are there others who have the same problem?"

My oestrogen in the blood test was 615 pmol/L, testosterone was 10 nmol/L.

They've said the oestrogen is above the target range. I'm happy, but I don't know if that's a bad thing as far as they're concerned i.e. things aren't happening as expected and they might want to adjust dosage.

The letter was very brief indeed, saying nothing else at all. He'd previously said he'd need to see me at 6 months, so this is sooner than expected.

This is ok right? I'm hoping it'll just be a meeting for me to start on something to get my T suppressed, but the urgency of it surprised me. They got back to me sooner than ever before, and they didn't say anything about appointments this early on.

I'm not sure if it's good news or bad news :P I've sent them a message to organise the appointment but they're usually slow to reply.

Anyone been in a similar situation?"

heyymann,asktransgender,I'm bi-gender?? A crossdresser? Someone help.,"Hey guys, I'm a long time reader first time poster. I'm just looking for some advice so I feel more at peace with what's going on. Sorry if formatting sucks I'm on a phone.

So I recently kinda came out to my close friends and family as mtf trans. Everyone was super accepting and overall it was good to come clean and feel more honest with the people I love. The only issue I have is.. I'm not sure if I'm totally transgender. 

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm not cis. Since around 10 I have been cross dressing.. experimenting with make up, and just feeling overall pretty feminine. I get dysphoric at times when in boy clothes, but it seems to come and go depending on the day, my mood, and a ton of other factors. I'm now 19, soon 20, and I frequently cross dress. I do it whenever I can and I feel comfortable with who I'm around. For example, I'm in girl clothes right now hanging out with my sister who is very supportive. 

I love crossdressing. (Especially makeup god damn is that shit amazing) I love looking and feeling like a girl. I honestly feel like if it was an ideal world, I would dress like this 24/7. But when it comes to my work (live sound  engineering and other various pretty male-centric jobs) that feeling tends to kinda go away.. I don't feel the need to be femme all the time but if I could wake up tomorrow with a new ID, a new wardrobe, and a vagina, I would. 

I'm frustrated right now because I just moved to a new town and I've got a lot of other things going on in my life that really make me feel as if I can begin a transition.. 

Part of why this frustrates me so much is i feel like I missed out on a lot by waiting until I was 19 to tell all my friends I don't want to be a boy anymore.. most of my masculine features are fully developed by now.. I feel like if I'm honest with myself I am bi-gendered, but like.. I want the hormones, I want the make-up, hell one day I might even want the SRS. But it seems almost like I don't want it bad enough to endure the struggle required to make all that happen. And that makes me feel very guilty and confused. Like I made a mistake by coming out to that handful of people.

If you read all that you're a trooper. I know it was kind of all over the place. I just needed somewhere to kinda, get it all out.

Any comments or advice is welcome."
desperate_and_weird,asktransgender,I'm from France and wondering where to look and what to do (MtF),"Hey! It's me again, thanks a lot for all your answers last time, it helped me get rid of the few doubts I had left. I'd really like to start working on all of that asap, but unfortunately me and doctor are kinda clueless about where to start. Is anyone else from France? Do you guys know a few names, and perhaps more importantly, how long it'd take to start the treatment?

I might be repeating myself a bit from my last thread, but I've been knee-deep in depression for at least 8 years now, and I really don't have much left in me. I really hope I don't have to wait like a year to start, you know... Living. The thing is, I don't have any friends in real life at all, I don't go to school anymore (dropped out due to depression becoming too extreme), and I don't have a job. The only people I talk to think I'm a girl, but as it stands, I can't quite meet them yet, and I don't want them to know I'm trans. I'd feel very uncomfortable with them knowing I'm in transition, and still looking like a guy. At the moment I'm just stuck at home, everyone I know online wants to meet me, but I have to keep saying no, and it's tearing me apart.

If it really takes a while to start the treatment, does anyone know if it's possible for me to just disguise myself in the meantime? I can do the voice, and I don't look too masculine afaik, but it's not enough. My hair is long but not straight enough, my eyebrows are too thick, and I can't quite hide my beard either... Maybe there are some beauty experts I could see, I don't know, or at least some good tips.

Note that my parents still don't know I'm trans, I still don't feel confident in telling them..."

L051ngMy3dg3,asktransgender,How do you guys deal with going through difficult stuff in the long term?,"Sorry if the title is weird, i'll explain. So over the recent months some [bad shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5elcoc/feeling_defeated_dont_know_what_to_do_nsfw/) - NSFW - happened to me, along with an experience of coming out to my dad that had us getting into a huge fight with him saying he might cut me off because he doesn't feel right giving me any financial help if i'm buying hormones. So, generally, I've been pretty depressed, as i basically chronically have since high school. Then last night i had this dream, that (since i have no trans friends irl) I couldn't really fully explain the significance of to anyone. 

I dreamed that I somehow stumbled upon the ability to restart my life from the beginning of high school again, this time picking the gender I was born as. It seems like an unrealistic thing in waking, but it felt SO REAL in the dream, and it made me so happy. I looked in the mirror and I was just clearly female and passing, and I felt all the pain and horrible things I dealt with over the last 6 years melting away. Then I woke up, and cried. And skipped all of my classes for 2 days.  

And the main reason is this: I can't imagine how different things could have been for me psychologically if I wasn't being so brutally repressed for my whole adolescence (and life in general). I went to an all boys catholic high school and got called a faggot for wanting to be in the musicals or hang out platonically with my female friends from elementary school. I suppressed all my emotions and attractions for 4 years and it almost killed me. And ever since then I always told myself that making it through this pain made me a stronger, better person. That it was all worth something. But that dream just made me realize that all it really made me was sad, and traumatized. 

So yeah. thoughts? How do you guys frame your experiences? I know a lot of trans people have been through way worse shit then me so I try not to be to self pitying. 

TL:DR; Had a dream that I could be cis, made me realize that fighting to deal with being trans has hurt me a lot in the long run. "
NewtonsApple42,asktransgender,Finally came out. Don't know where to start.,"So to start I've been a long-time lurker here and other similar subs and this is an alt account for obvious reasons. I'm a 28 y/o male and have recently (finally) come out to my current gf about my gender dysphoria. To preface, I've grown up with not-so-great body image issues. I can't say I've ever really felt comfortable in my own body. Didn't have very many friends and I didn't really become self-conscious until the later years of high-school.

The earliest I remember feeling different was probably middle school. When I'd look at beautiful women, my attraction was beyond sexual, and I'd often find myself wishing I had their lives and their bodies. I started exploring wearing girls clothing and make up soon after, and would often get a rush like everything felt *right.*

This would continue secretly through most of grade school. Near sophomore and junior year of high-school, I've about had it with my body-image, being overweight and unhealthy. I took it upon myself to get a gym membership and started taking care of myself. With this, and accompanied by research, I've felt that the gym and building muscle mass would make me feel more manly and masculine and for years I tried to suppress my dysphoria. Some days I'd feel like it were working, but others it would return, sometimes even stronger. My mind would often be in conflict, as I would try to convince myself that I *should* be male as my feelings of being female were simply abnormal and not right.

I come from a relatively conservative but extremely loosely-religious family, yet I've never had the courage to ever say anything to anyone, out of strong fear of rejection. However, every year that I get older, I feel like my time to possibly transition gets shorter.

For whatever reason, I've finally came clean with my gf. She's bisexual and has lots of friends and strong ties to the LGBT community and I've finally realized that if there was one person that might understand and be okay with who I am, it would be her. She's very accepting of it and offers to help in any way she can, however, I don't even know the questions to ask.

I feel that on one side, I can continue to try and suppress my dysphoria and never truly feel like myself but never have to worry about possibly alienating my friends and family. However, on the other side, I can pursue transitioning before it's too late. However, with that my fears not only consist of alienation, but I also fear that I wouldn't make an attractive/passable female and don't know what that would do to my body-image.

I've been ""out"" for about a week now, but now I feel as if it's so much more real. It feels that now someone knows, it's more than just a messed up thought in my head. I know it's a baby-step but it feels so damn good to finally get it off my chest.

I guess at this point, I'm simply looking for what to do next. If I decide to make the plunge and explore who I feel that I really am, where do I start?

TLDR;
I've finally come out to someone (my gf) which makes my suppressed feelings seem much more real. Now I'm looking for help on what to do next."
TransGalacticOzone,asktransgender,"Which first: HRT, or body hair removal?","Siblings,

I am pre-HRT, MtF, with light skin and dark hair. I've already had my first laser session for facial hair (yay!), and I'm beginning to plan out what to do about all my body hair. I'm not particularly hairy, but I do have dark hair on my legs and arms and genital area, etc.

My question is, I do know that HRT will change how my body hair grows. Should I begin HRT to see what changes happen before I worry about what method to go with for hair removal, or should I begin hair removal now so that I am that much more ahead in the transition process when I do start HRT?

Thank you :)"

taylolol1,asktransgender,Passing but still too insecure to wear any skirt or dress in public.,"Hi, I'm 23, mtf, and I started transitioning when I was 18 and I still have never worn a dress or a skirt in public and I'd really like to but I'm honestly terrified and I don't know how to get over it.

I go to work as female and can consistently pass most of the time but I'm constantly self-conscious and worrying about being clocked for my big hands, feet or my height.
I see people start transition and quickly start wearing dresses and meanwhile I'm too scared to even wear shorts in public and I'm frustrated with how afraid I am of people thinking bad things about me or seeing me as a man in a dress. I've made some progress recently with wearing makeup and slightly more feminine clothes but at this point I feel stuck and like I'm not able to be myself even after starting transition almost 5 years ago.

I know this isn't really a simple issue with a simple solution but I feel kind of alone in this regard and I'd like to know if anyone else has struggled with this.

tl;dr I started passing as female consistently years ago but I'm too scared to wear any girly clothing in public and I don't know how to get over it."
shatteredtruth,asktransgender,[MtF] About sperm banking,"These questions are for any/all MtF peoples.

* Did you bank sperm?
* What were your reasons for making the choice you made?
* How do you feel about your choice now?
* If you did bank sperm, was it ever used?

Context: I considered banking sperm before starting HRT, but ultimately decided against doing so. The main reason I chose not to is two-fold: Firstly, at 40 I believe that, if I would ever want a child I would already have had at least one by now. Secondly, I wouldn't want to bring a child into the world without being able to properly care for it, and at this point I don't believe I'll ever be financially stable enough to do that.

The kicker though is that I like keeping my options open, and even with the above considerations, the factor that had the most influence on my decision is the financial cost.

Despite some really good rationalisations and after a lot of time spent thinking about this, I am beginning to wonder whether my decision not to bank before starting HRT was premature. I am still early enough in the process where I could temporarily pause HRT long enough to bank, but this is certainly not an ideal option, and I'd like input from others who have been here before, to help me decide where to go from here."
findingserena,asktransgender,Curious about bone structure?,"So, I remember hearing around here that bone structure doesn't really solidify until about age 25, and I know that trans girls who start hormones before then can grow wider hips.

understandinggender,asktransgender,Reaching out to u/georgemitch,"Hi, u/georgemitch,

I've noticed from your recent posts that you are going through a hard time right now. Tough times are part of life, though that doesn't make them any easier to weather when you're in the thick of them. 

One thing you're going through right now seems to be fear about being outed as trans. Understandably, that sucks. But I want to remind you that the person who *most* cares about whether or not you are trans is *you*. The vast, vast majority of people on Earth don't know you, never will, and don't care about your identity. Certainly, your parent and friends will care, either positively or negatively, but please remember that your friends and family are only people, and it is possible that they are very ignorant about trans people. They may or may not support or understand you, but there are plenty of people who will.

You also seem to be experiencing some confusion about sexuality and romantic relationships. From what I've gathered, you are attracted to men, but considering marrying a woman and having children with her, possibly because of outside pressure to do so. I think, regardless of what other people want for you, you deserve to have a partner (man or woman) who aligns with your gender and sexuality orientations. Moreover, I think it would be a recipe for disaster to marry someone and have children with them simply to escape your true self or external criticism - that choice would simply let you, your partner, and your children down. To use your words, it would not be ethical of you to marry someone simply to cover up your true self. So choose to have a partner who aligns with your wants and needs, and only choose to have children if you are happy with yourselves and one another. I also want to remind you that you are young (21?), so you are under no pressure or hurry to meet someone and marry at this time in your life.

It also sounds like you live in an area of the world where LGBT people are not respected or understood. I'm not sure where in the world you are, but I think you should consider moving to the nearest pro-LGBT place. Your English is obviously quite good (maybe it's your native language?), so you already have a highly-marketable skill that will help you in a new place. A major benefit of moving for you will be increased comfort in exploring/living your sexuality and gender identity, I believe.

In closing, it's ok if you're cis and gay or trans and straight or whatever you might be - what really matters is that you live an authentic life for yourself. Some people in your life may not understand that, but they don't get to live or choose your life for you. At the end of the day, your life is for you.

I know you're down now, but all is not lost!"

leydigcellhate,asktransgender,Anyone else here on Luvox (fluvoxamine)? Estradiol interaction...,"Hello,

So I'm wondering if any ladies out there take luvox and estradiol together. There is an interaction between the two causing increasing E levels. The doctor thought it wouldn't make too much of a difference... But now my levels are several thousands pmol/l. 

The problem arises with the inhibition of of the enzyme that clears estrogen from the system. It is inhibited by luvox. 

Anyone have any ways of working this without changing luvox to different med. It is helping my OCD so much...

I meet with my hormone doctor in a few days, but she may not have any ideas apart from changing the luvox. It would be nice if anyone had any experience they could share with this issue.

becoming_madeline,asktransgender,Trans Moms?,"Cross posted to r/translater 

In an earlier post I explained how I stopped transition and returned to hyper masculinity.   I believe I did it for safety and security reasons, it was just an easier way to control things in my life.  With that being stated, I find myself looking back at one key moment this passed Fall.

My wife and I homeschool our 4 kids and we were at a park with the other homeschool mom's, none of them had any idea about me being trans.  I just didn't feel like I could relate to them, I kept thinking if I transitioned they would not accept me, even though they're not overly religious and claim to be tolerant.  This scared me, not enough to stop me, but it compounded all the other feelings.   

I am naturally an invert but my trans side is not, she's actually an angry, outspoken lesbian; I keep feeling like I have multiple personalities, but it's just the two of us.  

How do you socialize, any homeschooling trans moms in here, how do you fit in?

It took me until 22 to finally admit to myself that I was and then it took me three more years to get the courage to begin transition at 25.  

I'm jealous of people who grew up in accepting, loving households in liberal states and could transition earlier.

Tasorow,asktransgender,Why Can't I Feel Strongly About Being a Girl?,"So I got into a car crash with my mom yesterday. No fault of our own, totally the other two drivers' fault. We were honestly really lucky, it was a head-on collision with them going at least 60, and we got hit effectively by two cars. Both of us are alive, though my mom's heel injury could be serious, but it's given me some perspective that I still don't understand. 

I explained how I started thinking about being transgender in a previous post, and since then I've been pretty numb/sad in general. My friend agreed to talk to me about being transgender, and he made me feel validated for a while. The crash kind of messed that up, since I was thinking about transitioning at the time. 

The thing is, yeah, I was angry and scared during the crash, but I was oddly calm after a while. It hasn't really hit me that I or my mom could have died yet, I guess. At one point I thought how I couldn't die without transitioning, and I got sad at the prospect, but part of me felt disingenuous. Background, a lot of people seem to think I'm not transgender, but just fixating on it because of my Asperger's. So I feel really crappy, that I'm being selfish and looking for a tragedy.

Fast forward to today. My mom is in the capital with my dad, and it hit me that no one was home. So I figured why not try on a dress and see what I feel looking in the mirror? So I put some effort into making myself look presentable (stupid short, frizzy hair) and found a dress and sun hat to wear. I definitely felt sad when I looked at the mirror; my stupid shoulders,  my face, my weight, nothing looked right. I mean, I guess thinking about it now it was my body and not the clothes I was judging. There was a moment where my eyes went out of focus and I felt good for a split second, but I mostly just felt sad that I'm so boyish.

I guess this all seems pretty obvious to you all, but I'm more confused and depressed than ever. I wish I was a girl, but I don't feel like one when I look in the mirror. At the same time, I don't feel like I'm even looking at me. You'd think that a severe car crash would make things easier for me, but if anything, it made things worse. I just want to break down and cry and realize if I am a girl or not, but I can't. I have a therapy appointment in a few days, but I don't know what to say anymore."
ranma1_5,asktransgender,Vitamin-D deficiency before HRT?,"A bit of background information for context: I'm in the US Air Force trying to start MTF transition. It's been taking a while, though... (I started talking to mental health about being transgender in early October, and I still have no idea when I'm going to get to start HRT...)  The sudden wave of trans issues throughout the service since the ban was lifted are apparently being handled by a multidisciplinary team, which I think is based in Texas, which my primary care manager where I'm stationed has to consult with about my treatment, which may be part of the reason it's taking so long, but I don't know.

Anyway, I finally had some blood tests done a few weeks back, and the lab work was supposedly forwarded to the MDT after that at some point, and I'm eventually supposed to hear back from them about starting treatment. However, just over a week ago I got a call from my PCM saying that I had a vitamin D deficiency, and he prescribed me a supplement that I'm supposed to take for 12 weeks before returning for more lab work. This is supposedly before the MDT has had a chance to look at my lab results, and the caller didn't say anything regarding my transition or HRT, just that I had been prescribed a supplement.  Of course, me being a depressed emotional wreck due to the steadily increasing dysphoria, I immediately assumed that this meant I would have to wait an additional 12 weeks before starting HRT.  I have no way of knowing if that's true, though; I _still_ haven't heard anything from the MDT, and nobody will tell me anything (this lack of communication has been part of why I've been struggling to keep it together lately).  My mental health counselor said it was a possibility I had to be ready for when I expressed my concern, but she doesn't actually know anything about it and I'm pretty sure she just told me that to encourage me to be mentally prepared so I don't kill myself (I was pretty much inconsolable when I went to see her, so I think that's something she may have been worried about).

Based on the limited frantic research I've done on the issue, I don't _think_ it will affect anything, but not hearing anything has me worried.  From what I've read, a vit-D deficiency can increase risk of osteoporosis.  Supposedly trans women on HRT also have a tendency to develop vit-D deficiencies, but I don't know if that's because of the HRT or because we're all hikikomoris lol.  Also, HRT can supposedly also increase risks of osteoporosis, thus compounding that risk, so from that perspective I can see how this would be a problem that could cause a delay in me starting... On the other hand, I'm taking a supplement so it shouldn't be a problem, and if it _is_ a problem they could just start me off with a lower dose...

-
Anyway, I've been told that vit-D deficiencies are really common, so I'm sure there are at least a few of you who have been diagnosed with one before HRT, so my question is: Is it causing/did it cause a delay in HRT prescription for you?  I'm sure I'm just freaking out over nothing, but hearing from you guys would help a lot - and if it really is an issue, it's better to know that for sure so I can get used to it instead of fretting over it like I have been.

**TL;DR I got diagnosed with a vitamin-D deficiency and I'm scared it will cause further delays in getting HRT. I just want less shit skin and real boobs, not these stupid silicon bra inserts ;_;**

babygirlskunk,asktransgender,Has anyone ever been so far as to HRT,"I didn't know what to Google so I came here. 

I am a trans guy early in transition who is dating a trans woman. We're both on injections for our HRT. 

I stopped getting my period back in December and then once she started living with me, not only did it resume, but I felt way more emotionally unstable in general and just...closer to my pre-T self in a way that's profoundly unsettling to me. 

Is it at all possible that somehow her levels are affecting me? My dose has not changed, if anything I raised it a bit. "
SourBitz,asktransgender,I came out to my general practitioner...,I came out to my general practitioner. It was not something easy for me to say that I felt like a girl inside a male's body. I was quite nervous to say it. I guess I was bummed out about my doctor's reaction. I thought the doctor would have been interested in hearing my story in why I felt like that.  She just suggested me to go see counseling. I haven't told anyone how I've been feeling.  I was thinking my GP would help me out in my situation. Perhaps giving me a dosage on low HRT is something I've been considering. How can I convince my doctor? I don't want to go the route of talking to a counselor or a therapist to me its a waste of time.
cherry_chocolate,asktransgender,How do I cope?,"Hello. 

During the last time I've been questioning my gender identity more and more. Yet I don't know if I'm trans or if it's ""just"" linked to my history of mental illness (hope that doesn't come off the wrong way).

I'm born male and mid twenties. I've been suffering from social anxiety all my life plus phases of depression. I'm in one right now. Never had any friends. Same for relationships. Never even hold hands with someone. 

In so many ways I feel like a bad male stereotype and I wish things would be different. 

I'm both unhappy with my body and keep wishing I had a different one. I keep envying women for various reasons. 

I wish I had another body. I wish I'd be small and delicate. I wish I had a partner that was able to lift me up and hold me in his/her hands. And many other reasons. 

I just want to get away from my body. I am unable to cry. I did it less than ten times since I was a small kid. Even when I wanted to, even when I knew it would be helpful. I can't do it. 

Some of my problems are almost directly linked to my gender. My sexuality is skewed and wierd and severely eroded my selfworth. I tried to get rid of it and change it but it has been like this even before puberty and trying to suppress it was only harmful. It's linked to something that happened to me when I was in kindergarten and I just keep thinking that I wouldn't be this way if I was female. It's a long story and I suffered a lot about this. 

If I had a magic button to be born female or wake up being it the next morning I'd push it in an instant. But I feel like even transition wouldn't give me what I want. 

I just want to get away from this body. 

I wish I did have another life.

valerie_6966,asktransgender,Can progesterone cause anxiety and panic attacks?,"Hey everybody, how we doin today!

So the last couple months I had been one progesterone pill at night before I went to bed. (Sorry, not sure how many mg's that is) 

On New Years eve, which is about 2 weeks after I started taking them, my friends and I took some MDMA and I ended up being up all night having panic attack after panic attack after panic attack. I was visiting him on the other side of the country so I sorta couldn't do anything about it. And I've had panic attacks before so I tried my best to remain calm. I had some really serious lingering anxiety for awhile afterwards, like for the next two weeks. But then I was sorta getting back to normal, through a ton of mental effort. All the while still taking progesterone. 

Then fast forward another week or so, and I started having all of this intense fear and regret about my transition and I was having full blown panic attacks again and I have no idea why it was so sudden and unprompted, which of course made the panic even worse! 

So I didn't take any hormones that night because I was just so sick I couldn't swallow any of my pills. 

Then I started feeling regret and dysphoria again, like the night before and I was starting to consider stopping my transition because I was getting all of this unreasonable fear and just horrible anxiety. 

Meanwhile I've been talking to this guy and discussing everything I've been going through and I sort of started wondering if the progesterone could be having this effect. 

-yes, the first night of panic attacks was probably triggered by the MDMA
-yes, the lingering anxiety could've just been some chemical imbalance mixed with a little PTSD of the night
-yes the horrible regret and panic could've been intrusive thoughts that held some merit

""But when did this really all start?"" I wondered.

And it was around the time I started taking progesterone! 

So I stopped taking it, for a couple days. And my anxiety felt a lot better. Still there? But manageable. Then I took it one night, and my anxiety was bad again the next morning. And I've stopped since then, and that was last week.

Before I couldn't even write this up because thinking about it all threw me into a panic attack so I couldn't address it. But I feel pretty much fine right now. 

So I'm wondering, can progesterone be the cause of all of this?? Or is it just my head attaching panic to progesterone for some unknown reason that causes the anxiety. 

Like I said, 1 week off of it as of right now, and the anxiety is very very low to non-existent. 

What do you think?"

WithApplomb,asktransgender,Mentally Exhausted,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old trans girl and pre-hrt, pre-coming out basically pre-anything and everything.  I only really recently discovered what transitioning could mean and that it was even an option.  So when I discovered that, ""hey I could do this!"" it was almost no effort for me to say ""yes I want to transition to be a girl"".  Alas even accepting myself it's not that simple and the next question was ""wait, why did I accept that so easily? Maybe I'm just trying to find a problem where there isn't one and maybe...

I then went on to explore and list out basically every excuse for me not being ""really trans"" that I managed to come across.  The thing is, I've realized that my severe apathy bordering on hatred towards myself and life in general and my persistent 'fantasies' and desires to become a girl seem to be pretty related.  Maybe not being able to get through a day without thinking ""wow I should have been born a girl"" or ""I wish I could swap lives with x"" etc. should have been a sign but being uninformed and being too busy thinking thoughts like ""I would not be upset at all if a nuclear bomb just wiped out all of humanity right now"" or ""wouldn't it be amazing to just kill myself and fade into nothing!?"" have sort of kept me from putting two and two together.  Fortunately, the reality of life seeming to be that I CAN transition and I CAN have a future that will be what I want have led me to having some more uplifting thoughts that involve a lot less pain and death.  Alas I am still nowhere near the girl that I want to be and am still plagued by some pretty intense discomfort and dysphoria in day to day life which is exasperated by not being out to anybody except for my therapist.  I am in the step of figuring out how to come out to friends and family and it feels like every waking moment is spent thinking about my problems and it's leaving me exhausted.  It feels like I've been waging a war in my own head by and against myself for so many years without confiding in or talking to anyone and lately it's reached a peak.  I know I need to take one problem at a time, but it seems like there's a lot of them to tackle and I'm feeling very overwhelmed and just exhausted.  Escapism isn't helping as it has in the past and I'm not even sure where to begin.

TL:DR I am mentally exhausted and I haven't even taken a step forward, how do I begin to think and act healthier during the early stages/pre-transition?"

Ask-Alice,asktransgender,Anyone else have a rough time adjusting to estradiol?,"I've been taking spiro since June, and 1mg estradiol since early january.

I don't think there's been any day where I've felt 100% since I started. My sleep is also starting to get a bit messed up, like for the past 3 nights I've only been able to sleep 6 hours, making me tired by the evening, where I usually sleep like 9-12 hours. It's pretty discouraging that my body isn't reacting well to estradiol.

i may get older and die alone just like that, having given up a warm great family with a loving wife.

i have a career and an employer where env is friendly. and i made poor decisions in career, but i will live.

I have been imagining situations in which I tell the news in a very casual way. Not everyone, but a few people (so far).

Example 1:
I have some shirts to give to my sisters (younger twins but not terribly far from my size). 
Below is how I keep imagining the conversation:
&gt;Sis: Why do you have these shirts?

&gt;Me: I bought them for a woman but she didn't like the style after all.

&gt;sis: Oh, who is she? (I don't have many friends and it's not like a huge city, and my family is like that)

&gt;Me: Me! So who wants them?

Example 2:
When I tell my mom I somehow hope she says something about ""losing her son"" so I can say ""Not so much losing a son as gaining a daughter."" (Monty Python)

Part of me thinks for some reason that is a good idea. Just boom it's out. The other part definitely knows that is not a good idea and it's very serious news.

I am curious if anybody has any experience with this kind of thought process and how to maybe curb that behavior? 

Or if you did something like this what was your experience?

NotPranking,asktransgender,therapy question,"Hi all first time posting. I recently came out to my girlfriend about being transgender in the beginning of the month. Since then I have been going through phases of ""Oh it’s going to be great I can wait until I move out and am not financially dependent on my father and seek out a consent clinic to get hormones."" and then fighting the self-destructive thought phases. My girlfriend recently told me that she is really limited in what she can do to help me until I graduate and seek out help. So, she recommended that I seek out a therapist in my area to talk to at least talk to someone about my family and home life, but I wouldn’t mind talking to someone in general about how I feel about being transgender. I was wondering if anyone out there could give me advice on how they got over seeing a therapist for the first time. I don’t want my parents to know simply because I don’t know how they will react if I tell them how I feel since I grew up in an Irish catholic family. 
Tldr: Told girlfriend I’m transgender. She is supportive but wants me to find a therapist. I am terrified and would like some advice on getting over that fear.

lyaa55,asktransgender,trans fugues and mental shifts,"HIII

So I'm like 5 months into HRT.  I feel like my brain is very different.  Like, I'm definitely happier and less anxious; I used to have sorts of violent thoughts and would bouts of debilitating anxiety, and now I think i'm pretty well adjusted.  Honestly my brain just feels enormously calm in a way that I'm not used to.  Which like, in itself is almost disconcerting.  I don't know if my brain always had to dart around to avoid confronting my gender shit, and now it's just allowed to chill and relax a little bit more.  Maybe also my estrogen levels are a little low (?) and so i'm somewhat more subdued than I should be (does that sound right?)

Maybe it's also how uneven my social transition is--- I'm using different names and pronouns in different settings and constantly navigating different states of inbetweenness, which seems like it could contribute to a somewhat estranged mental state.

I don't know; I want to hear about other people who felt palpable ""brain shifts"" or had feelings of self-estrangement (but not necessarily in a bad way?  But maybe?) during hormonal transition.  Am I feeling like i'm becoming more and more separate from my past self and need to reforge a large part of my identity?

Over the past couple weeks I have explored a number of trans related boards both out of curiosity and a strange sense of relation, as it occurred to me I can relate with certain things. Sorry if this seems to be any bit trivializing anyone else's experiences, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about this for the past week or so now. Ever since I developed an attraction to the female form, I remember my interest as being different. When I see a woman I find attractive, I don't quite wish to be in a relationship with that woman, but rather to *be* that woman (in terms of feminine beauty and aesthetic). It's been like this since I was much younger, but I had always attributed it to being some sort of strange fantasy, as I do still have ""standard"" attraction to the female form to a fair degree. I have never quite felt like or acted like most other boys really, feeling more comfortable around my sisters than my brother and always being rather ""effeminate"" for a boy. I've never quite cared for my male figure or male style, always being uninterested in my body, which lead me to being rather *large* up until probably around a year and a half ago when I finally bothered to care about my well being. The thing is, I'm well into ""manlet"" territory as far as male height goes, and as I became overall skinny (lost a *lot* of weight) I realized I'm actually in possession of a build much closer to my sisters than the males of my family. I actually felt a sense of pride in being so slender and petite, with no desire to accumulate muscle really, if anything just to be more feminine in appearance. Really though, one of the things I've questioned the most is my perception of the world around me. I feel as if I live in a world of grey, cold and distant from others around me or the ticking of the world, in all honesty I've thought I'm perhaps somewhat sociopathic in my view of the world. I want to care for others and have a zest for life, but I've always felt this sort of general unease with life that I've had to cover up with something, be it a food or video game addiction for example. It really hadn't occurred to me these might be significant to anything until I looked into gender dysphoria, these feelings are plainly all I've known up until very recently. Since I realized this might be gender dysphoria, I haven't been able to get it off my mind, and the more I think about myself as a member of the opposite sex the more it occurs me to how much I desire that. I'm not suicidal however, and feel as If I could probably quell these feelings, so I question if this is terribly sincere. Part of the reason I ask because I'll moving out soon, to my own place in a much larger town, and will have actual opportunity to further explore this. I apologize for the length of this, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on the matter. Please note it will be about until the same time as posting this that I check this again tomorrow, honestly thanks for any response."
IACheryl,asktransgender,Is non-forehead FFS a scam?,"Whenever I look at FFS Before&amp;Afters the forehead is the only thing that looks any different.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Am I moving too fast?,"I know some people start HRT and wait years to come out to everyone. I'm curious how people do that. I'm pretty much out to everyone and fairly open about my transition. I've contacted HR at work and I'm meeting with them next week. 

I've been on HRT for just under 5 months and still pretty doubtful of myself. But when I look in the mirror and see ""her"" I'm not completely unhappy. I guess I just don't feel like ""her"" yet. 

And that's what makes this so hard to decide what to do next. I'd love to go do gender marker changes and name changes and all that stuff, but I'm just full of doubts. I'm jealous of my friends who are pretty certain of themselves. I'm not exactly the most patient person in the world, and sometimes I feel like I'm moving much faster than the people who are certain of themselves. I guess I don't get how I can get to that point.

I mean, I'm talking to HR and then to my direct supervisor not much longer after that. But I'm not planning on completely coming out to everyone at work yet (although many know because I've told them outside of work), and I'm definitely not going full time soon. I just feel like this is something I need to do so people can be aware of it ahead of time. 

But I just wonder if I'm moving too fast because I'm uncertain of myself? I mean, I really like hormones and things they're doing to my body physically. Boobs? Cool. Skin? Awesome. Lack of sex drive? Miracle. Weight gain? Not so cool, but I'm trying to work on it. It's just the mental part of this that I haven't sorted out yet. And my depression and anxiety have been kicking my now significantly more feminine butt lately. Especially the anxiety part for quite some time.

I guess I'm just over here wondering if I'm going too fast while daydreaming of doing some of these other things.

Thoughts? *sigh*"
throwcrying,asktransgender,Self conscious after mum questioning me,"Context: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5sbwkx/loneliness_depression_cant_do_it_anymore/

So yesterday I was really upset, was crying all day and didn't leave my room much. I made the above post, some of which was an overreaction (more on that later). My mum has always been overprotective, nagging, nosy/clingy, needs to know everything, etc.

So last night my mum texted me saying ""we need to talk"", which always means a heavy talk about me. I assumed it was about me not leaving my room and responded saying I didn't want to talk about it and it was 11pm, I just wanted to sleep. She acted guilty and said it wasn't about that, so I assumed she had a problem of her own she wanted help with and let her in my room. She immediately starts talking about me isolating myself and not leaving my room. Next minute, she's saying I'm not trying hard enough to transition, saying I don't seem to be practising my voice and makeup enough, etc. She asks if I really want to be a girl or not, and that I ""seem like a scared young man"".

No shit I want to be a girl, I've felt like this for 6 years, I broke down crying when I told her this a month ago and she literally asked me that? No shit I'm fucking scared, I'm only 1.5 months on HRT and will lose all my friends when I come out, extended family will think I'm a freak (conservative Catholics), I won't pass in public for another 6 months and passing matters to me; there's a million reasons for me to be scared. I'm embarrassed about how deep my voice is and we have thin walls and I'm not out to my older brothers, so no, I haven't been practising my voice much. I don't always have the chance to practice makeup when I work 5 days a week, can only do it late at night, and need to wipe off every speck of it so as to not be outed at work.

I kept reminding her that I'll come out to siblings when I'm comfortable, I'll do this/that when I'm comfortable, it's not something you can force or push or do overnight. Then she's like ""we can help pay for surgery, it CAN be overnight"" like what? Having facial surgery might give me feminine facial features, but I'm still 1.5 months on HRT and likely wouldn't pass. Besides, it's not something you can just throw money at. Money would help me in lots of areas, specifically being independent and not needing to work my current job (talking about not working my job anymore was the only helpful part of the entire discussion), but it won't just make me look like a girl overnight.

Then she says I need therapy, and while that was suggested in the previous post, I just don't see how talking about this will help me. Talking about the fact that I don't pass and am not out won't make me pass, it won't help, it'll just make me feel worse about my situation. At least, that's just how I see it. Perhaps I'm misguided, but I imagine therapy to go like, ""I'm upset because I don't pass"" - ""okay, lets talk about you not passing"" - ""yay, lets talk and I'll feel all better"". ???

When I had to remind her that it's a big change and I don't want to feel pressured by her all the time, and I'm doing things when I'm comfortable while hormones do their work, she got all defensive. Like, ""this isn't just about you, this is a big change for me too"" - obviously, if you have a question or are struggling to understand something, then ASK the question or frame the conversation in a way that you're trying to understand; don't lie about what you want to talk about, come into my room then tell me I need therapy, I'm not trying hard enough, question whether I'm legitimate and accuse me of being a scared boy? No wonder I don't want to talk to you? I've explained as much as I possibly can in the past, we've had several conversations like this. She always has the mindset of ""just have surgery and you'll look like a women derp"".

Next was, ""if I were you, I'd want to make it happen overnight"". Well, you aren't me, it can't be done overnight and even if it could, it's still dependent upon whether I'm ready to lose friends, ready to come out to family, ready to present female in public even though I don't pass, etc. The whole point of me being upset is that I don't pass and I'm stuck in a job that I don't feel comfortable working in.

I'm happy we had the talk, because I learned that when dad retires (very soon) they'll be giving the kids a lump of money to help us all out, which means I can stop working my job. I'm really grateful for that, you can tell they're amazing parents. It's just, now I'm questioning myself. Am I not trying hard enough? Is it my fault I'm upset because I'm not trying hard enough? Is it my fault I don't pass yet, because I haven't trained my voice/makeup frequently enough? I know people will say ""see! you need therapy!"" but I wasn't asking these questions before my mum brought it all up.

Am I justified in being annoyed about this? Or is she right and I need to ""try harder""?"
Awenrising,asktransgender,Applying for Jobs,"So after 11 years at my current employer I am itching to use my expertise in a field that I am passionate about.

I found a company that I want to apply to who also happens to be very open in their views of the trans community. The thing is I am not out full time at my current employer because though they also have a positive view, it's hard to correct 11 years worth of male me.

My question is how has everyone's experience been when applying for jobs as their preferred gender prior to truly passing? 

Should I just continue to present male and come out later or should I just tell them up front and put my preferred name on the application?"
Throwaway74089,asktransgender,Period Envy,"Hi, I'm an 18 Pre-Everything trans girl. Apologies if there is anything non-PC or triggering in this thread. I don't very often post in trans communities so I'm not sure of the etiquette. 


I have a huge amount of dysphoria relating to periods. 


I have amazing friends who love me for me, who know my situation, and who treat me like they would any other girl. That being said, it's a curse and a blessing when my friends bring up periods. I love that they talk with me about them like they would any of their other female friends, but I have so many feelings about not having them. 


Guilt, that I'm trying to live life as a woman without ""paying my dues"" and enduring one of the sucky parts of that life (which I know is ridiculous but I can't help but feel it). Awkwardness that no matter how much I read up on the subject, I'll never be able to speak from experience to add to the conversation. Sadness and this awful sense of dread that I'll never be ""normal"" like my friends are. 


I know that a ton of cisgendered women don't get periods. And I'm sure they experience a lot of the same emotions I do. I just don't know how they deal with them. I also, from a post on another forum, don't think that many transwomen have as much difficulty with this as I do. This is probably the biggest source of my dysphoria, which I know is weird because it's such a little thing. 


Any woman out there who struggles with this as well and have found a way to make it better... How have you found peace with your situation, or what have you done to make it easier? "

feeling_supersonic,asktransgender,Do you have suggestions for a name change ceremony? I struggle with my names.,"Hey. I've been going by my chosen name (the male form of my birthname, just had to remove the -a ending) for one and a half years now. I chose it because it was convenient (still is) and I am really attached to it's unisex nickname.

Lately I have been struggling with my old name. I suddenly started absentmindedly writing it into online forms again. I even introduced myself with it. I was totally shocked at myself. And I have anxiety about people finding my old name out easier because it is so similar to my new one.

Also I never really hated my old name, it's very pretty, it just didn't suit me. I think the main problem is that I associate the new name with the old name and the old name with a lot of painful memories. 

I'd like to do some kind of ceremony to let go of the old name, maybe it would help. Do you have any suggestions on how I could symbolise this? I'm imagining doing something outdoors, maybe in spring."

bashfultransboi,asktransgender,What fictional characters influenced the sort of person you hope to become post-transition?,"I don't really know how else to word this, so I'll give a bit of context.

I frequent some gay-focused subs and there was a discussion today about what it means exactly to be ""masculine"". I didn't offer an opinion as I felt it may be somewhat out of place, but I've never strived to be a ""masculine"" man, only a ""good"" man.

When I was a kid and teen I was heavily into fiction, particularly of historical and fantasy persuasion. There have been some male characters that have never really left me, in a way.

For me, the most important is [Sam from the movie and film ""Holes""](https://youtu.be/sus_4_6Fr9o). I don't know what it was about him exactly but he had a sort of wise purity about him, and I have found myself recently trying to emulate his dress and way of speaking, and I have always been a bit of a fixer and restorer for other people. 

on a side note, if you would like to see more about him, you can find it here in [The Legend of Kissin' Kate Barlow](https://youtu.be/T1qYFafNPbU).

The second is a character named Simon from a book by Juliet Marillier called Daughter of the Forest. His story was a bit tragic but despite all of the awful things that happened, his goodness in the end prevailed. 

I learned a lot from Disney Princess movies too, and all of these representations inspired for me a ""recipe for a good man"" that I have recently finally started to become (I think). 

Who has been a model for you, whether for physical attributes such as fashion and style or lifestyle attributes? 

thanks for your contribution! "
AnnieHatesMe,asktransgender,My mom is being really nonchalant about me starting HRT. Is this normal?,"She's known I'm transgender for a few years.  Recently I've told her that I'm starting HRT soon.  Her reaction was that she was worried about my the health risks of HRT so I took her to a doctor's appointment and she just listened without asking any questions.

She knows I've been agonizing over this choice for years and she's never said a word against it.  She only has said that she trusts me to make the best choice for myself.  

I once straight up asked her did you ever suspect I was transgender when I was a kid?  Her answer was ""Never thought about anything like that.  You're just my baby so thinking about that stuff wasn't important to me.""  

Then I asked what do you think of me starting HRT?  She said ""I don't know much about transgender issues but since you told me that it is something that you must do, I trust that is true.  You make your own decisions, you'll always be my child."" 

Other than when I bring it up, she never talks about it at all.  I'm starting hormones in a few months and she just seems really nonchalant like this literally doesn't matter at all to her.  It's a big change for me.  

Is this normal behavior?  Or do you think she is not telling me something?

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,"I came out to my mom, and it went horribly.","I told her everything. I told her that I am trans. I told her how hard it was to hide my clothes from her. I told her how frustrating the last few months have been. She was heart broken, we could not look at each other in the eyes. She then asked questions: how long have I known this? If there was any way that this could be a mistake?
I told her that it was not a mistake, and that the only way for me to heal was to transition. She then warmed up to it, put a smile on her face, and told me that she was glad I told her.



It was then that I thought that things did not turn out as bad as I thought. My thoughts were something along the lines of 'Maybe things are going to be okay!'
And for the next two hours or so things were okay. We talked, we laughed, we had fun until it was time to leave.
Later on, she came into my room. She could not look at me. Her face was scrunched and her nose was sniffling and the moment that I looked into her eyes I saw that they were sparkling with tears. She said, ""This is all my fault. I was a terrible mom. I just wish there was a way to fix this! I'm so sorry. I feel like I've left you down. I'm a terrible mom.""



For a long time she continued to cry, and ask if there was anything that she could do to fix things. And I told her that, no, there was nothing she could do. I told her that nothing needs to be fixed. I told her that the reason that I want to take hormones is because it will make me happier.



But she continued to cry, and cry, until she left the room.
I feel so lost right now. I feel terrible. I feel good for coming out, but it kills me to see how much this is hurting my mother.

ThrowawayA2SEP,asktransgender,Unvarnished and unrestrained experiences with SRS?,"At the suggestion of u/SobriKate, I am making this thread. Put simply, I'm in need of detailed accounts of SRS that are as blunt and no-holds-barred as possible with regards to both recovery, results, and long-term outcomes. To be more specific, I'm concerned with such topics as rate and degree of nerve reconnection, complications, scarring, appearance, resilience/fragility of neo-vag, dilation, lubrication, change of all of that over time, and practical quality and difference of work between the various surgeons. The last thing I'm looking for is yet another Pollyanna-ish all-smiles sort of story on this topic, because what I need is the reality, not optimism for optimism's sake. 

My reason for this is pretty simple; at present, I find non-op and pre-/post-op pathways to be equally unlikable and thus non-options, which logically can't stand because it's a very either/or sort of situation, and so in getting such accounts I would hope to come closer to deciding which is more appropriate for me. 

Now ideally I would want unbiased and objective takes on this, but it has been assured to me that this is nigh impossible, so I won't set out to be too picky. Still, the closer to that ideal the better obviously.

I also realize that this can be a difficult subject, particularly if someone's experience has been less than ideal. As such, I would be glad to go straight to PMs with those that feel it best."

I haven't come out to my parents but I've cut my hair and slowly started presenting more masc. Sometimes I get called 'he' in public by servers at restaurants etc. but usually I'm mistaken for a young boy. I'm 19 so I guess I look like a pre-teen boy.

T1res1as,asktransgender,Emulating birth gender typical behaviour whilst closeted?,"I have felt I have been emulating male behaviour all my life. And like computer emulators it soaks up resources. You need a way beefier machine to run f.inst a Nintendo 16-bit console emulator smoothly than the original console.

It is like you took a left handed person and forced them to do everything with the right (Which did happen in schools before way back when they spanked people.). They would have to insert another mental step into the process and it would slow everything they did down.

fuzzybad,asktransgender,How to handle a (possibly narcissist) non-supportive parent?,"I'd like to hear some opinions on the following.  Sorry, this is going to be somewhat long.  TL;DR below.

I'm pretty certain my mother is a narcissist.  I'm an adult (43) and we have had kind of a truce since I moved out from under her ~~thumb~~ roof when I graduated high school, but my recent transition has upset the balance.  She lives in another city and was initially ""ok"" with my transition, as long as she was able to ignore it.  Even though I wrote her a long letter, sent her educational resources, etc, she refuses to see me in person, on Skype, use my true name or pronouns, or acknowledge my transition whatsoever.  In one of her messages she referred to my profile picture looking like a ""pseudo woman.""

Apparently, other family members have been asking her about me, forcing her to confront reality, and this has prompted numerous dramatic messages from her, to the point where I told her I would not respond further to texts and blocked her number.   So far all has been quiet since then, but it feels like the calm before the storm.  I'm considering going full no contact (NC) which is a common way to deal with narcissists, at least temporarily.  I'm certainly not going to lose any sleep over losing this relationship, actually it feels like a relief.

A little bit on the narcissist part, I'm not a psychologist but I believe she exhibits the classic symptoms.  For example, her numerous angry texts seemed to imply that I'm a horrible person because I didn't consider her feelings when I transitioned, or how her family would think of her as a result.  Apparently, she would prefer that I have a miserable, suicidal life as long as the family doesn't look down on her for having an adult transgender child.  

Little bit of backstory, she divorced my father when I was around 7-8 years old for no better reason than she ""wanted her freedom.""  This resulted in me, a young child at the time, being dragged away from everyone and everything I knew to an inner-city school, probably the worst in the district.  During this time she routinely left me alone at night while she went on dates, and I started to cut class all the time and began to break into her liquor cabinet.  After a few years of this, she dragged me to another town &amp; school where she married a guy who looked like Freddy Krueger (I'm not making this up, he'd been in an accident) for the rest of my school years.  After I graduated and moved away, she promptly divorced that guy and moved to another state.  

She routinely uses emotional blackmail and gaslighting, for example when I came out to her she tried to argue that I ""showed no signs as a child.""  That's funny, because I clearly remember stating when I was a child that I wanted to be a girl, to the point where they told me to stop talking about it.  I wasn't allowed to have pink or purple as a favorite color, but red was acceptable.  I used to have a favorite doll, until it mysteriously vanished one day.  I always wanted to have long hair, but was forced to have it cropped.  I suffered from depression as a child.  So it's weird that ""there were no signs.""

transthrowaway38,asktransgender,Are these doubts normal?,"Ok, so for background, I am a 15 year old, AMAB, and have been on and off questioning my gender identity for about 2 and a half years now; I identified as non-binary for about a year, but since last December I've been thinking that I might be MtF. However, I've been having a lot of little (read:large) doubts, and my confidence in that conclusion has been rather erratic.

My largest concern has been that I don't really have any dysphoria, at least none that's noticeable; I just think that it would've been better to have been born with a female body. I don't dislike my body, well, at least I don't dislike it because of it's masculine features. I also don't really have any thoughts when it comes to stuff like wishing I had a girls upbringing and stuff like that. It just kinda seems like I'm not actually trans and I'm just having a ""grass is always greener"" kinda thing.

I should say what caused me to start thinking I might been trans in the first place. I kinda noticed a lot of little stuff that I thought might indicate that I was trans, like, I've worn skirts and leggings before and really really liked both, I've worn makeup before and liked it. I've also had many dreams where I was a girl, but usually the fact that I happened to be a girl in said dreams had no real effect on the rest of the dream. I've also daydreamed about being a girl on several occasions.

I guess what I'm asking is: Are these kind of doubts common, and am I trans? Or am I just non-binary, or a crossdresser or something?

Edit: Oh, and I just realized I should probably mention that I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Asperger's Syndrome."

hippykicker61,asktransgender,"I'm in love with her, but we have to wait.","Straight cis male here.

A little backstory.  I've known this girl for a couple years now, maybe 6 months before she came out as MTF.  We have the same hobbies, so we saw each other all the time, and we hung out on the internet playing games and stuff.

Fast foreward to last summer.  We both needed roommates at the same time, so i offered.  We've been living together since, and it's been great.  So great that once i actually got to know her better I immediately began to fall in love with her.  
I've introspected on it a lot, and my feelings for her are stronger than I've ever felt for anybody.

Here's the problem.  She's about a year and a half into HRT, and the spiro has blocked her sex drive.  She's gotta stay on it until SRS (2017 could be the year her name gets picked off the waiting list )
And even if that wasnt the case, she's really not comfortable with relationships til after SRS.  Totally understandable.

So we talked a few months back, and i told her that I love her, and that i wanted to begin a long term relationship.  I told her that its fine that she doesnt want things to get sexual until she gets surgery, and that despite that I would gladly be her boyfriend.  
There was a lot more to the conversation, but essentially we agreed to reopen this discussion once she gets to that next step.

Things have been great since (we talked in october) and if anything our relationship has become stronger since.  I still flirt, and go out of my way to compliment her, and generally respond to her feminine cues.  I really want her to be happy, and I really think she's been doing a lot better.

What should i do to help her out?
I plan on surprising her for valentines day.
Does anybody have a similar experience?

It could be over a year before the topic of relationship comes up, and I truly think we'd be a fantastic couple.  I just dont wanna screw up in the meantime, or disappoint her."

CelestialSeraphir,asktransgender,Sera's facial shaving guide for everyone who wants to do that,"So I've tought a few people how to do this method and everyone came back to me saying their face has never been smoother. It's the cheapest method I know of that you can use regularly and get a really smooth face. And it's super convenient since you can do it every time you shower. So! Here it is:

You will need:

- A waterproof electric shaver, I prefer the 3 headed rotary shavers like this for the closest shave: http://www.bestelectricshaverhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rotary-electric-shaver.jpg. However the oscillating meshy hole ones should work too. (Either type will run you about $40 USD every few years, my current one is still going after 6)

- A shower (woo!)

- An exfoliating facial cream. Whether it be a moisturiser, cleanser, oil controller, whatever, as long as it gently removes dead skin cells from your face. (Will go for just a few bucks at a supermarket, maybe 10 USD, usually lasts like 6 months). Soap works if you're desparate but I highly recommend getting a proper cream.

- Conditioner. Thats it. Just make sure it doesn't irritate your skin.


How to do it:

1. Shower time, get in, do your thangs, and if you're conditioning your hair, do that before shaving and leave it in (deep conditions rule yo)

2. Wet your face, then let it drip a bit.

3. Get your facial exfoliant cream, put a big fat grain of rice sized dollop in your hands and rub them together.

4. Rub your creamy hands all over wherever the hair grows on your face and neck. Once applied, rub the cream in gently all over with the tips of your fingers

5. Leave it in for a few seconds, then rinse your face clean.

6. If you left conditioner in at this point, pull your hair away from your face and just dab your hands on your head to pick up a bit, and start rubbin' them face hairs! If you didn't then a dollop the size of your fingernail is enough to cover everything.

7. Now whip out that shaver and go to mow town. Be careful not to press too hard on your skin, your freshly exfoliated skin combined with the conditioner makes sure it will glide with ease but also makes it quite sensitive. DO make sure you rub your face with your other hand as you go to check for rough spots that you missed. It's a foolproof method of getting smooth aaaalll over, them fingertips are senstitive so use 'em.

8. Wash off the conditioner from yourself and the shaver and hey! Congrats smoothskin!

Wayyy cheaper than buying razors and shaving cream every other week imo, enjoy! :D"
_E_V_,asktransgender,Hormone difficulties,"I wanted to ask some questions about hormones types and dosages but first the problem.


 I've been on Premarin for about 15mo with increases every 3mo to where I'm at now(7.5mg). I feel terrible, I can't sleep, I'm depressed, my skin has become very dry and itchy, and I've had uncontrollable weight gain(a lot of it in the stomach). I have had some laser done and for a while I was shaving less than once a week and now I'm back to daily shaving. My body hair also seems to have increased growth rate. My last blood test which was when I was at 5mg had me at 80 pg/ml and my doctor insists that my T has been low enough for long enough to not worry about testing it (that test also costs me money so I didn't really argue). My doctor increased my dose because he said my symptoms could be from low hormone levels but it feels like it's only gotten worse since my increase a month ago. 


My question is if anyone has experience with Premarin and was good or bad for them? Maybe it's time to try a different method? Would a different oral type make a difference? For reference I am also on 100mg spiro. Thanks in advance for any thoughts. "

I have done a lot of research on being trans and have concluded that this is what I need. I know a lot of it is like jumping through hoops of fire but I think it's worth it for the end result.

My first ""Hoop"" if you will has been coming out. I have 2 older brothers both graduated from college and moved away and 1 sister who is only 1 year older than me. I have actually already tried to come out to her almost a year and a half ago now but she took it as a joke and that has scared me from coming out to the rest of my family.

I know my father will probably be far far more accepting than my mother will ever be but I don't know how I will be able to transition in this early stage of my life without permission. Waiting until i'm 18 scares the hell out of me. I haven't really hit puberty yet but I'm very close. What I was wondering is if anyone has any advice for my situation. Can I do some of the things I want for transition (HRT and Blockers) With only one parents permission if they are divorced? And how do I come out in general should I do it in a letter or just talk to them or what.

justforlollipop,asktransgender,Confused and wasting time?,"So, hello. Last few days I became very confused. I don't really know if I am transgender. This question bothers me for more than six months. I just can't decide who I am. Yes, I live like a stranger with my body.. My mind is separate with it.
Well, for the half of the year I'm wasting my time. I had a diary. It didn't help me at all. I felt different every other week. Sometimes I'm totally fine with being male and very LGBT phobic. I say to myself that these thoughts are just gross and silly. I'm glad that this condition was happening at the past, now I'm off it.
But also I was very dysphoric sometimes. I was suicidal and craved for hrt. I was jealous of girls' gender. But these feelings didn't last very long. Sometimes I just forgot about it and continue to live as an old myself.. I am hiding from myself and life in the internet. And while I'm doing it I'm fine. I just live as a male, functioning and then escaping the reality.
So, last month and a half I was trying to buy some hormones. I didn't find everything that I need in my town and it stopped me from taking it. Within time I'm not sure if I want to start hrt. I saw some mtftm posts and then I started to think about me as a confused person..again.
Now the most scary thing for me is that I don't mind of being agender. I don't want to fully be a girl and also hate being a testosteroned male. I just want to be ""something in between"". But..
If I am agender what should I do? Hrt will make me growing breasts but not doing it [hrt] I will grow some male signs which I also hate. I hope it is a phase or something because I'm very confused.
And the last issue is that I don't have time. Now I already have not very small lines above the eyes and it keeps growing. I don't have time. I need to decide very quickly what I want. I'm not sure who I will be tomorrow. And my age.. Within 3 months I will be 17. 
So, it is my situation. I'm very confused right now. I've recently had a depression also and thought seriously about suicide. My question is: What should I do? I will lose my sanity soon if I continue going this way. Thanks for reading.
Also sorry for my english, I'm not a native speaker."
K93B72,asktransgender,Is it possible to live without a transition?,"I am 19 years old and on my way of becoming a lawyer. I did start a relationship with a girl to stop my family from pressuring me. (I am not into girls and I don't want to sleep with boys being one myself. I hope you understand, what I am saying. They thought, that I was gay, because I did not bring home a girl.) Funnily I learned to love her and so did she. We are living together for 2 years now. I have the strong desire to be a woman (for I am born male). This was a part of me since I was a child and as long as I can remember. It was a rough time, but I moved along and was a boy, because I blended in. I now have the freedom to start therapiy/transition, all that would be necessary to be happy and live a life, which would be bearable.

I would ruin the future of my girlfriend. She is supportive and helps me in every way possible. Her love is unconditionable. She desires to carry a child of mine. She would have to face discrimination and start a family way to early, if I were to transition now. I am honest, not everyone ends up being a passable woman. It's suicide or transition for most of us,even for me it is a struggle everyday, but I ask myself and you as of now: Is it possible to withstand the urge, the crippling depression and all that comes with dysphoria? May I live to be father without harming the child, disrupting its devellopment or hurting my wife? Can I be sure, that I will live to see her grow up? I need your advice.

aiskwsik,asktransgender,"Difference between gender therapist and general, generic therapist?","I asked my PCP a few months ago for a recommendation to see a therapist specializing in treating issues with gender identity.

I've been going since then, and I feel pretty confident that I want to continue with transition. I have an appointment with an informed consent clinic in a few weeks and I'm pretty excited for it. I'm still nervous, and sometimes very doubtful, but ultimately excited.

What's been bothering me is it feels like my therapist hasn't really done anything. It feels like he hasn't really help me come to any conclusions, just acting as a sounding board for me to talk about what's been bothering me. I was hoping he would reveal some deep insight and help give me confidence with my decisions. But I haven't gotten that. It seems like most of the time I'm just coming up with conclusions on my own throughout the week, then sharing them over a one hour session with him.

What's more is it doesn't feel like he really knows _that_ much about gender related issues. It's making me wonder, maybe this guy isn't a ""true"" gender therapist. Maybe there are other therapists with way more expertise and understanding of this field. The only reason I'm working with this one is because he was recommended to me by my doctor.

And that makes me nervous. Maybe I am making the wrong decision moving forward and having the right therapist would've helped me see that. I don't really want to switch therapists though and start over from four months ago, but I will if there's something huge I might be missing.

So my questions are: What special insight will a gender therapist provide that a generic therapist won't? Is there some deep understanding that I'm missing out on? How can you tell the difference between the two? Do all therapists work this way, just act as a sounding board for you to discuss conclusions you're coming up with yourself?"

Dustman28,asktransgender,HRT and Weight Loss,"I'm 28 AMAB and for the last year or so I have gained weight and lost a bit of muscle mass due to naturally lowered testosterone levels. I normally wouldn't be too worried, but it has made my physically demanding job more difficult. I have already cut back on unhealthy eating and calories, and I have picked up my exercise regime. However, the low hormonal levels have slowed my metabolism and made it hard. That's not to mention some memory and libido issues also attached.

I have had a couple of people warning me that HRT would further increase weight gain and muscle loss, but I feel that I might actually lose weight from the increased metabolism and more energy would help me maintain the strength I have. (I am far from a bodybuilder.)

Attraction, as I view it can be physical or psychological, like being attracted to people who experience trans identity, or being attracted to the idea of a trans couple.

I know its a bit of a sketchy question and can be seen as bad, but I find it interesting."
Alexis_Melody,asktransgender,Depressing blood test results...,"I got blood test results back today after months of being on 4 mg estrogen a day that I started back in April.

My estrogen levels are only at 72.1 pg/mL

Also my testosterone is way too high even though I'm on 200 mg of spiro a day. I'm at 222 ng/dL.

Also back when I was on 2 mg of estrogen a day my Prolactin levels were about 11 ng/mL. Now after being on 4 mg of estrogen a day my Prolactin levels are at 21.7 ng/mL.

Had brief concern about that before I realized the levels saying I was too high were for male ranges.

Either way that still doesn't fix my levels being wonky..."

LoveIinus,asktransgender,Continue laser hair removal (IPL) or go full electrolysis?,"Hi, so I've been doing facial hair removal for 4 months now. 4 laser sessions and a couple of electrolysis sessions in between. 

I've stopped doing laser because when I ran my hands over my face it feels smooth. So they're fine facial hair. Also, I'm able to get my whole face cleared under electrolysis in 30-40 minutes max.

However, I'm at work today and this morning I realised I have some upper lip facial hair and omg no amount of concealer could fix it. I had to present in boymode. I just had my last electrolysis session last Friday. Why does it regrow so fast? I thought once hairs are killed by electrolysis the same follicle will never grow back.

So what now, I'm so confused. Should I go back to laser (IPL in fact) and electrolysis combo or do you think I can go full electrolysis? Also, how often should I go for treatment sessions? "
101-level-ally,asktransgender,Which books and characters did you relate to as a kid with regard to gender?,"I work in an elementary school (equivalent to US Pre-K to 5th Grade) and would like advice on buying age-appropriate works of fiction that deal with gender identity in a progressive, but fairly light-touch way.

Statistically, there's probably a trans kid in this school right now. The religious and social context in which they're living means they may never come out and if they do it's likely I'll never know about it because it'll be long after they've left this school and gone on to other things. I don't know who the kid is, but I know they're probably here somewhere and I have a duty of care to help them. (I also want to help their cis classmates to start thinking about this stuff, so that the Mystery Trans Kid has an easier time later on.)

There are industry recommended books for covering trans issues with little kids, like I Am Jazz and My Princess Boy, but they're probably not a good fit for this school. They're fairly didactic and issues-y. They also don't reflect the context in which my MTK is living or the reactions that they are likely to face from family and peers if/when they come out. The last thing I want is a backlash from religious and conservative parents that stops me from getting resources to kids who need them. I also don't want my MTK to see their own parents having a negative reaction to books about kids just like MTK. That's just going to make MTK feel even more isolated.

So I'm trying a softly, softly approach. I'm prioritising books which are sold as mainstream fiction rather than ""issues"" books. Books that are an established part of the canon and won't raise eyebrows. Books where the contents are not immediately obvious from the cover. Books where the gender stuff is a subplot or plays out through a supporting character. (What I would absolutely kill for, btw, is a kids book where one of the parents or trusted background adults is trans or gender non-conforming in some way. Adult role models are important!)


Already in my stash:

- **The Famous Five** by Enid Blyton. Yes, it's old and it's problematic on a bajillion levels, but it's got an AFAB character who wears male clothes, takes a male name and inhabits a male societal role. George was formative to so many kids throughout the decades, that I think the Famous Five still earn their place on the shelves.

- **The Turbulent Term of Tike Tyler** by Gene Kemp. This is basically the ideal book for my purposes. The cover's completely unassuming. The book itself is a fun read and the main character is never given a pronoun until the very last page, the reader is just left to assume Tike's gender. The ending to this one blew my mind as a small child.

- **Bill's New Frock** by Anne Fine. I freaking love Anne Fine's books (Go read The Granny Project. Seriously, just do it.) and this one works on multiple levels. You've got the basic Freaky Friday sort of plotline with a character who magically wakes up to find everybody treating him like he's always been a girl. You've got the examination of institutional and socially conditioned sexism in a school setting and you've got also got a relatable transman narrative about this kid who knows he's a boy, but nobody around him seems to realise it and how he learns to navigate that.

- **The Boy In The Dress** by David Walliams. I think the ending to this one is kind of not-great, but it's got value as a story examining the way an AMAB character starts to pursue an interest in wearing female clothes and exploring the possibilities of that identity without automatically ceding the aspects he feels connected to within his existing gender identity. Since the author's already known for comedy crossdressing and politically incorrect humor, this one might get a pass from parents who might be up in arms about the same story from a different author.


Are there any other books like this that I can add to my arsenal? Anything that really spoke to you as a child? What should MTK and their classmates be reading now that will help to provide a framework for thinking about this stuff later?

(Also, if I've fucked up any terminology here or you think I'm being a coward for not stocking 'I Am Jazz' go ahead and say so. I'm honestly more waking than woke and sometimes need to be told this shit. I just want to do right by these kids and to pass my performance review. I'm really hoping those aren't mutually exclusive goals!)"

meetmario,asktransgender,"It's driving me nuts. (Sorry, yes, it's a rant)","So, I do things in female mode and my dysphoria grows. Great! I am a trans woman then! All I have to do is risk social stigma, risk the best relationship I have ever had, and earn enough to go through multiple irreversible surgeries, and do training that seems to require a long-term willpower I have never been able to muster in my entire life.

Then I move house. Or I visit my parents, or something else stressful. Or I just wake up in the morning, and I don't really feel like a woman. I still love my painted nails. I still love the shape of my eyebrows, oh so feminine. But I have short, thick, quickly growing gorilla hair on my fingers and arms and shoulders and back and everywhere else you can think of and my perfect brows grow above a fucking forest of deep black beard and below a quickly receding hairline that won't react to rogaine.

And it would all be ok, all of it, if I could just look at myself in the mirror and tell myself ""Even though you don't look like one, you are a woman, and you'll always be a woman, so just get to work to look like you feel."" But today I don't fucking feel like one. Today I feel like a man. And if I could go out with friends or with my girlfriend with clean nails and grown body hair and manly eyebrows, at least I wouldn't care about balding, and I wouldn't feel like a fucking joke every time I see a picture someone takes of me.

I don't know what to do. I suspect I need some things changed but I don't really know. What I know for sure is that at least I looked good as a man when i had a long beard and fuller eyebrows. But that certainty is gone, and there is nothing else to take its place. I look good en femme, but I don't feel ""en femme"" all the time. Not now, not yet or maybe not ever.

waterlillies,asktransgender,HTF do you wire money to these Thai surgeons?,"I've been talking to Dr. Chettawut trying to reserve a surgery date. I have the money for the deposit, but I'm having the worst time getting it to him. Anyone who's seen him. How did you manage to wire the money?

I'm in the US. I've never needed to do an international wire transfer, so I never noticed my bank doesn't do them. I tried looking at other services, but it's all becoming a giant quagmire.

I signed up for Transferwise before realiz ing Chettawut said not to use that service. 

I signed up for OFX, but they're taking ages to verify my documents. When I tried adding Chettawut's bank/contact details, they called to interrogate me about why I'm sending the money. Ultimately, they said they wouldn't allow me to send any money to Dr. Chettawut until I sent them a detailed invoice listing what I'm paying for...

I then tried Western Union. That was a complete horror show from start to finish. I thought I'd sent the money, only to be called a day later and told they'd cancelled it because it ""fit the profile"" of an advance fee scam.

How did you do it? Are there any other options I haven't thought of? The only one I can think of that I haven't tried was opening a new bank account at one of those megabanks. Ironically, I thought that would take too long.

They gave me a seven day deadline to reserve the day, and it's now day 14. At this point I'm wondering if this is going to happen at all. I wish they'd accepted credit cards, I could charge the entire damn thing to my card and be done with it."

I don't think I'll really have an issue with this, so this is not my worry for right now.

My only main worry to be honest, is the costs. My family is broke, and we basically live on food stamps and the minuscule amount of money my mom makes from her job isn't enough leftover to even buy anything extra with. Considering that I'm 14, I believe I can go on blockers and possibly even go through with HRT. I'm unsure what I was told before when I posted on here. Regardless, my medical options are rather bleak. I'm covered by Florida Medicaid as far as I know. I don't know a gigantic bunch about the full details about what I can do cost-wise or how much it will cost me, but that's really my main concern.

GabiCap,asktransgender,"Came out to my priest today (first ""verbal"" coming out)","Background: The last few months (well, ever since I started to get serious in exploring this side of me) I have been attending the local Episcopal parish since the denomination tends to be LGBT friendly. I am born and raised Catholic and am pretty conservative myself so there was a lot of self loathing.

Anyways, I set up a meeting with the priest here because if I'm gonna make the leap to join them, I want to know if I'll be accepted. So I started off with more theological and historical questions before saying, ""Well, my biggest thing is....""

I told her I'm bisexual and have recently come to accept that I have gender dysphoria and was wondering if there was still a place. I used that phrasing because I still haven't said, ""I am transgender"" out loud yet. Hell, I've only said I have dysphoria out loud twice now.

Her response? YES!!!

And my favorite line of the meeting: ""Is it hard, because of your background, to think it's possible that God just doesn't give a crap?"" And how important it is to be my authentic self.

So she is supportive (though I told her I am unsure yet if I'll act on anything soon in terms of hormones).

And now, I spent the day feeling like something has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel lighter. And I have no idea why. It's not like I've grown up in this parish or even this town or state. But I feel more relieved than when I texted it to my future step sister.

So now I am on the verge of tears. Don't know if it's from joy, nervousness, fear, regret. But it's been relaxing after that meeting.

Though one thing that I still worry about. Am I jumping the gun? I don't see myself starting hormones for months, maybe even for another year. And it felt so strange saying I have dysphoria that I couldn't help but hear a voice in my head saying, ""Do you? Do you really need to be a woman to feel more like yourself or be happy?"" Maybe I shouldn't say anything until that last question is a definitive yes."

People have noticed around me and I have had friends jokingly ask if I am a woman and even had a friend suggest I should transition, my response to this person wasn't ""no because I enjoy being a man"" it was ""no because I am worried I wouldn't be cute"". At this point I seriously started questioning myself and it pretty much brings me to present day. I am worried that I am just fixating on this and that I am actually just being crazy but a part of me thinks that I may seriously be a woman. I never had obvious dysphoria as a child and I don't know if it is what I am experiencing. I have struggled with severe depression and low mood for basically my entire life and have recently went on to meds for it, but now I am wondering if that was a sign of dysphoria. I know some people don't put things together until very late in life but I am worried that I am just lying to myself. I have never liked my body and have memories of talking to one of my best friends about how amazing it would be to be able to be a girl when I was fairly young but maybe that was just curiosity.

The other thing is that I have seen complications that can occur and that it won't be as near as sensitive as a real vagina and you can't get stimulated in the same ways. Some cis girls said in a conversation that that they got their hips shaking from just getting it licked/touched which obviously won't work with the neovagina or getting as wet as a real one will probably not be the case either.

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,I am trapped inside my own mind,"I am absolutely out of my mind.

I've been questioning for three months so far and I've reached the point where I realize I have no idea what I truly want because I don't even know who I am in the sense that I am completely introverted and I now cannot trust a single thought that I have about the subject of me being transgender because I am convinced I am completely invalid by usually the SMALLEST things and the only confidant I have said I should probably focus on getting some friends, then giving me a motivational type speech but that really isn't helping at all.

All I know for sure is that:

* I like to see more feminine features in my face and hair.

* The only reason I started working out and eating healthy is because I started questioning.

* Cis people usually don't question their gender identity for months at a time.

* I don't FEEL male nor do I really want to, I've never been feminine but I've never really been masculine and when I have been, I never really liked it.

* I imagine cis people wouldn't get giddy while looking at SRS clinic websites (Yeah, my mind really can't explain that so.. I don't know what to think of that...)

* If I were to be reborn or have a different body, it would be female, why I don't know but I am pretty sure it would be much better over a male one.

* I can't trust myself if I actually feel dysphoria or if I am making it up, I WISH it were intense and obvious and I know how STUPID it sounds but if it were like that, it would be more like a yellow brick road where I would know where to go instead of trying to find a grass green golf ball that could be anywhere in a golf course, including the ponds and excluding the sand bunkers.

* I feel ABSOLUTELY invalidated by the fact that I didn't know since I was like three or something and it's only worse because I am reading a lovely made LGBT-type comic but I am absolutely hit in the heart strings when I am reminded all of the trans characters knew or had strong feelings when they were young, so it makes me question why I am even questioning...

* I've read a multitude of trans resources and such and I find that I always put myself into a wave of denial after I feel any sort of progress.

* I've been on this subreddit for two months and only started posting about half a month ago, yet my feelings from my different posts would have you see that I am almost all over the place, can all these feelings really go around this fast like a questioning cocktail?

* I can't even trust what I just said.


Has anyone had a severe feeling of not being sure of basically anything and everything?

What the hell is possibly even driving these thoughts... I can't just let them go but I can't clearly see if I am just faking it in my mind or I am just REALLY good at denial, the last thing I want to find out is that I am using me being transgender as some type of mental crutch for another problem..

As well, I don't have any clue if these feelings will be like this next week, I might be over it and going back to guesstimating what HRT would do for me OR I'll be in even worse condition. Do I need to talk to someone about it all?

I know it's a lot to ask but I really need some inputs on all of these points, be honest. I am not happy to be in such a confused state."

windlep7,asktransgender,Please just let me die.,"I'm sorry I know I've posted stuff like this before, youre probably tired of hearing from me.  I know I need a counsellor, but it's the weekend and everywhere is shut.  I don't want to ring the Samaritans  because I don't feel comfortable talking on phone with them.  I just really need someone to tell me I'll be ok right now.

I'm shaking and wailing and crying so much I just want it all to stop but it won't.

My parents are fundementalist christians, who don't accept me as gay.  They say they still love me but still oppose gay marriage, etc.  They'll never accept me as trans and I don't think I can live without them.  I'm not dependent on them but I still need them.

Coming out as trans will hurt them like nothing else.  They think I'm their little boy promised to them by God. Even though I know that's crazy, they believe it with all their heart and it will crush them.  I don't know if I could live with myself.

I don't have many friends.  I have Aspergers.  I have a few, who might be accepting, but there's a guy I know who makes me feel normal.  He calls me his ""brother"".  I don't think he'd accept me as his ""sister"", and it will crush me.  I wish so much that I was like him - normal, good looking, social, straight and cis.  But I never will be and I don't know how to accept it.

They'll all abandon me and go on with their lives being happy while I whither in despair.  Even those who stick around will see me as a freak.

Then there's the issue of passing.  I'm 31, my nose is far to wide and too masculine.  My brow is like a caveman.  I can't afford surgery because I work in retail.  I don't want to walk down the street having abuse hurled at me and have people be too embarrassed to be seen with me.

There's no way I'd try to transition in retail, so I'm trying to get into IT, but so far I haven't had any luck.  Even so my work colleagues would probably think I'm a freak and want nothing to do with me.

I've tried looking into Buddhism to try and help me become more calm and resilient, but it's still difficult and I'm wondering what it's all for.  Why do I keep pushing on and making an effort, when I could just end it.  All my suffering would stop.

kevin23i,asktransgender,Can I stop feeling like I'm transgender?,"Basically, I was born a female. But ever since as long as I can remember, I've always done boy things. When I was little, all my friends were boys, I played with nerf guns not barbies, I had crushed on girls, I cried when  had to put dresses on, I watched ben 10 and not whatever girls my age watched etc. My family all called me a tomboy, and decided it was only a phase.

As I grew older, I started doing more girly things, since it was only natural; I am a girl, after all right? I wore girl clothes, starting hanging out with girls, but I always felt uncomfortable. I just couldn't figure out what was wrong. Then, last year I developed a raging crush on a girl. I'm talking super infatuation, crazy smitten. I became really upset, but then decided I was just gay. Easy enough right? I came out to a few friends, everything was fine and dandy. But something kept telling me that wasn't all.

I decided to cut my hair short, dress more like a boy. It made me feel really happy, but it didn't last long. I became super confused, but decided I was just a butch lesbian. But for some reason, the term made me feel SUPER uncomfortable. I just let it go, though. I started hanging out with all my old guy friends again, and acting more like myself (so more boyish again). I was pretty okay with it, then I realised something. Me dressing like a boy and having short hair and acting like a boy only made people think I was a girl acting weird. And that made me really upset and uncomfortable and mad. My guy friends didn't see my like one of them- I was still a girl to them.

I started getting all these thoughts that I was trans, but I kept making excuses, pushing them away. I thought it was unnatural, there is no scientific or logical explanation for it, I'm clearly a girl, I would be a freak, It was insane, It was a mental illness. I just refused to even consider the idea.

Fast forward to today, and I simply can't deny it anymore. I refuse to accept it too. I just wish there was a way I could be normal, and stop feeling this way. Each day that passes the feeling gets more and more intense, and i don't understand how this could be natural. I find myself wishing I could just be a lesbian because that would be so much easier. I hate the idea of being transgender, and the idea people will see me as some kid trying to be ""unique"" and going on tumblr being all ""positive"" or whatever bullshit. I just want to be a normal kid

I just want advice and help about how to deal with this, because every day I feel so uncomfortable with myself. I'm also afraid that even if I do transition, the feeling will follow me around forever. I just wish I could be normal. Help?

stasisorchange,asktransgender,Am I really transgender? I need brutally honest expert opinions.,"UPDATE:

After reading everyone's responses here and looking over most of the other recent posts in this sub, it looks like this: either I'm a man suffering from severe depression, or I'm a trans woman suffering from subtle but pervasive gender dysphoria. I truly have no idea which. I never really had the whole ""I'm not a boy!"" experience that most successfully transitioned trans women tend to have had - quite the opposite, in fact. I always did know that there was something ""a bit off"" about me (I figured that one out when I was 3), but by and large I enjoyed boy stuff and boy activities, and felt comfortable as male. However, this could have easily been caused by my childhood tendency to unquestioningly accept whatever I was told regardless of competing facts (for example, abandoning religion, another thing I unquestionably accepted as a child, went hand in hand with the romantic rejections and rising depression that made me who I am today). On the other hand, by my junior year in college, I was adamantly certain that my sexuality and sexual preferences were those of a bisexual woman, not a straight man. This could just be skewed, though, by my burgeoning dissatisfaction with my own subpar and nearly sensation-less sex organs. I could go on back and forth like this all day without accomplishing anything, but I'll spare you the trouble, since the unanimous vote from everyone who posted here was to go see an expert. I didn't really want to - all the therapy and psych sessions I've had in the past were, at best, a waste of money, and at worst, led to a misdiagnosis of Aspergers (when I actually have Social Anxiety Disorder), a misdiagnosis that caused severe stress and self-loathing before I found out that it wasn't actually correct. However, against my better judgment, you've all convinced me that I need advice not from someone who's walked the path before me, but from someone trained to make these kinds of diagnoses. 

I'm going to go meet with a therapist who specializes in trans &amp; lgbtq issues, and let them figure out whether my brain, my thoughts, and my identity are ultimately male or female. I'm not sure how it'll go, but fingers crossed that I'm a trans woman, because gender dysphoria is treatable, and I'll actually get to live a happy life for the next couple of decades - doubly-important because if I'm just a man who can't cope with modern life, the light at the end of the tunnel is a muzzle flash.

If I'm actually trans, I'll keep you all posted with how my transition goes. If not, well ...

ORIGINAL TEXT:

This post is vast, dark, and if you printed it out you could use the sheets to wallpaper a small cathedral. Apologies in advance ... but I really need the help, so I hope you read through it anyway.

I never really thought about gender identity much until recently (I'm 25 M, btw), or identity at all, really. When I was a kid, people would ask me ""who do you want to be when you grow up?"" and I'd say ""me"", not understanding how I could be anything else. Recently, however, I've been reviewing myself in more detail, and I'm genuinely uncertain whether or not I'm actually male, mentally. So I'm reaching out to all of you here, the only experts I know who aren't a) condescending, b) being paid to counsel me, or c) both. Hopefully you can help me figure out who I really am, because thus far, I sure as hell can't.

Some background. I'm a 25 year old white man (6'1""), slightly chubby and passably attractive, only child to liberal and intelligent - but overbearing and overprotective - parents. I've lived in North Carolina my entire life, and aside from the bigoted lawmakers in Raleigh, I really like it here. I've always been intelligent, into nerdy stuff, and highly - but selectively - social: I've never had more than 2-3 close friends at a time, but tend to want to spend every waking minute I can with them. In part because of my nerdy, naive nature (and partly because of my sheltering parents) I've never been good at making new friends; new friends tend to find me instead. This caused a lot of problems for me in middle and high school, especially in regards to the clumsy attempts at dating and relationships that everyone goes through - no one I ever expressed interest in, regardless of social class or physical appearance, was ever interested in me, and this ultimately caused the depression and anxiety issues I still suffer from today. I attended a large college, but didn't do much to meet people - I simply attached myself to my roommate's circle of friends and gave up on dating/relationships, deciding (erroneously, as it turns out) that a life spent alone was better than constant rejection. After graduating with a nearly useless degree in 2013, I returned home and moved in with my parents just in time for my father to die of cancer. I spent the next three years pissing my life away taking college courses in various different subjects that I had no talent for and doing menial grunt-work office jobs. Ultimately, of course, the college courses got too difficult and the grunt-work jobs drowned me in so much unnecessary policy and procedure that I ended up quitting. At this point, I learn to stand up to my well-meaning but controlling mother, move out and get my own place (with a last bit of financial assistance from her), begin trying to find a more meaningful job, and get back into dating. Moving out and setting up some online contract writing/editing/proofing gigs ended up being good decisions, but dating was, as before, an unmitigated disaster. 

So for summary, I'm 25, on the cusp of true independence, with few close friends, only one meaningful family member, and no effective chance of ever finding someone for a romantic relationship, and this last bit has really led to me questioning my worth as a man. I've always been clumsy, awkward (both verbally and physically), and weak (for a man. I can't lift 100lbs). I'm also too tall and if we're going to be brutally honest, my tiny 4"" penis has always been a source of great shame. I look around me, at all the different men I consider friends or acquaintances, and they don't deal with any of these problems. They're not all smooth-talking Casanovas or well-endowed gym fanatics, by any means, but they've all dated, had sex, kept fit, and learned to talk to people they don't know, male or female, without making a fool of themselves. I've got serious inferiority issues from this - I'm not competitive, exactly (I don't strive to be ""better"" than others or to ""beat"" them), but I can't stand to be looked down upon, seen as lesser, inferior, or in any way lose respect. I just want to be equal to my fellows, but I'm afraid that will simply never happen as a man, and this jealous inferiority complex has ended up affecting my outlook on all things male. These days, I'm predisposed to dislike someone I meet simply because they're male, predisposed to dislike things like sports and beer simply because they're male-associated, and even things like male actions during sex (the repetitive hip thrusts and so forth) kind of disgust me when I imagine myself doing them simply because of how masculine, how brutish, and how aggressive they are. There's a lot of cognitive dissonance going on. I don't hate my male friends (although I do like the less-masculine ones more these days), I don't hate myself for being male, and I don't really begrudge men for acting like aggressive emotionally-stunted thugs (usually. The domestic violence incident that happened in the apartment below mine this week, which I had to listen to through the paper thin floor, just about drove me insane). It's all very confusing. But anyways...

A year or so ago, laden down with depression, seething with resentment, and burning with shame, I just so happened to put my acting and writing talents to work writing and running D&amp;D campaigns for the benefit of my nerdy friends, and during these story-rich interactive role-playing sessions (for the campaigns I write are far more about character interaction than they are about combat or gameplay), I just so happened, without much forethought, to write a female character based upon my more feminine traits and attitudes, who accompanied my friends throughout the story - and I found that I greatly, vastly, and radically preferred her to myself. I'd roleplayed as female characters before, of course - even as a kid, when my (male) friends and I would play video games together, I'd usually pick female characters, because that just felt more ""right somehow (not that I ever shared this with them) - but this character I had written not to act but simply to be ended up changing my life in unexpected ways. I found myself acting a bit more feminine, empathizing more with women, and even adopting a higher pitched and lighter voice when I was happy and among friends. Even as my real-life depression worsened noticeably each day, I would cheer up almost instantly whenever we'd play D&amp;D simply because I had a chance to be someone I actually enjoyed being. 

It might seem so far that I, with my distaste and shame for being male and my surprise and joy at roleplaying a female ""me"", that I might actually be a candidate for gender transition. However, I'm by nature a colossal coward, and I've got some serious concerns about transitioning:

1) How much of my current attitudes could actually be attributed to any true sense of gender dysphoria? Maybe it's all just the byproduct of life's unending series of disappointments and a decade-long case of depression that is rapidly reaching suicidal-grade? (more on that later).

2) Where will I find the money? If I decided to embrace the idea of becoming a trans woman, I wouldn't personally want to go halfway (nothing wrong with those who choose to keep their own voices, genitals, etc, but I'd want the complete experience). The price tag for not only a lifetime of hormone therapy but also facial feminization surgery, vocal cord alteration, tracheal shave (if needed - I don't have much of an adam's apple), electric hair removal for face, chest, genitals, and eventually arms and legs, breast augmentation (if hormones didn't create enough growth there on their own), vaginoplasty, and any other significant procedures I might have forgotten (there are so many - how did all of you trans women remember them all?) will be upwards of $50,000 at best - probably twice that not including monthly cost for hormones. I could maybe afford a quarter of this on my own, and although my family contains several highly wealthy people who could easily make up the difference, there's no guarantee they'd be willing to help someone like me, or even if they'd still associate with a trans family member. And, the issue is, this stuff isn't optional for me. I could effectively be a recluse for a year during the middle of transition - I can work from home enough to pay the rent, and most of my day-to-day interaction with friends is online these days, since I moved two hundred miles away from where I grew up, but I am not willing to spend much time in the public eye while I can't pass as either male or female - that's where most of the violence, discrimination and brutality happens. I'm perfectly willing to lose what small scraps of male privilege I do have if being female means that I'd be happier, but I'm not willing to face the far harsher discrimination that being openly and visibly trans invites, so I need the procedures. 

3) Leading in from 2), how bad is the recovery time from all these different procedures? If I actually am trans at heart, do I need to go ahead and brace myself to spending weeks at a time trapped in a hospital bed, or is most of this stuff overnight/outpatient with a week or two of checkups and pain meds?

4) Just how badly does being a fully-transitioned (with GRS) trans woman hurt your chances with potential partners if you're upfront abut it? I currently am a straight* man (*but given my recent distaste for male sex acts, it might be easier to say I'm an in-between queer person with the body of a man and the sexual preferences of a bisexual woman - confusing, I know!), but I imagine that post-transition, I'd be a bisexual woman who'd be open to sex with either gender, but strongly prefer women for romantic relationships. Since I'd be okay with being upfront with potential partners about my trans status (even putting it on the front page of dating sites and the like), and wouldn't date until after GRS, to keep things simpler (assuming anyone was even interested, that is. My life has been absolutely dismal for romance up to this point), are there really many nerdy, laid-back women out there willing to date trans people?

5) Okay, this is the big one. Hormonal effects on the mind. I know that some stuff, like intelligence, sense of humor, etc, stays the same, but I'm worried that if I go through with it, I might lose some of my interests, experience personality changes unrelated to happiness and self-confidence, or otherwise lose track of my current values as the values of who I'm becoming overwrite them. Will I still have a talent for writing and acting? Will I lose interest in the D&amp;D stories I've created? Will I stop caring about hiking, or instrumental music, or video game nights with my friends? In essence, will I keep what few bits of my masculine self that I do enjoy, or will I lose it all and become a completely new person who just happens to have a quarter-century of ""some guy's"" memories in her head?

I really need to know the answers to these questions. I don't expect all of you who read this (if anyone does) to have all the answers, but hopefully across the depth and breadth of this subreddit, you'll be able to help me figure out what to do. Especially considering...

...the stakes. I mentioned before that depression, that ever-present companion who ushered me out of the black depths of adolescence and into the crushing abyss of adulthood, has steadily worsened as I've aged, and is now reaching the point where suicide is on the table. To me, though, suicide isn't some kneejerk emotional response to traumatic situations - it's the last, most desperate resort of someone who has exhausted every option for building a tolerable future. I say it's on the table now not because I WANT to die (I don't!), but because I'm almost out of options to make a life for myself that I can be happy with. I find no joy in work (work sucks), or in solitude (all the entertainment in the world doesn't make loneliness feel better), or in dedication to faiths or causes (I'm too cynical for that). The only happy life I can imagine is one where I spend most of my free time with friends and a romantic partner - as someone I can be proud of and happy as. As a man, I can only achieve the ""friends"" part of that - I'm not proud of being a naive male mind in a third-rate male body, and history has taught me that trying to date (as a man) is utterly hopeless for me. So, if I stay male, I'll probably end up dead by my own hand. However, I'm a huge coward, and it might very well take years more of soul-crushing loneliness and hellish depression before I finally have the nerve to end it. If I transition, however, I might find that being a woman is perfect for me - or I might run out of money and be unable to finish the surgeries and pass in public, or find that being a woman is no better than being a man, or that I'm just as off-putting, just as awkward, and just as uninteresting as before, and find myself bereft of friends and romance - and if this happens, I might end up dead far faster than if I simply waited to see how long I can last as a man. When you're on the brink, but don't want to die, you tend to cling to every precious moment of life you have left. Given that I don't know enough about myself to be certain one way or the other, I need wiser heads to help me decide what to do.

So this is what it all boils down to. Many of you have lived through transition, and most of you who haven't know people who have. You all know what types of person should transition (and what types shouldn't). You all know what the process is like, both good and bad. You've all (hopefully) read my Great Wall of Words, and have an understanding of who I am and where I'm coming from. So my request to you is: help me decide! Don't just post three word answers or a link to the local suicide hotline. Post thoughtful, meaningful, brutally honest responses to my questions and help me discover who I ultimately should be - because I no longer know."

Petra-fied,asktransgender,I'm nervous about my emotions and I don't really know where else to ask,"Ok hey everyone. By all accounts my transition has gone super smoothly so far. I've basically loved any minute, and in 2.5 months I've gone from starting appointments about this to getting a full wardrobe, and with a little hair work and a padded bra, more or less passing in public and being comfortable enough to be out there like that, even alone sometimes (not always, I am a nervous person).

My mum has mostly been the one to help me do this, she's a doctor and an... extremely motivated person, she's help me find a lot of things, even a lot of the doctors I originally went to see. She's not running my transition or anything, and she's extremely good at listening, it's just that she has this amazing gut sense of what will work.

Ok cut forwards to a week ago. I got really sick. I'd already had this cold-like thing with a cough, but then I caught the works. I got gastro, dizzyness, bad sleeps and dehydration for 2 nights, but then I started to get better. Then 2 nights ago I started to get bad muscle pain and night before last I got a horrible viral rash all over my body.

I'm not trying to look for too much sympathy, the point is I'm tired, run down and have had bad sleeps and I'm pretty emotionally exhausted from the amount of work on transition I've been doing.

Here's what I'm here to ask about. The last... 2? days at various times I've felt less of a girl. Not more of a boy or anything, just... less. At the same time as this this morning, I woke up and had a hard time feeling emotions. I still do a bit, and it's been... 2 hours?

I'm probably just tired or something, but I want to check because I'm a bit worried and I wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences.

Sorry for the overly long post.

EDIT: Forgot to mention- when first waking up my brain used my dead name and used an image of pre-transition me when referring to myself in a thought. I found this a bit worrying too. I know a lot of this is probably stupid, but I'm honestly worried and I want to make sure what other people think."

Exchanged numbers and that was it. It was not until later that night she told me she trans and had no surgery down below. To be honest I didn't care so much, I was more in shock at the fact of just how into here I was and I had no idea. I replied to her saying that this was new to me but I really don't care. 
Since then we have met up pretty much every night, doing normal date type stuff and never had we talked about her being trans. Of course when I went home I was googling my fingers off trying just trying to educate myself. To me it was a total non issue, there would be moments I'd forget she was. This was all up until the other night when we were at my place and got a bit physical. Right before hand she told me that she was not going to hide anything and that she was proud of her body as it was. All I said was ok and we continued on eventually having sex. To me it was great, she is by far the best looking girl I have ever had sex with. Of course things were a bit different, and I was quite suprized because I could tell she was very turned on... genital wise. We have hung out since and we are both cool and enjoying ourselves. I have a lot of respect for her especially since she was very forward in regards to sex and her situation. My question is that to me this obviously different. I assume I will get used to everything and find it less and less different. However from the vibes I get and from what she has said she seems to be the type not to hold anything back sex wise. I can tell she is slowly easing into it and desires sexual stimulation. She has already mentioned never would she be the ""top"" but she tells me other things are enjoyable. I of course want her to feel good and be satisfied so I am opening up more then ever. She is great and even though I may be pushing my comfort zone I think it will be worth it. Any advice? Id like to make things work with her.

villescrubs,asktransgender,How do you deal with pesky permanent 5 o clock shadow?,Without electrolysis and laser I mean. Anything to do makeup wise?
PennyLisa,asktransgender,Pain-free electro.,"So I just discovered a really excellent way of blocking pain for electro - get a facial nerve block. I got a submental block and got my entire chin cleared without any pain at all! You can also get an infra-orbital block for the upper lip.

You can show your doctor [this article](http://www.emdocs.net/facial-nerve-blocks/) that goes over it. 

I suggest only doing one of either bilateral submental blocks, or bilateral infraorbital blocks. If you get all four blocked at the same time, both your lips are numb and you'll dribble and could bite your lip accidentally.

baggesparre,asktransgender,Confused. Where and how to get started figuring it out?,"Hello.
I am a male (mtf?) in my mid twenties attending university in Denmark.

I have been having thoughts, desires, wishes, no idea how to describe it? Of wanting to be a girl for several years now, but have no idea where to start.

I have been trying to find resources/help on the internet, but there barely is anything in Danish. Anything online seem to be very old or either abandoned/rarely updated that I got no idea where to go or where I can ask for help or how to get started.

Do I go to my normal doctor? Do I see a therapist, if so what kind and where do I find some that can help me? Who do I talk to and how do I get in contact with them?
Anything I find seem to mostly be about the United States or some other county, so I got no idea what to really do.

I have only heard that things in Denmark go through the Soxiologisk klinik, or something along those lines, but have no idea where to really start. Do I go directly to them or somewhere else first?

Since I really do not know if I am transgender, I want to get some advice and talk with some people who can guide me on the right way to figuring things out.
I basicly have a lot of uncertainty and want to figure things out before I make any decisions.

It would be really helpful, if there are any trans people from Denmark here, who could give any input on what to do and how to get started. I live in Odense if it helps.
Other people are welcome to help.

Also how does one get started with things like clothes and hair? 
What is the best way to buying female clothes, preferable some androgynous clothes that can make me feel somewhat feminine, without really looking out of place?

Thanks in advance for anything.

TL:DR Confused about what I really with lots of uncertainty. Can’t really find anything in Danish and now turn elsewhere for help, on how and where to get started figuring things out.

queersparrow,asktransgender,Question for people with depression,"Been thinking about this since the post about 'trans broken arm syndrome' and hoping for a more experienced perspective than my own.

I've been dealing with depression and dysphoria for a good long while now, and not medically addressing either for various reasons. I've started giving serious consideration to both antidepressants and HRT but I've been expecting to do one before the other. I'm tempted to try HRT and see what happens to my depression, because I'm not sure how much, if any, of my depression might be resolved by HRT. But after reading more about the response of medical professionals to trans people who want to talk about mental health issues, I'm now wondering if trying to address depression once on HRT might be harder than if I have proof that my depression predates my use of hormone replacement. Anyone have experience or thoughts that might shed insight on what issue to tackle first?

VinylScratch01,asktransgender,SRS Surgeons,"I have recently started hormones and my therapist recommended looking into SRS surgeons, see what their requirements are, what the wait time is, so I have plenty of time in advance to prepare.

So I decided to post here, see if you all can help me with sorting through surgeons and your opinions of them

What I am looking for in SRS are these things listed from most to least importance +Sensitivity, Self Lubrication, Appearance, Recovery Length. I think these are all the factors/results. So does anyone have a good list/recommendation? They have to be in the US BTW, my mother refuses to let me go overseas for surgery

ReimiS,asktransgender,!UPDATE! My Passport Drama is finally over!,"Previous topics.

https://redd.it/5p1kyr (Welp, my Passport wasn't approved)

https://redd.it/5swsbz (Has anyone gotten their passport approved since Trump was inaugurated?)

https://redd.it/5t0mry (The ""expedited"" Passport service is just a request, they can ""choose"" not to honor it. I was told this by a supervisor just now.)


As of today, I have my Passport. Nearly 7 weeks of drama, back and forth with the State Department, and zero proper feedback I finally found out the problem. There wasn't a phone number and address for the clinic on the letterhead. That was the big issue keeping it from being completed, and nobody knew to tell me that util I complained on here and got contacted by the Reddit Rep and they got me in touch with someone that could help. Once I got the phone call, I had the problem fixed within an hour and my passport was in the mail the very next day.

So yeah, I'm legally female now, I have an ID that matches my new name and correct gender, and I can finally breathe. I was so stressed coming hope from work today, worried that something might still be wrong, maybe it would still say M on it... I actually hesitated to open it and look. When I did though, holy shit what a relief. I ended up laying down for a nap because of how relieved I was, and it was so restful.

I can finally continue my legal transition, the biggest hurdle I have faced is finally over. I'm surrounded by people who accept me, my job looks to be secure, and I'm just... wow... I can't believe how far I've come in 15 months since coming out... what a ride! Time to get all my credit cards, accounts and other odds and ends updated, then the big one, getting my work info updated and finally going full time! 

I'm so close now, and I thank everyone on Reddit who has helped me along the way!"
feelinqueer,asktransgender,"Tricky job+transitioning position, advice?","Hello, I'm MtF and I'm going to start HRT and working towards socially transitioning in about 3 months (shortly after the spring semester) but I am unemployed and going to college currently. I have no income whatsoever and I am living with my supportive family. While they are supportive we are also poor and I will have to pay for everything that insurance (assuming I still have insurance from my biodad who still doesn't know yet, but will once I start) doesn't cover in terms of all my appointments for blood tests, meds, etc. I also live in Texas so that's a negative right there as far as all of that is concerned.

In other words, I will need to get a job to afford medically transitioning. But I will also need a job that I will be able to hopefully start socially transitioning while still working there. Which is really tricky, because say I manage to find a job that has trans inclusive insurance benefits or something I feel like starting a job as boymode then very quickly coming on as trans to my employer could go rough for me. But if I start out as saying that I am trans it will still be tricky. Mostly because I am still a good ways out from passing (assuming I ever pass). I'm, 6'2"" and I used to do bodybuilding and powerlifting and I've only stopped that for a few months so I am still pretty big and my voice isn't there yet.

So I don't really know what to do as far as this all goes. The way I see it I have a few options:

1. I could start the job, start hormones, but stay boymode at work and do my best at socially transitioning outside the workplace until changes are too obvious or I can't stand the dysphoria anymore. At which point I come out at work and see how it goes and if it goes badly I just leave and get a new job as myself aka no longer boymode.
2. Start the job, then very quickly tell my employer that I am trans and that I am starting to transition and would appreciate it if this was respected and implemented at work (as in my new name, pronouns, etc.) and see how it goes.
3. Tell them immediately that I am trans and am starting the transition process and if this is going to be a problem to do with work.

Do any of these options seem like a good road? Are there any other options I have? Are there any companies that you suggest that are trans friendly/have trans inclusive insurance benefits? I can do my own research as far as which employer I look for, but any suggestions would be helpful. I talked to a couple of people earlier about chipotle being good, but I think that would be too stressful of an environment for me right now. I am an extremely capable worker and I have several past bosses who will gladly give there recommendation so that's not a problem, but everything else is... :-/

A very important note is that, like I said, I live in Texas so not exactly the friendliest trans location to be and I fear that even if a companies policy is transgender friendly, that my employer themselves won't be."
FadingObfuscation,asktransgender,Journal: My Love/Hate Relationship with my Magic Bandana.,"I have in my possession a miraculous artifact. Handed down through happenstance from my father to me, lost to time for at least a decade; and recently rediscovered amongst junk and treasures from world travels long passed, and military aspirations not yet achieved.


What appears to be an old, lightly used, Operation Desert Storm camouflage bandana is; in actuality, a mystic relic with entrancing transformative qualities!


When donned, this wondrous item morphs an unsure, unpassing, trans girl into a confident, mysterious, almost too cool to approach cis woman. (Especially when paired with plaid and partially rolled sleeves, or indie music or rock and roll.) Sirs become ma'ams, errands change from enterprises in fear to joys, stares go from uncertainty or hate to the gazes of the beguiled. Its function resounds and is unfailing. I revel in its use.


And yet... I resent this artifact. This artifice. Would that I could experience its effects of my own creation. That I could be released to savor its addicting freedom unadorned, drinking deeply from the splendor of normalcy until it becomes mundane, and held in perpetuity. My face does not and cannot afford me that dream, not without fortunes I do not command.


Thus I am consumed by this headscarf, and I dare not remove it except when compelled by duty. I am loathe to, even alone, for I know as few do the disquiet which lies beneath. Instead, this covering whispers to me, ""Seek others! Embrace my power!"" And I obey. Perhaps in blue, like the unknowable seas, or the endless sky they reflect."

pinkchips,asktransgender,One of the best parts about transition (plus laser) is waking up in the morning and being more feminine than any amount of prep + makeup could ever get me before. (Can we have a gender euphoria sharing topic?) ��,"I'm only like 2.5 months HRT and fortunately got to normal female ranges quickly.  
  
I used to spend an entire evening shaving and putting on makeup.... and if did *all* that plus stood a certain way in the mirror.... maybe I could pretend I looked feminine for a minute.  
  
But now I don't need to pretend anymore... I don't ever feel like a man 'pretending' to be a woman.  I am a woman, her femininity slowly blossoming and growing by the day.  
  
I look into the mirror and see an undeniable cuteness taking hold, and when I smile it looks so adorable it makes me smile even more.  *I like myself*, and everyone else is noticing too and commenting on how much I am smiling now.  
  
No amount of makeup could have done this... and not to mention the smooth and girlish body and slowly expanding hips and nips.  I used to be so scared of my shoulders and how big they were, but even those are shrinking.  Sports bras that made me look like a freak a few months ago now look alright.  
  
And I'm so calm and happy.  I looked at my backyard today like an 8-year old might.  My brain is breaking lots of old connections and making new ones, and the world seems filled with such possibility.  
  
HRT was the best thing that ever happened to me, and you know what?  I don't miss being masculine or a man... not one bit!  Sometimes I feel like a ""tough chick"" but never do I wish to be a man on testosterone again.  ��  And I realize that all those years I never really did.... I just knew that's what society expected and I couldn't bear to face the judgement of society once I shed that false mask.  
  
But society has been accepting too!  Girls I've known for years as acquaintances have suddenly become confidants and friends, and the amount of new people I'm meeting and friends I'm making is staggering.  
  
This is the best, and I seriously hope others who are on the edge questioning themselves can get here as soon as possible too.  Any other early transitioners have any euphoria to share?"

I obviously want the fat in the right places so when does the body switch to the female fat distribution or how long does this change happen?

The big thing is that may sound really stupid is that I feel like I need to be pretty. I mean it obviously feels great having a really feminine body, showing people that trans can be feminine and sexy is something I would want especially the ones that are currently talking shit on trans, I love revealing/tight/sexy clothes, I could be more slutty, extrovert and show off my body which is probably the biggest reason why I want this as my personality is slutty. 

I know that because I am trans it''s very unrealistic and I am damned to never have the life that would make me truly happy. But is it maybe possible to achieve something like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQI5FrOjC4y/)?

Just a fair warning...

Anyways, I'm an in-the-closet trans person, male wanting to be female. I hate my own body, I wish I had a vagina, I wish I had boobs, I wish I had a smaller structure, et cetera. Just—I wish I was a girl.

I *understand* being gender fluid, I guess, if we're talking about the variant that means you hate your penis one day and like it the next. Chronic gender dysphoria? I'd like to see the scientific community come up with something to validate it, but it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch. 

But everything else is a mystery for me.

If you're swapping between presenting as a guy and presenting as a girl, but not wanting to change your genitalia, is that not just crossdressing? There's nothing wrong with crossdressing, but I don't see why you'd need to say you're transgender... Because for me, being transgender is a super serious thing that involves hating my *body.* 

But if you're cool with being ambiguous, I feel a little bit offended even... Like you're devaluing the awfulness that comes with my gender dyshporia... A tom boy isn't following social norms, but that doesn't make her a *dude.* And there are plenty of effeminate men out there, but that doesn't mean they're a *women.*

What does being a third gender mean? I don't understand... There isn't a third variant of a human's sex, unless you're considering intersex... But is that what you want then, to have both? Surely not for all of you...

If you're non-binary, what do you want? A venis? A pagina? I-I just don't get it.

I've managed to come out to my close friends, this was relatively easy because they are very accepting people, but the next step to getting me the help I need is to come out to my mother but it's something I'm not only scared to do, but I feel like it will hurt her. You see my brother was diagnosed with a personality disorder a few months back, and he's also somewhat of a furry - that my mum became aware of before he was diagnosed (Of course I'm not saying this is wrong or anything like that, just something hard to understand).

This makes me worry about telling her because I don't want her to think she has raised some kind of a messed up family. The one thing I know about my mum is that she's cares a lot about her family, and that it's important to her that she thinks she's doing the right thing for us.

[deleted],asktransgender,"A Warning: Bad FFS Surgeon Beware / Dr Bart Van de Ven, 2pass Clinic /","
I am here to warn anyone considering FFS in Europe and beyond of any bad surgeons, in particular this surgeon: Dr Bart Van de Ven in Antwerp, Belgium, and his 2pass clinic.

I think we have enough evidence here from multiple sources to come to the conclusion that he should be avoided at all costs.
There are a couple of girls on this Sub Reddit alone that have suffered at the hands of him. See evidence below:

Beware of Dr Bart. My Story by KDLana: https://www.realself.com/review/belgium-facial-feminization-surgery-dr-bart-van-de-ven-bone-work-good-soft

See also this: http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kellie-maloney-surgery-nearly-killed-4677898

Patient death under his care: http://rachelwomanofherdreams.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/death-from-ffs-facial-feminization.html

I'm sure that some women would say they have had good results with him, and I wouldn't dispute that, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, and the references above clearly demonstrate he should not be risked for any major surgery, especially when there are much more reputable surgeons out there that don't have these stories.

I urge anyone to stay away from him and consider another clinic.

Dr Bart Van de Ven and his 2pass clinic also has a couple of shill Reddit accounts that they use to create fake reviews and advertise himself in an aggressive manner, presumably because some of his patients are speaking out about him, and aren't very happy with the negative press his 2pass clinic is receiving.

https://2pass.eu/about-us/our-team/drbart/

I urge anyone else who has been treated by him to also post here and share their story. I would post his name to ensure search engines can find this.

As trans girls, and someone who is considering FFS, we have more than enough on our plate with life and transition general to be taken advantage of further, and anyone negligent as he is should be highlighted and made aware of.

Since then I've talked with my mother (I'm still unsure of how she feels currently, still need to ask, but she more or less said how much I don't like who I am) and she's helped me get a ""list"" of therapists from our health plan, GEHA.

My problem is, not only is there no websites for anybody on what was sent, but when trying to look them up it's just making it harder for me to find what they cover since it's more or less a shot in the dark at this point, and if I did find someone I'd have to worry if they're really out of my way to get to them. So is there a better way to look them up?

Also unrelated question, has anybody bought clothing (not socks, like actual articles of clothing) pre-transition? My birthday is coming up and was wondering if I could figure something out about that."

This is particularly relevant to straight trans men (who have complications chest-feeding due to top surgery or T), or other early transitioning trans women at least 5 years post-srs/orchie &amp; HRT.  Especially relevant for straight trans women acquiring children through surrogacy or infant adoption.  "

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,Has transitioning made you realize just how badly you want/NEED a partner? How do you deal with that feeling?,"Obviously this might not apply to asexual/aromantic trans people so sorry if this question's not as inclusive as it could be.

Right now I'm an emotional wreck and it's almost entirely because I am feeling so alone. I know i'm not *truly* alone, since I have plenty of wonderful friends who I see and talk to regularly, but i'm feeling alone nonetheless.

I've grown to realize I need a lot of physical contact and physical intimacy to feel calm, normal, and happy. I need long, deep hugs, I need to be held, I need to have my hair stroked, I need people to just let me melt into their arms or their shoulder and let everything else fall away. I have one friend (who's more like a sister to me than a friend, honestly) who does that for me when I'm having my worst moments, but it feels wrong to ask anyone for that kind of closeness, even someone who's as close as a sister.

Obviously I want a partner. A girlfriend, to be more specific. And while plenty of people love me as a friend, only one woman in my 21 years of living has confessed she's attracted to me, and for long and complicated reasons, it's impossible for us to be together. 

I'm shy, i'm submissive, I have very little self confidence, I'm insecure about how masculine and ugly I still look and sound, and I've never even been kissed before. I'm not remotely attracted to strangers so I have trouble using dating sites or ""hooking up"". I'm so inexperienced with love and romance and yet I need it so badly. 

What can I do except hope for a miracle? Is there any way for my intimacy needs to be fulfilled that doesn't involve getting a girlfriend?

I'm sorry if I'm being melodramatic. I'm just really emotional right now. "
spacedog56,asktransgender,Is it difficult for trans men to date cis guys?,"I'm tempted to go back into the closet because I'm just so, so scared I won't find anyone to love me. The only reason I'm dating someone now is because we were dating before I came out. I'm going off to college soon though so that's going to end. I'm worried that if I'm out/transition nobody will want to be with me, not in a sexual way but in a romantic way. I'm almost exclusively romantically attracted to cis men (not that I wouldn't date anyone else, it's just a heavy heavy preference) and I'm scared that I won't find any that are attracted back. Can anyone weigh in about romantic life as a transman/transmasculine person? "
Tippytoppy22,asktransgender,How do I explain to friends and family that I need to transition and it's not just a social thing?,"I'm FtM and keep getting the argument of 'Gender is a social construct, just stop acting feminine' thrown at me by friends and family. They're trying to prove to me that I don't need to transition, because 'Gender isn't real' and I just need to 'Go against the norm' and 'rebel against femininity' and I'll feel better. I keep getting told 'Gender is a social construct, why do you need to transition if it's a social construct?' and they've printed me out pages upon pages of arguments about how gender is purely a social construct and they don't want me to transition if I can be 'saved the trouble if there is an easier solution like just being a tom boy'. :/ Which I don't want. I'm not female, I'm male. I'm already a year and a half on hormones.

And honestly? I'm stuck on what to even say back to them! I've been reading through the other posts about gender and social constructs on here, but I'm still really confused on what's the best approach this? And it's generally baffled me. I need to transition, because I am male.. I need my outside to match the inside, which is why I'm transitioning. But when I tell them this, they hit back with 'Yeah but if it's all a social construct, why do you NEED to? Why not just become a tomboy?' 

What's the best approach here? I can't think of a comeback that's simple and explains it. I mean, if gender IS really just a 'social construct' then I can see where they're coming from with their questioning, I just can't answer it! :S

I think I played it off like really well saying it was for a girl in school, I tried making it sound like I was crushing on someone. After that she kind of just gave me shit because it was kinda expensive buying it online and she said its cheaper in the stores. We moved on with our day after.

Thing is almost 2 years maybe, she caught me wearing her clothes and she got kinda mad. We're an asian family and I never really expected her reaction to be good if she knew.

Tbh I'm so lost, does she know and is trying to show she supports me by showing she isnt troubled by the odd occurence?

SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Could someone spell out the costs of transition for me?,"I'm having yet another panic attack because I go off my parents insurance in 6 months and have yet to line up a job for after graduation. I'm a business major, 'emotional' reassurances don't do me at all for this. Cold hard numbers do though. So what am I looking at without insurance for:

1)Estrogen + Spiro (through GoodRx when necessary)

2) Doctor + bloodwork every 3/4 months (I've been hearing $200 per round of bloodwork, my PCP is handling this so I'm assuming 100ish per visit)

3) Laser (not covered anyways, I looked on Groupon and see its about $250ish for 7 sessions. I don't know what the norm is for someone with average amounts of dark facial hair)

4) Voice pathologist (I'm doing this for 4 months on my folks insurance. I'm hoping I should be good by then because of my andro 'natural voice' but again I want a number in case I need a session or two down the road).

5) Tracheal shave: I'm not leaving the U.S on this one. If it costs me $5,000, then I'll eat the cost. Its the only surgery I want and I doubt I'm getting GRS if it isn't covered by insurance. An estimate from folks who have had it done would still be great though.

Conflicted123456,asktransgender,Nipple Play,"So for the vast majority of yesterday my nipples were as hard as diamonds, wasn't too shocking as my house is quite cold.

It was also really good, felt kinda comparable to years of prostate play, but better (and I was never able to finish from prostate stimulation alone).


Now I know this is a thing that can happen, but it was my understanding that it only happens for some women, and the real thing that is weirding me out is that I had been on HRT less than TWO DAYS, I thought this is the kind of thing that takes months if at all.

throwaway7892517,asktransgender,How to know if you're trans?,"Hey everyone. I've been looking around this sub for a while and I'm sort of unsure what to think about myself. First off, I was born a guy and I've got it down, I think. I had friends in high school, I wasn't too social before but kind of got along with everyone, went to parties, played sports in breaks. Thing is, I've been thinking about how much better stuff would be if I was a girl. When I looked at my female classmates I'd feel some heavy jealousy, like I wanted to be like them. I hated being excluded from their friend groups and not fitting in with them, and the guys were okay, but it sort of felt off. 

I'm heading out to college after this summer and I'm thinking about all this stuff and trying to figure out what to do. Is it normal to feel like you'd rather be a girl even if you don't feel like you absolutely hate being a guy, but feel ""eh"" about it and hate the whole male culture thing? I've played along to fit in, made all the dumb jokes, acted pretty shitty at times too, pretended to stare at classmates and be horny just to fit in and avoid being called gay. I feel like I'm too far gone to be a girl anyways. Almost like it's hard to picture myself as a girl even if that's what I want, I don't want to be acting masculine but I guess it just comes out of habit now. 

I guess this is turning into more of a rant than a question, but the main thing I guess is that I have this feeling of wanting to be female I can't shake off and I'm not sure if it's strong enough to pursue transition, like lots of people say they had to transition or they'd have killed themselves and I'm not sure I feel that strongly about it. And once you start everyone knows you're trans and it sort of ruins all the effort I put into trying to fit in in the first place. What if I ruin my life by trying to become a girl? I don't think my family will support me in this.  And I don't know anything about how to be a girl. So...I don't even know what I want out of this post, just that this is driving me crazy and I don't know what to do."

What are the chances of having ""motile""/working sperm while/after being on spiro/e?

Is it worth it holding hrt off for an year while I work and save up and not send money anywhere and/or find a second, third job?

CailanJade,asktransgender,Married and considering coming out? A wife's advice on how not to blow up your marriage.,"Cross-posted to mypartneristrans

My husband (he is still going by he) came out to me as MtF 18 years ago, went back in the closet, and in December he came out to me as being ready for the first steps of whatever his transition is going to be. It was rough at first, both when he came out to me and his new announcement, but over the past months we've learned a lot about how to navigate our new relationship. In the midst of the whole thing we figured out I'm also trans; bi-gender M/F. Which takes nothing away from the issues of our marriage and my mostly cis type reaction to his news. I'm still wrapping my head around my gender issues - which play into some complications for our own relationship, but I won't include those here. Only the point of view and experiences I see over and over among SOs, many of which match my own experiences and feelings to a T.

I have been fortunate enough that my husband has the better habits as far as what we need to do to keep our marriage together, and is also incredibly supportive of my own gender issues.

I am a member of several groups for wives of MtF transgender individuals, and between our own experiences and the many, many women whose stories I have read, I have learned a lot about how to make a trans marriage work, and what blows them up. I hear the happy stories of those whose marriage is better today than before transition, and the stories of destroyed relationships, torn apart families, and the ugly breakups - destruction of whole families' lives.

One of the more shocking things I've learned is the high rate of suicide and suicide attempts among wives of transwomen. Yes, because of their partners' transitions! So when you insist that you have to do this for your mental health, remember, you're blowing up her life and she has mental health to maintain too. Don't assume you're the only one in severe and serious mental pain! For many wives, especially in long marriages, their entire life and identity is wrapped up in their marriage. If they have no clue there's a problem in their marriage before the big announcement it is quite literally the end of their world, especially if they're not mentally equipped to handle marriage to a transwoman.

If your wife happens to be bisexual and/or pansexual and is open minded about sex and relationships, you probably have it made. For some women it doesn't matter. You are you. If you're one of these lucky individuals, then you have a much better chance of making it work than the average.

If your wife is straight and traditional, even if she's open-minded, this may take a LOT of work from both of you to really keep a good marriage on track.

*Talk to your wife as early as possible. Putting off the inevitable isn't going to help anything. It only makes the blowup bigger than it may need to be because of her anger about lying or hiding things from her. Also be aware of the timing of when you come out to her. If she's going thorough pregnancy and her own hormone issues, bad idea. Or freshly given birth/breastfeeding. More hormones. Don't do it around a holiday (particularly Valentine's Day, her birthday or your anniversary!), or a special day for her. New, stressful job? Give her time to adjust to the job first. If her grandma is dying, just, no. Use common sense to avoid piling on existing stresses.

*Don't expect her to take it well. Expect a few days to a week or longer while the news settles in and the shock wears off. Don't assume her first week's reaction is her permanent reaction. I was on divorce websites within hours of my husband's transition announcement, convinced my marriage and my life were over. I cried a lot. And I had 18 years warning! I knew he was trans, I knew it never goes away. Yet it was still like he had set off dynamite in my life. She may cry, for days. She may scream and rail at the world. She may simply go into shutdown mode. And it may change from one reaction to another before she calms down and can think again. She WILL need time to get past the initial shock. 

*Get both of you into therapy immediately. If you can pre-schedule a couples session for the week after you come out, do it. Take her to your own gender therapist for her own personal counseling sessions and and couples counseling together. If your gender therapist doesn't take couples or the cis spouse, make absolutely certain the therapist she goes to is a therapist who is at least strongly familiar with gender issues and is in at least some contact with your gender therapist, so they can make sure you're on the same page, and do couples counseling with that person. Most couples therapists usually don't understand much about the trans world and challenges, and sometimes end up giving poor advice, working counter to what you both need in order to come together.

*Offer to take her with you to your medical appointments. Don't force her, but do encourage her. Not just to drive, but to ask her own questions, make suggestions, and hear it all for herself. To hold your hand. For you to hold her hand. If you plan to make your marriage work, include her in the process as much as possible. You are not going through this alone. You are going through this as a COUPLE.

*If you can safely (mentally) do it, slow your transition down so she can come to terms with each step. Don't stop it for her, but give her adjustment time. Ask she if she's ready for X. Talk her through it, both your emotional and mental need for it, and the actual medical stuff when applicable. As I said before, take her with you to talk to the doctor so she completely understands. Have your therapist explain if necessary. Are there any other options for your treatment that would take care of the problem? Consider them. I'm not saying she has veto power, but keep her in the loop for medical decisions. She's not only your partner in love, she's the one who will be physically caring for you while you recover from surgery and can't walk for several days. She's the one who will be dealing with a 13-year-old hormonal girl in a grown male body. It's not a walk in the park.

*Don't forget she's still a woman with a woman's needs. You may be feeling the need to be treated like a woman, but, SO DOES SHE. Don't ask her to take the role that was yours. She is not going to be comfortable with suddenly becoming the man in the relationship. Remember, she's probably a cis female. She's not going to transition to male behaviors just because you're transitioning to female!  She needs flowers sometimes, and to be the submissive in bed, or the dominant, whatever you were before. She's still a lady. You may have to rework YOUR position and role in the relationship in the household to fit the new you, but DO NOT TRY TO TAKE HERS. Otherwise I guarantee it's going to go badly.

*Talk to her! She's not psychic. Don't expect her to know what you're thinking. Don't expect her to know what causes you pain, emotional or physical. Don't expect her to know what you prefer in sex, or what you never want to do in bed again. Tell her. And be open to what she needs too. Maybe she will agree to do things outside of her comfort zone, and you can agree to some things outside of your comfort zone. Ask her point blank about these things. Don't beat around the bush or hint. Just plain ask what she's needing from you. And be ready to provide as much of it as you can. There will be times when you're strong and she's weak. And there will be times when she's strong and you're weak. 

*Don't mistake honesty for an attack on you. Not every feeling or thought will be supportive of you, or positive toward your transition. If she can't speak her mind honestly about how she is feeling without you turning on her in anger, then she's going to shut down and it's over. Will it trigger dysphoria for you? Maybe. Even likely. But listen to her. Her feelings and pain are just as real as yours. Your pain does not invalidate hers.

*If you have children, don't get so wrapped up in your transition that you forget you're also a parent. Being transgender isn't a free pass to get out of parenting and doing half the work of raising the kids. 

*Don't abandon her for a newly discovered trans social life. Bring your wife with you to dinners and gatherings. If she was a part of your whole life before, she should be a part of your whole life after. If you have kids, get a babysitter. Don't start going off on trips with another transwoman for bonding and friendship. Your wife should still be your best friend. Sure, it's okay to have trans friends with whom you can share your experiences and such, but if you didn't go off and do stuff with your friends before, doing it now will only send your wife the message that she isn't enough for you. She is inadequate. And it hurts.

*Go shopping with her! You may both find awesome outfits, cool new makeup colors and she may have some great tips on women's clothing you don't know about. Make it a bonding experience together.

*Take her to a trans conference or local/regional gatherings. They almost always have sessions for spouses, where spouses can meet with others who have been through what they're going through now. Being able to talk to someone directly, face to face, to cry on each others' shoulders, is worth more than all the internet groups in the world. Also, being exposed to other trans individuals who are farther in the transition process than you are will help her get an idea of what her future may be like.

Thank you for considering my advice. It may not be right for every situation, but please, keep this in mind.

NinjaUnicorn_17,asktransgender,Responses to the bathroom argument?,"I'm giving a persuasive speech soon about the bathroom debate and am having trouble countering a certain piece of the argument. I want to address the argument that you don't know for sure if someone is trans or if they are just abusing the privilege by saying that they are trans. What's a good way to logically address that concern? Might not be able to respond until I return from classes, but I'd appreciate any help :)"
graaahh,asktransgender,"Do you prefer for people to refer to you as a ""trans man"" or ""trans woman"" or just simply as a ""man"" or ""woman""?","I want to see some opinions on this from actual trans people. The reason I ask is that I have seen, in a lot of discussions about social justice-type things that are either directly or tangentially related to trans people, people saying things like:

* ""this isn't a WOMEN'S issue if it doesn't affect TRANS WOMEN"" // ""(something about men)"" ""well what about TRANS MEN""

* ""trans people should be made front and center of this movement""

and also things like

* ""well what does it matter if they're trans"" // ""trans women are just WOMEN"" or ""trans men are just MEN""


So I guess I'm looking for some perspective. As someone who isn't trans but is wholly supportive of trans people, I just treat/talk about trans women like any other woman (and the same for trans men). I see the two options as mostly mutually exclusive; since I don't make a habit of calling out the gender of cis women and men in the middle of discussions, why would I constantly refer to a trans person as trans if I also claim to just think of them as women and men? But I've never actually asked trans people as a community what's preferred. What's your opinion on this?"

For me it was a really positive experience to think about myself and post all the things about me I'm thankful for having as opposed to the normal criticisms. 

In any case I really appreciated that and as much as I understand why people hate seeing the same questions I kind of feel like this is one I'd like to see every once in a long while. I feel like it would give people a chance to stop and reflect on their beautiful selves. 

But what about everyone else? Does this type of question cause more pain then encouragement? 

Or if you just wanna tell everyone about the qualities you love about yourself I definitely wouldn't stop that either. :)"

I'm not sure what I'm doing to get this attention.  90% of the time, I go completely unnoticed in public.  But within the past month or so I've been getting really weird looks from strangers.  Like, when I was in the airport the other day, this guy began staring at me with this really confused looking intense glare like he was staring at an alien, tracking me as I walked past him.  A woman kept staring at me intensely, would break her stare when I looked in her direction, and then return to staring again after.

A little background: I've been on HRT for almost a year, had partial FFS back in November, and present male in public.  I don't plan on presenting female until I pass better.

I want to take a mort gage on my body by either finding a guy who wants to make me his dream woman ( he can choose what I should look like,... ). Basically I will be his wife in exchange for my surgeries. I'm also willing to find a pimp who pays for my surgeries and let's me work as a cis female to pay off what I owe him.

Does this sometimes happen? That guys who want a wife pay for a trans woman her surgeries to have her as his wife or that a pimp pays for a trans woman her surgeries and let her work as a cis female?

I'm just desperate and this is the only way to pay for the body of my dreams. I'm on HRT. 

I came up with this idea after I saw how good the trans girls in the porn movies looked. There is no way they could have paid for those surgeries by themself so obviously the porn company they work for should have paid for the surgeries and let them pay it back by doing porn.

I want to go this way as well. Either a pimp, a porn company or a guy who wants me as his wife who will pay for all my surgeries including FFS and SRS. 

Is this possible/realistic to finance your transition this way?

I'm on HRT. Not trolling.

Anyway, i'm pretty confused about my gender, and how i even feel about it. So i'm kinda young, 14 (well 15 in like 3 weeks), and ever since i was like 6 I've wondered what being a girl would be like. I didn't know that being transgender was a thing but i would occasionally think about being a girl and how it would be pretty cool. I always had kinda long hair, and its got progressively longer as I've got older (its currently a little above shoulder length) and im kinda feminine as of right now (Pretty much no hair anywhere apart from my head, i like the fact im pretty slim, but i dont know if that counts for anything, and my personality isnt very masculine). 

After speaking to a transgender person online i started thinking about weather i'm transgender myself, and the more i thought about living my life as a girl/woman the more the idea sounded appealing. I dont know, maybe its just a phase, but it would be cool if someone could help, even to tell me im being an idiot or something, idk.

I've been grappling with this for quite some time. I believe that everyone should be treated equal regarless of any personal qualities, but even time I think of people who identify as transgender I hit a wall: what exactly is it that transgender people mean when they say they don't identify as their birth gender?

For example, if you have a trans-female (is this correct? a person who was born male but identifies as female?), how is that different from a femminine man? Is it something different from a man wanting to simply act/dress up as a woman?

Essentially, if men/women were culturally equivalent (same roles, fashion etc.) would people still need to identify as ""transgender""?"

Not an easy question at all.


And it gets better (worse?). This will be a three part question. The second set is asking you what the best solution would be to eliminate or minimize the possibility of prison babies being made and punishment for misbehaviour. So I want to know:


*  Do you all think it's appropriate to send this terrible human being back to the male wing as a punishment for misbehaviour in prison? 


* And what would you propose as a solution  in the context of concern for preventing prison pregnancy?


* And what would be a more appropriate punishment for violating the prisons rules regarding sexual contact?

August1453,asktransgender,"For those of us who spent many years solidly cis-het but are now questioning, have we been misunderstanding DESIRE all this time??","(OK, so first of all, Blanchard, autogynephilia, it's bullshit, we all know it, yadda yadda.  That's not what I'm talking about in this post.)


It's not uncommon to hear questioning trans folks say, ""I don't know whether I want to *have sex* with her, or *be* her.""  I know I'm certainly in this category.


One of the big struggles I'm having is that I don't fit neatly into **any category at all**.  I'm not a ""classic"" case of childhood-onset trans behavior, not Blanchard's autogyne bullcrap, and the non-binary umbrella labels just don't feel right (and they're certainly vague and unhelpful).


Complicating all this is that as a male, I'm *strongly* heterosexual.  I really, REALLY like women.  But I'm also really drawn to the idea of *being* a woman.


But given the fact that Blanchard's typology doesn't accurately describe me at all (eg, no erotic pleasure from womanhood fantasies, no erotic pleasure from crossdressing etc), where does that leave me?  Confused.



So that set me to thinking:


*What if for some of us, sexual desire itself is not experienced the same as it is by fully cis people?*  What if we have always misunderstood it?  What if mixed up within that strong, lifelong libido is an undertow of transgender envy?  What if the desire we feel towards sexy men or women is in part fragranced with the longing to *become* them?


What if this is the case, but we just don't realize it for decades?


I'm starting to wonder all this about myself for a lot of reasons (MUCH too long a story to go into), but it just seems like I'm beginning to understand that even if I had an infinite harem of the most beautiful women in the world (forgive me for the gross, exploitative image--I'm trying to illustrate a point), something would still be unrequited. 



I just don't find many other people out there who articulate these same kinds of feelings or questions.  And in fact, I can scarcely put them into words, myself.

FUNKYIMPACT,asktransgender,I took the biggest step-- I came out and asked my mom to call me by my preferred name.,"It went alright, to say more or less. The event occurred more than a few months or so ago and she accepts me I guess??? I'm far too exhausted to go into further detail. Didn't have any backlash or questions or anything.

The thing is, I gave her a recent call just to say hello and give her an update on everything. She dead named me ( most likely from habit ) and whatnot.

After the call, I texted her ""Hey, can you start calling me Kingston, please? It would mean the entire world to me.""

She basically gave me a long explanation saying (and this is paraphrased) that ""No matter what, you'll always be [dead name] and I knew the moment I laid my eyes on you that you were [ dead name ] and it has a biblical meaning and means grace and fate"" and blah blah blah and

I sorta expected this. I'm not hurt, but I am??

Well, I know the name is important to her. I do have plans on making my dead name part of my middle name when I eventually get around to my name change because of it's significance to my mother. I told her that as well and she seemed to be pleased by it, but I still have yet to see/hear her call me by my preferred name.

numlock1,asktransgender,What age should i start HRT?,"Im 16(and a half), and blah blah blah stuff youve heard before
Thing is, i dont want to come out yet, and if my parents pay for the surgery, i will end up owing them back( i want to get out of the house asap, history exists if you are desperate why), and putting a huge dent on our economic health, low as it is. 

Also, my friends, im not sure how they will handle it. Sure, they aren't my friends if they cant, but i can't be so one sided. None of us have had serious talks, and we are more like playmates than actually friends, and they would probably be very confused if i came out. Everyone, while our school is very kind, and understanding, will find it hard to adjust, and be staring at me in that pitying and fearful-of-offending-you-by-breating-in-front-of-you way, and act the same around me as well.

My parents, will probably think i've gone full hypochondriac, considering the amount of time it took to get the message across that i was attention deficit, and now, im trans? Im not sure what will happen.

But im not sure of the consequences, as it will be about 10 more years until i can afford it independently. Is it worth it, will i basically be unable to transition later on, will i be able to survive, etc?

MurakamiDelRey,asktransgender,I 'm still 'one of the boys' and I don't k or how I feel about it.,"Very little makes me doubt being trans except for my friendships. For some reason I feel more accepted when I'm with a group of guys then when I'm with a group of girls. As soon as I'm 'with the boys' I really enjoy it and feel like I'm one of the guys but as soon as I remember that I'm trans I feel like shit because I'm not being true to who I am. 

Obviously I know that boys can be friends with girls ect but idk, it feels wrong and right and the same time. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience, is this at all normal? "
ithinkthatimagirl,asktransgender,How do I alleviate dysphoria whilst still very much in the closet and absolutely petrified of being outed?,"So, I want to preface this post with an apology, because I'm really not sure as to whether or not I'm going to make any sense. 

I have realised over the course of a few months or so that I think I might be transgender. I was born male, though I have never fully understand why I just never felt that comfortable with 'being one of the guys' or doing anything that most guys would typically find fun. I can remember being dressed up as a girl, and enjoying it as a child and always feeling this perverse sense of shame when I looked at girls clothes as something that I could ever own or wear myself. I've been experimenting with clothing (though very sparingly as I'm honestly quite poor and rely solely on the money given to me by my parents for income, aside from a part time job). I desperately want to buy underwear, and bralette's or anything that can make me feel the slightest bit 'girly' whilst I still live life as a male. The real question is, how do I start to experiment more and understand/accept myself? I know for a fact if I were to come out, I would need to live a different life, totally separate from the one I have now.. in my own head I have internalised being trans as essentially meaning that my current life needs to die in order for my new one to start. 

I really just want some tips on what I can do (on a low budget) that will make me feel girly, or that will alleviate my dysphoria whilst alone in my room. I just want this constant battling that's been going on in my head to stop, because I've spent plenty of nights sat awake feeling like an alien and I just want to know if there are some things I can do until I decide what I want to do big picture, that will alleviate the way I'm feeling and hopefully make me feel a little bit more like the girl I feel I am inside.

I'm sorry if this is ramble filled and a bit confusing, I'm just really struggling and want to know I'm not alone. 

tl;dr - I think I'm trans and just want a way to alleviate the feelings whilst on a low budget, remaining in the closet. "
StuckInABadDream,asktransgender,So my mom passed...,"I posted here recently:
https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5tdh11/my_gender_dysphoria_apparently_caused_a_lot_of_my/

And I mentioned the problems I'm facing with transitioning, everything, and now my mom passed away. It's so hard to take in actually. Despite the fact that a part of me feels relieved she was finally free from all the suffering (fuck cancer, and ""alternative"" medicine) but yet I'm only 18 and I didn't manage to come out to her before she left...

I just feel so destroyed now. Like I can't grieve because I'm so numb and desensitized to all this. Life just constantly fucks me up the ass and I can't fight back without hurting myself. It's like this uphill climb where the slope gets ever so steep. How do I stop myself from giving up...because I really feel that life isn't worth living anymore. It isn't worth it expending all this energy to fix something that's already FUBAR. I'm just taking in all this pain, with no guarantee that I'll ever make it in the future. It's like chasing a light only to be hit by the train when you enter the tunnel."

mtfstuck17,asktransgender,"I'm stuck between three options, I want your advice","I'm 17, MTF from the UK, and I have two options I could do in order to transition. I am not entirely sure what to do at this point, and want you guys to help me.



For those who are not in the UK, sixth form (aka college) is education when you leave school at 16. I'm not sure what the equivalent of a-levels are though.


**Option 1 ** -  Continue sixth form and do my a-levels until July 2018. This will mean I will probably have to wait until I am 18.5 until I could start hormones. I will have to go the NHS route, which will take over 18 months from referral to appointment (so I'm looking at August/September 2018). I'm not entirely sure if I will be alive this time next year if I choose this though.


**Option 2** - Leave sixth form. I will have no a-levels, however this does mean I will be able to get a job, and pay for freezing sperm and HRT before I turn 18. There are no part time jobs literally anywhere were I live (I live in a small town, the nearest big town is 10 minute drive). However, there are full time jobs. I am technically breaking the law by doing leaving education at 17 and not 18, but this isn't really enforced (I know one or two people who are not in education). Nothing is really done about it. 


**Option 3** - Like option 1, go on HRT but don't freeze sperm and never have kids. Although this does involve DIYing it however. I'll have to wait until I finish sixth form until I could get them legitimately.  


Being able to have kids in the future is quite important to me. For me it goes Option 2 - Option 3 - Option 1 for best to worst.

To me, I think option 2 is probably the best one. I might not have any a-levels, but I will be able to get HRT and freeze sperm probably by the end of August. I don't know if I will be able to live with option 1, the thought of not being able to transition for another 1.5 years worries me a bit. 
 

It's getting the point where it feels like suicide is the easiest option. Do I want to continue living as male, and not be female? Or do I want to transition to female, but have to go through the whole transitioning process, probably lose all my friends and family, etc?

Is starting at 32 more early-ish or more late-ish? Is my glass half full or empty?

I see on this subreddit most of the people here seem to be 20s..and I simultaneously relate to them and not at all...most of the people on r/translater seem to be 40s plus...I relate to them and also not at all.

Does any other people in their 30's keep flipping a switch that tells them ""I just made it in time and thankfully will eventually pass"" and ""GOD I started so late, I'll never pass"" I feel like this age group might have uniqe trappings, but I don't know.

But I'm not sure if there will be any negative effects if I don't take them 12 hours apart?
SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,"This is frustrating, I thought they understood...","So I know a lot of my posts have been getting ignored lately, probably cause they've really been MTF-centric but I dunno how to be inclusive on those particular topics. So if you keep tabs on what I've said in the past my insurance is most likely going to cover SRS for me which is a god send considering how literally crippling my dysphoria is.

I'm a 25 year old pre-op trans woman, I'm unemployed and I do small gigs for money to get the stuff I need however.. I live with my semi-supportive parents. Well I told them the good news of the surgery being covered and info on the surgeon I'll be seeing.

Anyways, I don't have a date yet.. I'm going to consult with this surgeon on the 24th and I've been really eager for it. However my father has been very, very cruel on the subject... 

My parents plan to go on vacation in August and before I even knew surgery was an option I agreed to take care of the animals, we have a 70 lb dog and two adult cats. Now I know that for the first month of GRS I'm going to have to avoid strenuous activity which is totally understandable.

As of right now, I have to see a psychiatrist to get a letter and prove I'm ready for surgery, my doctor has already prepared to write one out for me but I need the second letter and I have a history of gatekeeper psychiatrists despite being full-time for 6 years. This means that I can't actually get a surgery date until I get the second letter which scares me cause I know this surgery has a long waiting list typically.

So why am I freaking out?

My genital dysphoria has been gradually getting worse, my crotch always lets off a radiating feeling letting me know it's there and my brain and body both know it's wrong anymore. This leads to me going into panic attacks, major depression and losing basic motoring and functionality. I can manage to do ""ok"" if I can distract myself such as typing long walls of text like this. Who knows how long that'll last though, my coping methods seem to last 30-60 days before no longer working.

I was threatened I'd be kicked out if I'm unable to take care of the animals, take the dog for a walk and what not. It doesn't matter that I'm possibly getting an operation that can change my life for the better. This shocks me because my parents despite doing nothing for me previously and pressuring me into insurance to begin with are the ones putting this impending doom over my head.

My father is literally telling me this surgery is not a big deal and to ""get over it."" Which is downright upsetting considering I thought he understood.

My legal name is still male, my gender marker is still male.. so being homeless is a very scary idea. I also don't live in a blue state, but rather a purple state and the area I reside in leans toward red.

Has anyone else had such a terrifying situation come from someone they thought supported them? You were scheduled for bottom surgery and now you're being pressured to cancel it all because it gets in the way of some plans despite how life changing it'd be?

Sorry for this wall of text, it's just.. I'm kind of freaking out despite nothing being certain yet. I'm used to having my hopes and dreams shattered related to transition, but losing this opportunity would probably be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Especially with how increasingly unbearable my dysphoria is getting.

TL;DR - 25 yr old mtf with crippling genital dysphoria being threatened of eviction by formerly supposedly accepting parents because surgery may get in the way of parents vacation. Documentation is not changed. Has anyone else had such a similar thing happen to them from someone they thought was supportive?"
Bi-Vis_Jacket,asktransgender,Words to use in an email to request a self referral?,"So I attended a trans support group a few night ago and there I asked about informed consent because the hospital that does the group also does informed consent for HRT. The problem is that they need a referral from a doctor before they will provide it. I talked to the Trans youth program coordinator and he said that I could sent him an email and see if I could be self referred. 

So I was wondering if there are special words I should be using that would make it easier. Similar to mentioning hostile work environment to HR in a workplace dispute kinda thing."
amon_erin,asktransgender,Relationship Question,"I've been quiet lately on here for the most part. Partially because I've started to normalize and things are starting to look like the crap I went through for a few months at the start of HRT was worth it. Anyway...

So I'm tired of being lonely. My friends (at least all of my friends that I have where I live) seem to be moving forward in their life, but I'm stuck. I mean, I'm working on me (via transition and other things), but I feel like as time rolls on and I go longer and longer with never having a relationship that it's just never going to happen. Especially  since I'm dealing with the whole being trans thing that I'd been trying to run from for a couple of years (okay, longer than that, but definitely a couple of years).

But I feel like right now it's unfair to try and start a relationship with anyone. I'm not full time, and I won't be for a while. And I feel like there's literally nobody I can date unless gender is irrelevant in the equation to the other person (I'm pansexual, and gender is basically irrelevant to me). I'll meet someone I like and the first thought that comes to me is something like ""They'll want nothing to do with a relationship with me because I'm trans and they think I'm a guy"" or something along that line of thinking. 

I never really spent much time before dealing with my trans feelings caring about relationships. I'd try to date in spurts, but I never put much effort into it. It's been like 2.5 years since I last went on a date with someone.

I know I can't be the first person to feel this way. Or the first person to be in the same situation. I guess what I'm wondering is, is this ever going to change? Because I can't see this as being sustainable.

And it sucks because I met someone a week ago who I know isn't straight and I was immediately attracted to, but she doesn't know I'm trans and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH."

Now, I don't really get that so much, but I don't feel like I *pass* either.  But yesterday it was unseasonably warm, so I went for a walk and sat on a bench in a park near a pathway, people walked by &amp; kids played in the park &amp; no one seemed to react to me negatively / aggressively, so I guess whether or not I passed, no one cared &amp; so it doesn't really make much difference to me.

PrincessLobster,asktransgender,"The best way I've found to explain using new names/pronouns to people who don't ""get it"" - maybe helpful for some?","I know a lot of people have trouble getting the people in their life to use new names or pronouns, so I've thought about lot about this issue to try and find the best way to handle it. Here's what's worked for me, and I figured it could be helpful for those struggling.

Basically, you have to make the person realize that by not listening to your requests and deliberately continuing to deadname/misgender you, they are in fact purposely disrespecting and hurting you simply because they can. No, it doesn't matter that that's what they've always called you, and it doesn't matter that they birthed you/took care of you (just to address a couple common excuses that people use for refusing to use new names and pronouns). None of that justifies hurting someone you love by deliberately going against their wishes, and when framed in this way, I feel like many people will come around even if they may not agree with transitioning. So, an example conversation could go something like: 

""I completely understand how hard this is for you and that things are going to be weird for a while, and I don't expect you to be perfect overnight. However, what I need you to understand is that by refusing to address me in the way that I've asked you to, you're knowingly going against my wishes and doing something that hurts me. And, that is not okay because everyone deserves the same basic respect of being referred to and treated as they want to be. So, if you could please just be patient with me and realize how much it hurts me when you use the wrong name/pronouns, I'll be patient with you because I know that mistakes will happen and this is going to take time for both of us to get used to.""

Either, say, MTF and essentially passing with the exception of facial hair, or ftm and still trying to hide facial hair that might have started growing early in transition?

It seems the rumors were true, and the issue of whether or not trans people will be able to use the bathroom of their choice is now in states' hands.

QueenKragg,asktransgender,Male Failing (?) and Sexism at the Same Time!,"So, I'll first start by saying this is the first time I have ever male failed (I think it was male failing at least lol), and still not entirely sure how. I've only started transitioning recently, and haven't gotten on any sort of HRT or anything (though hopefully within the year!!). My hair is about shoulder length and I'm not terrible with it, and my features are on the feminine side, but very much (at least in my opinion) still mostly ""male.""

But so I was talking to a friend, who apparently showed their coworker a group picture that happened to include me (while in boy mode), and their coworker went ""She needs to wear more makeup, she could look a lot pretteir"" and pointed to me.

I heard about it, and he showed me the picture, and I guess yeah I'm wearing more androgynous clothing and my hair does look kinda cute in it, but at least to me I look 100% a guy. But then right afterwards apparently I didn't look ""feminine"" enough for him so he had to comment on my lack of makeup. I dunno, I just can't stop laughing at both what happened and the coworker's reaction, that apparently I look like a girl, but not enough like a girl to some people haha. I just felt I would share and hopefully you all would find it as funny as I did.

And a question because I guess we are actually ASKtransgender, is it considered male failing if it wasn't in person? I'm just curious because I feel like it shouldn't because being able to pass in person feels a lot harder, but at the same time might because I was, at the time, very much not trying to look like a girl."
sappho_of_lesbos,asktransgender,Is anyone here a US .gov employee with experiences or policies to share w/my .gov HR?,"Hey folks,

I'm a transgender woman who's been going through medical and social transition now for about a year and a half or so. I'm at the point where I'm scheduled next week to talk to HR at my small US Govt. agency. We are in DC, so people are pretty well-informed I think in general, but I do not think they have a policy here for employees going through transition. My body has changed enough that people who pay attention might know, but generally most of my co-workers are probably ignorant.

I suppose my question is, does anyone have any advice to share? I've seen the OPM guidelines and will share them with HR. I was kind of hoping someone knew of a policy at another agency that was well implemented which I could refer my HR folks to, for guidance.

My former employer in the private sector had a *great* policy, but I do not think I can share it since it was non-public. I might ask them though, for clarification.

I'm kind of afraid that HR will be looking at *me* for advice. I don't really have any. I have good relationships with my co-workers but am really hoping training and/or a group meeting with HR could put bathroom questions to rest, etc. I really don't want to have those discussions myself and am hoping to not have to bear the brunt of the transition process at work *by* myself. Y'know?

I try to eat 800-1k calories on light days, 1.5-1.7k on more heavy days (like special occasions, it happens sporadically) 

But eating this amount of calories is already making me very hungry and I've to ignore the hunger and go to bed trying to sleep like that. It sucks.

I don't know how I'm going to get rid of this belly fat when it's not really healthy to eat below 1k calories per day. Any advices?"

astropop312,asktransgender,My best friend just began hormone therapy,"I am a bisexual woman, my best friend is beginning their transition from MtF and I couldn't be more supportive. I've seen him (preferred pronoun for the time being) struggle so much with gender dismorphia his entire life and had no idea how to help him. He has obtained so much love and support from his newly married partner, and with such a supporting group of friends he decided to begin taking hormones. In roughly three months, he will be forced to explain himself to his family (which will be difficult because they are very republican, reserved, hard catholic in their beliefs) and we do not expect it to go well at all. We live in the deep south, so it was hard enough for him to find the correct care for mental health and physical health. It was almost a trial to find anyone accepting of his choice to transition. He was a regular drinker (truthfully bordering alcoholism) and smoker before being approved for therapy, and has stopped cold turkey ever since he was approved. I am not worried about his will bending, because this transition clearly means more to him than any sort of substance abuse, but I am worried about the effects of withdrawal on top of beginning hormones.

I've suggested small things to him, like keeping a small journal or record. Documenting small changes in his habits, mentality, emotional and physical state. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has some insight, suggestions, ideas that could possibly help? Anything from suggestions for decent shops/stores online for people mid-transition, makeup tutorials, stress relief, coping, etc. I want to offer as much love and support as I can during these trialing times. Anything helps!"
throwcrying,asktransgender,"Loneliness, depression, can't do it anymore","Today was my first day off from work in a while, I had a few errands to run but instead I've just cried all day. I'm 21 MtF and work in a hyper masculine, outdoors environment in the heat, and my dad is the boss. I'm out to my parents who are accepting, but nobody else. I wear jeans to cover my shaved legs at work, and constantly get asked why. I wouldn't be able to be out at this job (even just out as bi), I'd put up with too much shit even with my dad as the boss. It'd be too awkward, I wouldn't want to work there. I've got the same group of friends since highschool and while I like them, they're fairly homophobic/transphobic and I know I'd lose most of them, which tears me up. I can't keep living a lie, but I don't pass (1.5 months on HRT). I want to run away, but wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm so lonely it's killing me.

I'm working a job I don't like, with coworkers and friends who would think I was a freak if they knew who I really was. Some days I can't even function I'm just a mental wreck, and my parents want me to go to university anyway. I want to leave all of this. I want to be somewhere else, doing something else, with someone else, as someone else, and I can't do anything. I just feel so horribly unhappy, I'm crying as I type this and feel like I have nobody to talk to.

How does a 21 year old with no skills or qualifications and about $1300 in the bank, leave everything behind and start afresh? How do they ignore all the friends and family who try to contact them? How do they create a new life and identity from nothing? Or if I can't do this, how can I explain to my parents what I'm going through? I can't work, I can't study, I can't do anything. I feel like I need to just stop everything for a while, and that everything is meaningless if I can't even be myself in day to day life.

Mellowbelle,asktransgender,My facial hair dysphoria has gotten so severe that I'm thinking of blistering my skin to get rid of it all. Do you think this is too extreme?,"Last year I discovered something about the way my hair and skin works. I had my hair cut by a barber who is a bit on the old side. I didn't mind because I don't care how my hair is cut. Well, he screwed up by going a bit too far with my hairline, which caused me anxiety, but he also nicked me in a couple of places. I looked online to see if the hair in those areas would grow back. It's been months and they haven't.

Next, I accidentally touched part of my arm to a hot pan that came out of the oven. It caused a blister, but I didn't worry too much about it. It took awhile but it finally flattened and caused a little discoloration. But I noticed that the hair in that spot also didn't grow back. So what I've discovered is that by getting blisters and scabs, I can effectively get rid of my hair.

So, what I've dubbed as ""Operation Blister"" is a plan to heat up a metal object, and press it against my face. This will cause blistering, which will get rid of my facial hair. It'll hurt like heck, and may cause discoloration, but the end result is worth it. I will only enact Operation Blister if I feel like my laser hair removal is not yielding potent results.

**tl;dr** - Blistering gets rid of my hair. I'm going to burn myself to get rid of facial hair. What is your opinion of this?"
username15554,asktransgender,I'm a bit confused,"Hello everyone, here is my story, I need some help figuring out what it all means.

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love very much and it feels natural to be the male partner of the couple. Yet I'd also love to be a female. Not a mix of the two thing but rather be able to switch between one and the other whenever I feel like it. I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example.

Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male. I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels. Whenever I did that, I, for some reason I don't know, got an erection.

Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.
Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.

I'd love to be able to do this: I wake up in the morning and decide I'm going to be a man today. So I do. But in that case it would be 100% man, nothing in between. Another day I might decide to be a woman. So I get up, I do my makeup, wear a dress and high heels and have my day that way.

What does this mean and what be a solution for me? Is this just attraction to the female side like any heterosexual male is or what is it? I don't feel sexually attracted by other men, I'd just like to be able to be a girl or a boy, whatever I feel like.
Thanks"
ts_curious,asktransgender,"Did anyone else (MTF or FTM) feel that you had to grieve the gender role that the world (and maybe you) saw you in, when you realized you were transgender?","So, maybe a weird question, but just wondering if anyone else, either MTF or FTM that felt that when you finally realized that you were transgender that you had to kind of grieve the man or woman that you worked so hard to portray for both the world and maybe also yourself? Does that make sense?

I am accepting that I am MTF, after years of repressing my true gender because of fear, and though I would love to transition, its still not time for that yet, because I am now just trying to sort things out with my wife. Anyway, after I came out to my wife, she took it rough, but has since kind of calmed a bit. She is ok with me being on the transgender spectrum, and even if I identify as a woman, but is not so comfortable with the thought of me transitioning. She has said that she has been going through a grieving period where she kind of had to grieve the traditional marriage that she thought we had, with the traditional role that she though of me in. 

I understand her, and I kind of feel that I have to grieve the male gender role that I have invested time and energy to build so to speak. I kind of envisioned what kind of dad (no kids yet) I would be (I think I would be a fun dad like Phil on Mordern Family). Now, accepting that I am a woman inside, I feel like I kind of have to approach these ""dreams"" from a different angle, depending on what happens with with my wife and all. Even if I would choose not to transition, I still feel that the role that I imagined myself in has changed.

Did any of this make any sense? Anyone else feeling similar? How have the journey been?"

My family isn't transphobic or anything like that. So, sometimes when I look in the mirror or just generally sometimes I kind of just ""feel"" like a girl, it's kind of hard to describe. My only friend (who's MtF) says that when she was a kid she kind of felt like that and it got more intense as time went on. I feel no pressure from my school because there are probably only ten transphobic students in my school and the school takes hate speech pretty seriously. Some people probably think I'm trans because I kind of look feminine and I have really long hair and a few people have asked if I'm trans before. I also feel like I'm stuck in a loop between ""I should take this seriously, if I ignore it, it could be a problem"" and ""If I'm not, I'll make a fool of myself."" Also, when I think about it, I either get a weird feeling in my stomach or just get uncomfortable. Also, my only friend is trans and (this might be a stretch, I know nothing about psychology) maybe my subconscious is trying to relate to all this? So, I ask, am I trans?

ColourMeConfused,asktransgender,NSFW Am I trans?,"I would've thought it's a simple enough question, but after years of reflection I'm still not much closer to answer.

It's hard to know where to start, so I'll just go chronologically for the most part. My history:


As far back as I can remember, I have been fascinated by women. The female form, women's clothes, makeup, 'feminine' behavior... mainly as an observer at first. At some point during elementary school I saw a fake nail on the ground and hid at home in my room behind a bookshelf, soon to be joined by a lost earring. Eventually my mom found them and chastised me while I, red-faced, could not come up with an explanation for why I had collected them. 


Soon after, out grocery shopping with my mom at giant, I furtively pocketed a bottle of nail polish and this time hid it under a tree out in the yard. My parents worked late, so when I got home from school and was unsupervised (starting in 5th grade) I would sometimes go into the yard and paint my nails. What an exhilarating feeling! I would rub the nail polish off before it dried, using some isopropyl alcohol if necessary, since I certainly couldn't let my parents notice my habit. I had masturbated by that age already, but this experience with the polish wasn't so much arousing as exciting in a more basic sense, an urge that needed to be satisfied. 


Not long after this started, I began playing WoW and masturbating more regularly with the content being... consistently weird. Sometimes I imagined men, sometimes I imagined women, but the consistent feature in these fantasies would be that I was restrained and the person would somehow use magic to transform me (initially against my will) into a woman as we had sex.


I began wearing my moms clothes some days when I was home alone, sometimes accompanied by a (badly) applied layer of lipstick. After a couple years passed and I discovered porn, the fantasies translated here too. I would imagine myself as the woman getting fucked by the man. Here lies one of my points of confusion though, I was aroused by the female's figure, her appearance, her make-up, her voice. The particular form of the man (beyond not being hideous) didn't seem to matter, he was basically just an object-- a random dick to put it simply. I was aroused by the thought of having sex with a man, but not any specific man and I was never aroused by a man's specific physical features. In real life, I had developed numerous crushes on girls my age. I thought some were cute and I wanted to be around them (though my best friends have always been guys) while I have never felt the same way about any guy.


Now it's important to note that my dad has always been highly homophobic (and transphobic) though my mom is LGBT friendly. That being said, I have never felt bound by my dad's views and have disagreed with him on many things for as long as I can remember. I never had much respect for authority. So with this in mind, I have repeatedly throughout my life contemplated the possibility of being gay or transgender given the unusual nature of my sexuality and some of my behavior. I wouldn't have minded (as much as I can tell) if I thought ""Do hot guys turn me on?"" and the answer was affirmative, but it was simply never the case. Whether I am trans was a more complicated question, it's not so easy to tell compared to just examining the kind of people you find sexually attractive.


As time passed, things progressed. In high school I bought more nail polish, along with mascara eyeliner and eye shadow. God I was (and am) soooo bad at applying makeup. I also bought some women's clothes for the first time. I'd often apply the whole ensemble and jack off (often to trans porn or lesbian porn) with a vague sense of shame overtaking me moments after finishing whereupon I'd take everything off as quickly as possible and hide it again. When college came and I moved to a flat in London with a couple roommates the freedom was even greater. During the winter when I could hide it I had shaved my whole body a couple times, I would paint my toes and keep them like that for weeks while just wearing socks when around other people, I bought a wig. I developed anxiety and depression that comes and goes, but how or if it fits into this is difficult to tell. Sometimes I'd spend a whole day dressed up and locked in my room not interacting with anyone in person. It's not so much that any of my friends would have minded if I were trans, but that since I was certainly not sure I didn't want them to poke fun for what would have seemed best described as a cross-dressing fetish. Or autogynephilia.


That brings us to the present day. I am 22. I have been agonizing over this question for years now and I am still terrified of the idea of upending my life with a transition, even if I am not scared about the prospect of being trans in and of itself. Obviously there is a bunch of evidence to support the idea, but at the same time: I am not repulsed by my body or dick, I am not disgusted by the idea of being a man... and yet, there is always this lingering feeling that I would be more comfortable living life as a woman, that I would give anything to live in a woman's body even if only for a single day. I am stubbornly independent and dismissive of restrictive ideologies, differing in many ways from my parents and often ignoring their wishes altogether... but yet the moment I cum, the desire temporarily vanishes and a weak sense of shame overtakes me. I am aroused by the thought of getting fucked by a guy... and yet, I am physically attracted to women and I have never developed a sexual or romantic attraction to an actual man. I have had girlfriends, I have had sex, and even just making out with them was/is enough to arouse me greatly. That being said, it was more difficult for me to get off while masturbating or having sex than if I were to imagine myself as a woman. Maybe that's just because I have been used to it for so long, I don't know.


So my question is: Am I trans? Does my sexual arousal in heterosexual situations as well as my arousal at the idea of being a woman conflict with the idea of being trans? The thing that scares me most about transitioning is the relative permanence of the situation. What if I am wrong? Of course, I can always do a trial run of sorts but that will have to wait until I am done with school and living on my own. Hopefully someone here can help me resolve this confusion at least to some extent and provide some guidance going forward.

elyn6791,asktransgender,I've been living in my head for 27 years.,"I'm trans MtF in South Florida.... And alone.

I've been on hormones for over a year now and the changes have been slow. I used to be androgenous in my teens and I slowly see myself becoming so again. This makes me hopeful of the future. The older I got the more I seemed to turn into an old man and it's made life more and more intolerable. I honestly feel like I'm not only becoming more androgenous again, but younger too. Also, if I can return to androgyny, can I go further? Right now I feel like I'm just undoing the damage but not making progress.

I've come out to my brother but he isn't supportive and treats me no better than he would a stranger. He helps me with groceries and bills when I get behind. I wish I could say that was enough but I feel more like an obligation to him. I don't think he would miss me if I were dead. We grew up in a very problematic household and so say it was dysfunctional would be an understatement. I rationalize the way he treats me a long term sign of that. While I feel I have learned to put that in the past, he seems content to just work, eat, and sleep until he dies with as little meaningful fulfillment as possible while I am determined to evolve and go down this path...Even by myself.

He isn't supportive. Even though he caught me crossdressed once when we were in our teens, he claims he never knew. There were numerous times I messed up and he clearly knew something was off. This incident is just undeniable to me.

The only person I could call a friend I tried to talk to the other night and while just trying to see how he felt about the election and what the Trump administration means to people lives, he made it very clear he only cares about how he treats people in his immediate ""bubble"". He is religious and while I've known him for 20 years off and on (he lives out of state and we talk still from time to time), we rarely ever meet up.

The reason this friend is so important to me is he is the only person left in my life that I could use that term with any real honesty. If I lost him in my life, even though we rarely ever speak,  I would be devastated and truly alone. At the same time he has always been someone I've held in the highest respect. To me, if anyone would be supportive of me it would be him, yet a year and a half ago, I was desperate. I called him asking for help and told him I would be making a life altering decision soon and was suicidal as well. This decision would change the course of my life over the next 2+ years and I needed his support desperately. I clearly asked for too much as I did not hear from again for 6 months when he texted me ""Hey, did you get that help  you needed?"" Still I hold him in my mind as a member of society that I can have faith in. In a way, especially after this election, instead of him being the lesson that voted in the interest of other people as well as himself, he didn't vote at all. I've lost faith in my country. He made me feel secure in humanity though because there were good people out there and I knew one. Now I don't know at all. I feel lost without the knowledge.

Like many voters he didn't vote because he allowed himself to be manipulated into thinking neither candidate was good and failing to see how Trump, Pence, and crew would adversely affect civil rights. Although I never came out to him, I thought he cared about people in general. He believed at least some of the propaganda about Clinton, and couldn't see that even if she was just a dishonest politician, she wouldn't be a destructive President.

Even though our friendship has never been 100% honest, I would rather keep pretending than lose it altogether. There is no one else left for me to rely on. I feel I will become lost and suicidal again if I lose my last and best friend in my life.

Up until now, and since I was 14, I decided I had to be independent. I've forced that to be a defining factor in my life until recently. I'm 41 now and have known for many years I was fooling myself. My definition of Independence was not just financial independence but social as well. Fearing how people would treat me, I created a life of self imposed loneliness. I allowed myself some friends over the years but a hint of not being cis and straight meant people just stopped being a part of my life.... With usually no warning.

Why did I write this even? I'm just very lonely. I need to meet people. I've forgotten how. If I had friends that I didn't have to hide myself from, it would simply be easier to come out to the ones that didn't. I think I really just needed to get these thoughts or if my head. At least if someone reads them, I will have communicated with someone.... And that's a start.

BowDrawer,asktransgender,Having a bit of a crisis right now,I know that I'm a trans-girl but I keep getting thoughts in my head about really being a guy or making my own feelings up. I feel so much happier and like myself as a girl. Just thinking about myself as a girl and finally being myself makes me so much happier. But I live in a house where I've been told that trans people are confused and sick and that the devil makes us this way. Those kind of bullshit thoughts keep popping into my head and now I'm completely doubting myself even though I'm not religious. Help!
UnknownSpecimen97,asktransgender,To the people that are questioning their gender,"I see many people come here questioning their gender and how they would rather live as the opposite, but doesn't ""mind"" living as their current one.

Ask yourself this: Do you really not mind living in your current gender? Or do you tell yourself that to try and make it easier? Forcing yourself to be happy?

If you are having these thoughts, I think it gives off a very strong vibe that you're trans.

I'm just saying, to those people, I know transitioning is very intimidating. You may lose family and friends, it's usually very expensive and you will go through a hell of a ride. But it's worth it, really.

If I hadn't accepted myself and come out. I know these thoughts would've gotten worse and worse and they did. Eventually you just gotta say: ""Fuck it"" and do it. Cisgender people do not feel this way, but we do. Don't be afraid to be yourself.

It's better to be hated for who you are, than to be loved for someone you're not.

apoorboysthrowaway,asktransgender,No signs of being transgender as a child?,"For context, I'm an FTM, asexual and currently 16; I've been out to my parents for about 6 months now. In that time, I've made almost no progress in getting them to acknowledge my gender, although my mom did reluctantly buy me a binder (and I don't think she would have if I hadn't already bought one on my own beforehand without her knowledge). I've tried to have a heart to heart with them before but it always quickly devolves into my dad repeating TERF-ish talking points about it being okay to just be a ""masculine woman"" (I'm actually fairly androgynous in so far as my hobbies and tastes) and that I can't ""change who I am."" My mom is more patronizing and sort of plays the ""good cop,"" saying that she believes trans people deserve rights but that I'm just not one of them. Among her reasons include the fact that I never showed any signs until puberty and that I didn't think about the possibility of being transgender until last year, even though that's when I first learned about trans people due to the whole HB2 ordeal and my civics class. 

While she has said other crazy things about my gender, like how she thinks the fact that I'm asexual means that me being trans is about wanting to ""not be a sexual being"" or that I'm trans because I'm overweight and ""have a poor self-image"" I still feel like maybe I can't be since I didn't know as a child, I'm not out to anyone else except my best friend, and I was actually really girly as a kid. Like, when I played a video game and didn't have the option to play a female character, I got really distressed. The same thing also happened when I didn't have the option to choose something pink, although that might have been anxiety related or something. I just wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience of not knowing as a kid or if gender related anxiety and trying to fit in, even when you don't really know that you're trans, is anything common in other people's experiences. Like, how do I know that I'm not just crazy or projecting onto my past experiences, and how would I go about proving that to my parents?"

TransGalacticOzone,asktransgender,Dysphoria and brain fog.,"Someone on Reddit a few days ago used the analogy that being the wrong gender mentally is a lot like trying to run emulation software on the wrong hardware. It will never run as smoothly, even on more powerful devices. Great recent example from my own life, while I am running a Gamecube emulator on my 2014 MacBook Pro. My MacBook Pro is a much more powerful machine than a 2005 GameCube, however as it is emulation software, it is not designed to run natively on the hardware, and so, in big open spaces and when there are lots of moving items, I get slowdowns.

After applying that analogy to my own life, I can so much identify with it. With my brain, it feels like there is always a fantasy reality running parrallel to my regular sensory input life. They then have to be translated to what? This body? Don't I have this narrative that I have a female body damaged by T? Maybe it's the perception of this body that I have to live up to? It's so weird that the hardware is the perception from the culture I'm in, not the actual physical body? Or maybe is it the hormones that I have to live up to? A big blended mix of both?

All this emulation running means that I am not operating fluidly. It means that I have a constant percentage of brain power deducted from the available pool. I'm sluggish, I don't pay attention, I forget common words when trying to string together a coherent sentence (keyword, trying). This makes it extremely difficult to A) Hold a conversation B) Remember information that can be used to start further conversations and C) Show that I care and am actively listening (and if you think about it, I'm not actively listening). And when you are closeted, and all your thoughts are taken up by something you can't talk about, you don't talk. And when you do talk vaguely about things being wrong, it's annoying to other people. You're a downer without any easy path to resolution, and don't have an easy path to resolution because you are holding back crucial information about what's wrong.

Eventual solution: I have to collapse that fantasy and transition my reality to one that more closely resemble that fantasy. It is the reason why I can't focus on growing as a human being, why I'm stuck at entry level jobs. Every aspect of my life, everything, bends and falls back into the black hole that is my dysphoria. Nothing can escape it.

* I can't focus on growing at work, and I know I could, I was given the opportunities, but I don't have the focus to make it happen. So I fall back down to level 1.
* I've done a good job with school, as an adult, in that I get good grades, but I treat it as an afterthought. I work for the grade, when I want to work for the knowledge to grow as a person, and apply what I learn towards hobbies I don't have because I either focus on dysphoria or waste time running from reality with useless Facebook scrolling.
* I can't focus on growing friendships. For one, not only I can't remember personal details about them, things that friends should remember about each other, since I'm so focused on myself and my own fantasy world, but two, I have to overcome INTENSE anxiety to even talk to anyone, anxiety that is draining me and sending me into constant recovery mode.

Anyone identify with that?"

FUgenderroles,asktransgender,"If there were no gender roles at all, would you be like this?","I think this so often, and it's bugging me a lot.

Imagine a world that there where people who were AMAB or AFAB, however you could present as masculine/feminine as you wanted no matter what you where assigned as. You can wear dresses or a suit, no one would think any different of you.  You can wear as much or little makeup as you want, have your hair in anyway, etc.


Do you think you'd be as dypshoric as you are now (if at all)? I don't think I would be that bad. I feel like if I could just wear female clothes and be like present like any one who is female, I just wouldn't really feel like this. The fact I can't because I am AMAB is what annoys me.

Mom

I know you love me very much and I hope you will understand when I say you what I am to tell you. I am transgender. I feel more like a girl than a boy. I know you probably have questions like 'How do you know' or maybe, hopefully even 'Why didn't you say so sooner.' The answer to the first lies in something called gender dysphoria, which is a dissatisfaction with one's assigned gender. I feel this all the time, in fact have been feeling this for almost 5 years now. I do feel lucky to have someone who I hope will understand as a mother. I am still the same person, only I'll be happier. I would like to attend therapy to determine what to do.

I don't have an obvious larynx in the first place and can only really see it a little if I push my head backwards. I also have a pretty high natural voice to the point where I was ma'amed on the phone before I started HRT presumably because my voice is fairly androgynous.

I'm definitely not complaining, but I'm just unsure how to practise then. My pitch is pretty much predominantly female and my voice actually hurts when I talk at a lower octave to hide it for prolonged periods of times.

What I have trouble with grasping is resonance. I'm probably just a dummy but I don't get the concept of it at all.

Also, how do you know if your voice passes? Is it better to let others judge?

rlsharkboy,asktransgender,I have a couple of questions about changing your gender marker.,"So, technically, I'm a Tennessee resident (unfortunate, I know), and I went back in December to the court to get my name change done.  They filed the paperwork, but didn't have any court dates before I'd be transferring down to my new university in Florida, so I have to fly back up over spring break to get my name changed on March 14th.

This is where my questions begin.

I'm never going back to Tennessee again.  I didn't even want to for spring break.  My parents are having a house built here by the end of May so I'm not going back after March.  A huge problem with Tennessee is they won't allow you to change your gender marker on your license unless you've had SRS.  Florida, on the other hand, will allow you to change that if you're ""undergoing proper treatment for gender reassignment"" and my doctor on campus is more than willing to write me that letter.  

How soon can I get my Florida license if I've only been living here since January?  And does January even count since I'm living on campus or will actual residency not start being counted until I move into the house with my parents?  Since I have intent to become a resident and my parents have a house being built, can I go get a new license with my new name and gender marker as soon as I get back from spring break if I bring the legal documents?  Or do I have to get a new one from Tennessee even though I'm no longer living there, and have a license with the wrong gender marker on it until I officially become a Florida resident?"

katiecuon,asktransgender,Tell me your moving out stories! I need comfort.,"Hello /r/asktransgender !

I'm 18, 6 months on hrt and nobody irl knows I'm trans. I present as male. My parents know I ""think"" I'm trans and have said and done some pretty awful stuff about it, along with threatening to kick me out several times for simply saying I'm trans.

My father says if he finds out I'm taking hormones, I'm getting kicked out. He's made jokes about my privates and said I'll never be a girl. He's thrown away my beauty supplies and hid my passports from me (which i eventually found). He's asked me to log into Tricare and show him my prescriptions, but I never did. I can't call my girlfriend while my parents are home without getting in trouble.

I tried to move out and my girlfriend and I pulled enough money together to do so, but I ended up getting an a wreck (totaling my $10k car) while driving in the snow in January.

My father is in the US military and we moved from Italy to Kansas about half a year ago. I don't really ""know"" anyone here and I hate introducing myself under my deadname as to not get punished by my father. All my friends are online &amp; they're the only ones that refer to me by my name and pronouns.

I still want to move out. I talked about buying a car but my parents say I don't need one because everything's on base. I walked off base to a 7/11 to get a taxi so I could check out a cheap car but I got scared and backed out of it.

I'm really afraid of moving out by myself and not being able to ""swim"". Struggling to pay bills. I make less than $10k/year and finding a new job will be difficult without a college education. I only have $3.5k and a $3.7k loan for a new car. I wish I could room with someone but I honestly don't know anyone around here. I'm afraid of moving out, not being able to go to college, and being stuck in a bad financial situation.

I'm extremely sick and worried. Please tell me it's possible. How did you move out? Am I just overthinking things?"
understandinggender,asktransgender,Is this genital dysphoria? (MTF),"Hi, everyone,

I am currently living as a gay male, but am circa 75% sure that I will/should transition into a woman. 

As a gay male, I have always been exclusively a bottom. I don't recall a time wanting to top, either; I don't like the idea of using my penis that way. I'm ok with *having* a penis, but I would prefer to have a vulva and vagina, I think. That said, the possible discomfort, cost, commitment to dilating, and loss of sexual feeling as part of SRS would discourage me from having SRS, I think. 

Are these experiences pieces of genital dysphoria? Are these feelings common of gay bottoms? Are these feelings common of trans women? I've clearly identified other forms of dysphoria that I experience, but I've seen myself as not having genital dysphoria, and now I'm not so sure that's true....

• ""You are a fucking horrible bastard. Just thought I would let you know. You smarmy prick. ""

She has signed a contract promising she would never do this again (see http://imgur.com/a/1bTjt). The website was taken offline.

Apparently she was really serious about ""I will make sure I cripple your business If its the last thing I do”.

Again she is trying to destroy my reputation by inviting everybody that has complains about me to inform her. She created several accounts under different names on Reddit that all agreed on me being the most terrible surgeon on the planet, and to watch out for me. Most of those posts she deleted afterwards to destroy the evidence. Just surf to all posts mentioning Dr Bart van de Ven on Reddit: you will see a lot of “deleted” paragraphs, these were from one of her accounts on Reddit. After enough initial damage done, she removes them. Jen is one of her Reddit account. She has removed the post https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5rwxmd/a_warning_bad_ffs_surgeon_beware_dr_bart_van_de/ immediately after I posted the explanation as written in this post below her post. I recognised her on one of the pictures she published on her Jen-account.

The life of a doctor has become very vulnerable as a few people can hijack your complete reputation on anonymous fora. As a doctor, I have performed over 1,200 facial feminisation surgeries and the number is still growing. Our medical facilities are state-of-the-art and the vast majority of my patients is extremely happy with the results. I would say at least 95 percent is very happy. However, regardless of the surgeon or procedure, there is always a chance of complications or that the results are not what you expected. If complications should arise, we need you to keep your trust in me so we can solve the problem together. Although it's only a small percentage, probably around 5 percent, of surgeries where mainly minor complications like an infection occur, it could happen to you. This is the law of statistics. If you operate more, you have a higher absolute number of complications. So yes I have complications too. Luckily, most of the time we can solve the complications completely. It is normal to be scared if a complication occurs, and it's understandable if complications make you feel worried or even angry. But we have to solve the issue together. And rest assured, normally we can.
It's important to remember that it's not only you who depends on me as a surgeon, but I also depend on your co-operation for a positive outcome if complications would occur.

Dr Bart van de Ven, maxillofacial surgeon, 2Pass Clinic, Antwerp, Belgium.

honda19792g2,asktransgender,Going on HRT for the experience (not trans),"Over the last 2 years I have been on reddit looking at some incredible transformations of mtf/ftm which has been getting me a little curious of the actual effects of HRT, To be very clear I am not trans and love being male but really want to experience the process of cross gender hormone therapy, up to this point I have seen a therapist have my letter (of course I had to lie) and have an appointment with a endocrinologist to go on HRT, I am a little nervous but excited at the same time and I am going to record my experience.

DanielleInTheMaking,asktransgender,Feeling all former doubts disappear since starting HRT. Anyone have a similar experience?,"TW: suicide, body dysphoria 

I've been wanting to transition on a conscious level for the past year now, but was having doubts that it would help or if I was even trans at all. But now that I've been on HRT for a little more than 2 months, I've never been more certain.

In the past 2 weeks, it feels like, I've gone from being suicidally depressed to feeling like I can finally live again, which is ironic considering my body dysphoria has massively spiked since starting hormones. I've also gone from feeling content with my genitals to being nearly unable to touch them or think about them.

Has anyone had this level of denial too only to have it disappear once they consciously started their transition?"

megalinax,asktransgender,Is my child too young?,"My child is 4 years old and born a boy. At 3 years old he was saying that he was a girl. His favorite color is pink and loves Minnie Mouse, which he dressed up as on Halloween. When he first told us, we didn't make a big deal and it was kept between my husband and I, just because we weren't really sure how to handle it quite yet. 

About when they turned 4 (he's a twin), we were called into a meeting with the director of the preschool, she was concerned because he was sucking his thumb a lot more and not really playing with his twin brother as much. She then told us that my son told her that he was a girl, I don't know how or why it was brought up, and that we needed to tell him that he was born a boy. She even suggested having my husband find pink shirts to wear so that my son sees it's ok to wear pink and still be a boy. She also said that when he wears his boy clothes he's so much happier than when he wears his girl shirts. I was pretty upset after the meeting because I just felt like I was being told to not let him wear girl clothes. There was so much more that was said but I'll cut it short. 

Now I'm not sure what to do, I have family members that say he's too young to fully understand his gender identity, and that we should wait until he's older. That we're setting him up to be made fun of at school because of what he wears and I shouldn't let him choose his clothes anymore. I just want him to be happy and I wish I knew what to do, so I'm asking for advice or personal experiences if you all don't mind sharing.

SlippingStar,asktransgender,"People going through estrogen HRT, have you noticed your hands/feet being colder?","There's a long-standing hypothesis that estrogens cause the body to keep heat more in its core than its extremities, have you noticed this as you've changed your hormone balance?

EverlastAtom,asktransgender,The First Step - My Coming out Letter,"Hi!

I plan to come out to my mother this Friday - she's off work for a few days after that, so she has a while to 'mentally recover' if things don't go according to plan. I'm going to sit with her, hand her the letter, and hope she reads all the way through to the end (I make a point of that a few times in the letter itself). 

I don't really know how supportive she'll be. I feel like she's always thought I was gay - I have no evidence, and I try to tell her that I like girls, but it always feels like it's forced when she mentions me being in a relationship with one. It feels like she's trying to gauge whether or not I'm lying? But this isn't that (it's hilariously far from that), and I'm genuinely lost. She worked as a Nurse for the last 8 years and has recently switched jobs, which in turn has made her a way better person - happier, livelier, everything. She's sort of my role model, even if she's not the type of woman I'd like to be myself.

Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you wrote a letter to come out as trans, and if you did, what part specifically brought your point across? 

If anyone is interested, this is my letter (sorry for the swearing! Is it against the rules of this sub?) Would anybody have any suggestions/improvements?

(It reads like I'm a pretentious twat, sorry about that. It's how my Mum knows me.)

&gt; ""Funnily enough, I never imagined I’d be guaranteed a spot in Uni and working a job before telling you this. No, it’s not that I’m gay – trust me, despite what you probably thought at one point, I’m interested in females. That’s ‘kinda’ what this letter is about, sort of?
(And no, it’s probably not anything you’re thinking of right now – unless it is, in which case, please keep reading anyway. Just read it even if you’re 100% sure what I’m going to say.)
&gt;
&gt; Hey Mum.
&gt;
&gt;I’m probably fidgeting nervously with a pillow right now, or staring blankly into nothing. That scared kid that you see there? It’s the exact same one that you raised. It always will be. But it’s got something to say, and it’s not sure how to say it. I’ve never been good at talking about my feelings, and you know that. Please appreciate how hard this is for me – I’m appreciating how hard it might be for you to accept it.
&gt;
&gt;I love you. I wouldn’t be telling you this if I didn’t. What exactly is ‘this’, then? It’s something that I’m in the process of correcting already, so regardless of what your reaction is and how (un)supportive you are, it’s happening. Pardon my French: I’ve isolated this part of myself for a long fucking time now, and every time I’ve tried to hint towards it, or even mustered up the courage to show you one of the letters I’ve written in the past, I spiral down the path of self-doubt again and the cycle just repeats. It’s fucking agonising. I’m done. I’ve tried to make excuses, rationalise it as something else, treat it as a ‘phase’ that I’m going to grow out of; I’m tired of this shit. Pardon my French again. Nothing has worked and nothing will work. And I don’t want anything to work. It’s who I am, I’m tired of running and hiding. The only way I will get better is by facing it, and this journey starts with telling you.
&gt;
&gt;Okay.
&gt;
&gt;Say there’s an 18-year-old musician. He’s good at singing and playing guitar. His parents saw him pick up a guitar when he was 3 and made him believe he was destined to play one, so he never questioned it, but once he grew up and saw his first ever magic trick on TV, he knew that deep down he felt like he wanted to be a magician. He didn’t want to disappoint his parents though, as he’d practised guitar for so long, and he was scared they might try to talk him out of changing professions because ‘music is all he’s ever known’, or ‘music is what’s best for him’. So he started practicing magic behind his parent’s backs, and after learning about other magicians and their success stories with magic tricks, he knew it wasn’t just passion or a passing interest – he knew that he was born to be a magician, and that with or without the support of his parents, he was going to become one. His parents were never going to ‘change his mind’, because it’s who he was.
&gt;
&gt;Remember, keep reading until the end of the letter.
&gt;
&gt;Okay, that 18-year-old? That’s me, but instead of being a musician and knowing I was meant to be a magician, it’s being male and knowing I was meant to be female. I’m transgender. I’m going to transition from male to female. (HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) is what the process is called. I’d be surprised if you didn’t know what this was. Basically, it’s medication that increases oestrogen count in the body and can also suppress testosterone).  I know that’s a lot to take in, so please, try and calm down and keep on reading.
&gt;
&gt;Gender Dysphoria - Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. It's sometimes known as gender identity disorder (GID), gender incongruence or transgenderism.
&gt;
&gt;It’s who I am. It’s huge – massive – but I can’t change it. I’ve tried, I’ve desperately tried to be a different person, but in all honesty, I’ve been doing that for my entire life. ‘Being a different person’. And you know what’s ironic? I’ve never felt like a person. I’m a sheep, or a follower, or whatever you want to call it. I’ll adapt to people around me to suit their needs, and it’s gotten me by, but I just can’t anymore. I need my own personality – to be my own person. To do that, I need to physically be the person that I am mentally.
&gt;
&gt;If you don’t understand any of this, I’m going to try my best to help you and make it easier. I’m not going to ask you to keep this to yourself, but for the love of God, don’t say a word about this on Facebook, or to Dad, or to [brother], or to anybody that you don’t trust with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY won’t blab to other people (that means [sister], I think everybody in bloody [county] would know if she knew). But just for now, try to keep it on the down low until you fully understand the implications and the scale of me being transgender.
&gt;
&gt;So, what happens next? I’ve contacted a therapist who’s going to help me initiate the process. They’ll discuss with me my thoughts on this, and help me discover the person that I really am. After a successful diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria has been made, I’ll go onto contacting a Dr that specialises in gender identity, and then acquire blood tests (one way or another) to monitor my liver/kidney function and other relevant statistics. If all is well, they’ll put me on a prescription of hormones that will begin to reshape my body (I know, it’s not going to end up &gt;being perfect – I missed the opportunity for that 6 years ago, when puberty started. Oh well.)
&gt;
&gt;My plan is to do this all privately, without the help of the NHS. If I were to seek aid from the NHS, I’d have to be put on a waiting list that could see me doing nothing about this for 2 years. I can’t wait that long. I need to start now, well before University – I’m an idiot for not coming out (again, not in a gay way) sooner. Also, I want to make this clear, this isn’t a plea for financial aid. It’s my decision. I can set aside enough to pay for this.
&gt;
&gt;So, that’s it. What’s what I wanted to tell you. I’m transgender. I know that this will be hard for the both of us, and I don’t know what the journey is going to be like, but I know that it starts with this letter, and finishes when I’m finally living as the daughter I was meant to be. Don’t think of it as losing a Son – you never had one in me. That kid right there is your daughter who’s worn a paper bag over their head, and it’s going to end up suffocating them unless they take the paper bag off.
&gt;
&gt;Look up now. I’m probably crying or something, but I want to talk to you. You’ve trusted me so much in the past. You know how mature I am. You need to trust me, now more than ever.
&gt;
&gt;Signed,
&gt;
&gt;Your Middle Child.""

Transgenderquestioni,asktransgender,Did your feelings ever fade?,"I'm at a part in my life where I feel as though I may end up coming out about how I feel soon after being in the closet for almost a year and a half. But I'm scared because lately the feelings I had that year ago aren't quite clouding my mind like they used to. I recall back when these feelings first started flooding in, around when I learned a sex change was ACTUALLY possible, I thought about these issues I had and what it'd feel like to be female all the time, but recently work's been piling up and the thoughts have slowly started to drift away... and now I'm reaching a point where I worry that the absence of the feelings I had represents that I might've been wrong all along. I hate to think this way considering my thoughts about being trans were literally the thoughts I had, 90% of the time, every day of the week. It consumed me. Now it's a small niggly feeling in the back of my head. ""Maybe you should tell someone.""

I'm posting this because I want to ask if any successful transitioners ever experienced this kind of a dillemma. I say this because I do want to be transgender, in a sense, and so I would very much like to be either reassured that this loss of feeling is only temporary, or to be confirmed that it means i was wrong from the start.

Thank you all."
torchickftw,asktransgender,More ramblings no one cares about.,"As I sit here on the verge of HRT (two months away).. I feel myself loosing control even more, depression comes and goes, and I'm not sure how to control these mood swings, I sit down and just plan, look forward to my bright future. But at the same time all I can think about is how it'll get ruined. Will someone in my family discover my plot to transition? What if something goes wrong? What if my transportation breaks? What if I loose my income? I'm driving myself insane, but at the same time I'm hopeful. 

I feel like the woman inside of me wants to be alive, she wants to live, and I've rejected her for 22 long years, I've told her no, I've told her that she's wrong, everyone else has put her down. Now more then ever does she want to live, she wants to experience things she's never got to experience.. going clothes shopping? Teasing the boys? Being infatuated with someone? Being able to be bubbly and not have any care in the world. Define happiness they say? Well to me she is my happiness, she is my dream girl, sweet, smart, ditzy, but yet driven, and I am her. 

I'm not sure what to expect in the coming months, but anything is better then being trapped in ones mind, being ashamed of feeling this way, and regretting everything ever done in life. Anything has to be better then this deep pain I've experienced for so long.. by god if I have a choice, she will live, she will be amazing, and she will be wise to the world. Okay that's my ramblings for the day.. I had a hard time getting through my work night, and I wanna use this as a little self journal. Thanks for anyone that cares! :)"
magnesium1984,asktransgender,I went too extreme with my transition and regret telling people.,"I have been transitioning for almost 3 years and I am starting to have second thoughts, I never really thought of myself as a girl but was not totally comfortable in my male roll either, plus I like to look more feminine or pretty and think Hypermasculinity is not attractive in terms of  the physical and mental ways of being,that being said as of late I have been starting to question myself and feel what I am doing is not a good fit, on many occasions I feel ridiculous for looking the way I do,and doing things with my appearance that don't suit me, I guess I feel like a clown at times and think what the hell am I doing to myself, but now most people I know think I am transgender and know what I have been doing with myself  and think I want to be a woman so it would be very uncomfortable to go back on my words and say I made a mistake, form that point on no one will take me seriously,but at the same time I am happy I have experienced what I have but at a great cost of family friends and health, I know trying to get things back to normal will be hard but will make me happier in the long run, I guess you can consider me non binary but I went way too extreme I could of been happy without medically transitioning.(I know this might offend some people I  apologize if I do).

mid-brow_undertones,asktransgender,Can I really make friends when I'm trans?,"Sooooo I'm bad at going out of my way to make friends anyway due to some rather extreme social anxiety (college made it so much easier).  But now, in addition to not being in college, I feel like I legitimately will have to deal with discrimination.  I had both guy and girl friends and appreciated both immensely and would like to make both.  It was easy for me to be likable to anyone when I was an effeminate guy, but now?

Honestly, I'm scared of making guy friends.  I'm scared of just starting up a conversation with a guy and coming off like I want some sort of romantic relationship.  I'm worried they'll look down on me.  I'm worried I might be in some sort of danger.  I'm worried of making girl friends too because they'll think I'm fake.  And I'm worried that people, in general, will exhibit veiled discriminatory behavior.  You know like, accepting transgender individuals in your rhetoric but unconsciously thinking they are weird and not wanting to hang out with them (I'm guilty of doing this, though not to the lgbt crowd).  And yeah I know there are LGBT centers to meet people at, but how do I know these people even share my interests?  I just don't want to be hated or alone or cloistered in my own little bubble of transness.

whatami23,asktransgender,Need some advice on my gender,"Throwaway account because I'm not really ready to announce to the world that I'm gender-confused.

If this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of thing, or if there's a better subreddit it for me, please tell me. I really want help on this.

So, I've thought I was a girl for a very long time. I've changed my gender a few times since then, generally within a range of ""female but BARELY female"" to ""completely nonbinary"". Recently though, I've been leaning more towards being nonbinary.

Strange as it sounds, I've only recently started considering myself as transgender. A part of me wants to cling to being a girl, but there's been plenty of signs in my life saying I'm not. My name used to be very feminine and whenever I wrote it down (since I was a kid, even) I got this uncomfortable feeling in my gut. When I got it changed to a much more gender-neutral name, I felt incredibly relieved. Sometimes when people use ""she"" to refer to me, I get that same feeling I did with my old name. 

It may be part of being asexual, but I've never been comfortable with my chest being obvious (I wear a lot of baggy clothes and even considered getting a binder at one point). And I honestly don't know if it counts, but when I got a pixie cut, I thought I was cute for the first time in a while and just in general felt...comfortable with it.

I've had a lot of people that seem to assume I'm male, both online and irl. (Though irl it's usually in the form of mostly masculine nicknames, like ""buddy""...I've only had one person irl outright call me male. But it's much more obvious online that people think I'm a boy, sometimes even if I put it my profile that I'm female.)

And then, of course, there's just the general feeling that I'm not a girl, if that makes sense?

I guess I have a few questions.

First, am I actually transgender? I feel sort of silly asking, since I'm pretty sure I'm neither a girl nor a boy, but...in a weird way I'm a little afraid to accept the label.

How do I figure out what pronouns I want? As I mentioned earlier, ""she"" sometimes makes me uncomfortable, but so does ""they"", and I don't know about ""he"" either. as I've mentioned earlier, I've had people assume I'm a guy and refer to me as ""he"" (online) and I've been mostly okay with that. Sometimes I think I'm more comfortable with ""he"" than other pronouns...but is it okay to be called a he if I'm nonbinary? I'm afraid people will think I'm a boy, which I guess this post makes it sound like I am, but I REALLY don't think I am.

I've had quite a few people in my life tell me that I don't really need a label, but I WANT a label. It would be nice to have an answer other than ""I don't know"" when people ask what gender I am. Is there a reliable place where I can figure that kind of thing out? I know it's pretty much up to me to decide what I am, but I'd just like some help with it.

I'm lucky enough to actually have people that support me, but this whole thing is still giving me a lot of anxiety. I'm nervous about possibly being trans, about what people (strangers) will think if they find that out, about just in general not really knowing my gender...

Any help on this is appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

dolphinsarepink,asktransgender,Should I update my Twitter profile to the real me or create a new account without anyone knowing my history?,"I am a 19 year old MTF about to start taking hormones and present as a girl 24/7.

Now that I'll finally be allowed to give my birth defect the middle finger and live as the real me, I'm wondering if I should come out to my 100 followers on Twitter, update my profile pic, etc. 

But there just seems something great in starting over on the internet. By turning over a new leaf without anyone's previous images of the person I tried to live as. The only thing is that various friends and political commentators follow me, and my history will probably be dug up at some point in my life anyway. 

I have a YouTube channel with 6000 subscribers and have already decided to abandon it. I don't want to come out to them as the demographic that has watched me is likely to be extremely rejecting and abusive.

Also, when I watch my YouTube videos from the past six years, I feel extremely uncomfortable, like I'm watching the person I tried so hard to be. 

Now that I've found the real me, I don't want to ever live another day pretending to be what I'm not or be told I'm 'mentally ill' for not conforming to a lie for the sake of God's fuck up.

felineprotector,asktransgender,"Turns out injections(E) really didn't work for me, what now?","Hello transpeople of reddit.

Started HRT 4.5 months ago. 3 months on 4mg estrace, 100mg spiro.

At 3 month blood test my T was an 29ng/dl and E was at 51 pg/ml

Switched to injections and just got my results back

My estradiol was fucking 6 pg/ml, fucking six. This is halfway through the injection cycle too, so thats even fucking better. My T is now back to 300 ng/dl yaaaay

Fuck me sideways, right? 

So I'm going in today to discuss with my doctor.

I would rather subpar E with proper T than high T and abysmal E. So fuck injections, for me at least. I know tons of people love em, but I do not want to risk another 6 weeks at least of nothing. Should I push for a higher dose script of patches, or switch back to the pills? 

I feel that the patches might work properly, but I'm scared of trying another route of administration which will ultimately not fail while my T rages onward and I lose all my progress, especially being 18, and been having spared much of later stage puberty.

dayna_j,asktransgender,Looking for advice on progesterone dosing,"Hi all.  I've decided to add a progesterone cream to my HRT regimen.  [I have purchased Emerita Pro-Gest cream](http://www.womenlivingnaturally.com/product.php?id=113), which consists of 48 ""single-use"" packets; each containing 20mg of progesterone.  The website suggests applying twice daily for 21 days of the month.  However, these instructions are obviously for cis-women.  

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how transwomen should use the cream?  Specifically, how much and how often?  

I am hoping to use it to enhance my breast development, which after 1 year of HRT has been extremely underwhelming (Barely an A cup).  

Also, if anyone has had positive experiences with progesterone that they would be willing to share, I would be very interested in hearing about them.

Thanks!!"

TohruRokuno,asktransgender,What resources are there to help my trans friend move to America for college?,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to ask this.

I have a trans (MtF) friend who lives in Trinidad, and she desperately wants to get out of her abusive household and come to America to go to college. Her father insists on using her birth name and refuses to acknowledge that being trans is a real thing.

I've opened my home in Wisconsin to her so she could live with me while going to college (either Madison Area Technical College, Milwaukee Area Technical College, University of Wisconsin-Madison, or University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee), but her mom (mom supports her, dad completely does not) doesn't have the financial resources to pay for college. And since she's not a US resident, she doesn't qualify for FAFSA or US student loans at all. I can't cosign for any loans because I've made bad financial decisions in my life and my credit score is awful.

She does have a valid tourist visa to America which allows her to stay for 6 months at a time, but she can't get the student visa to go to college without an I-20 form from the college, and they won't issue an I-20 without financial proof that the international student can cover a year's tuition, books, supplies, transportation costs, and mandatory insurance (about $22k-$34k/yr.).

What resources are out there to help? Her father has said that if she doesn't have a job or college sorted by her 18th birthday at the end of June her choices are either to move out or she can stay in that house but her father is going to force her to become a policeman (not policewoman). She's said that if either of those happen she'd rather end it all and I can't bear for that to happen. Please help."

PoisonousRoses,asktransgender,"Went to therapy to work on transition. Instead, learned of childhood trauma. Now dysphoria seems to have vanished?","So, I have been on &amp; off HRT for a decent amount of time. Around a year and a bit over a half. I never had any therapy or counselling previously, which in hindsight is the worse decision one can ever make, in my opinion. 


Anyway, I mostly enjoyed the effects of estrogen, and the things such as laser hair removal. I began to get more and more depressed though, at the lack of faith in potential passing capability in the future, as well as a continual lack of love for myself. I felt worthless or undesireable, and I found that concept reinforced by society constantly. 


So, I went to therapy to get some much needed help to alleviate depression, and to work on voice training / other life issues. I had become suicidal recently, where I was unable to function normally and began to consider ordering something to get it done. I have the money and know the means to order it, and even had the tab open at times, ready to press the purchase button. Gladly, I did not.



Today was my third visit with my therapist. Last night I had been getting a bit paranoid of sounds around the house, and generally felt afraid. I continually check my room for intruders, even when I know that logically it would have been impossible for someone to break in. This is nothing new, it has been continual from my childhood. For the first time, last night I decided to try to question why I did that, and began searching around. 


While I never had any direct memories of abuse, I did remember having sexual contact with other children when I was young. I remembered at least 4 separate incidents with 4 separate children, that all happened between the ages of 4 - 7. This was a revelation to me, as I had remembered all of these incidents, but never took the time to think about my feelings regarding them, the real meaning that those acts had, or to wonder how/why I knew to do those things at that age. I don't really think it is a huge deal right now, earlier today I was really stressed about them and felt very awful. Now, I am still concerned and want to learn more, but I don't know if I would call any of these cases Sexual Abuse, because I don't know if any of it was non-consensual or damaging. I'm just trying to understand where the adults were, why I started some of these acts, and for the others that I do not remember fully: Who did start them and why? 


I feel like this is a deep sadness or wound that I have never really registered before, and I also remember being sad or lashing out with anger all throughout my childhood, which I believe may stem from this as well as other issues that I hadn't really fully understood previously, either. What's interesting is that as the day has gone on and I have begun to go through this issues, I have felt my gender dysphoria almost entirely disappear, if not entirely. I feel more ""okay"" or even *good* about being male than I have for at least a year, probably a lot more than that. I kind of feel that if I feel like this everyday from now on, I would just prefer to drop the hormones and re-integrate myself as male, although I will still be feminine (hey, that's just me!). I don't know why my strong desire for a female body seems to have been tied to this in a way, but I wonder if maybe some of my childhood abuse led to a distorted self image... maybe even involving gender/sex due to some stuff, and that may explain some of my dysphoria? I know this sounds like the BS that republicians spam to transgender people ""huur duurr you are just an abused gay boy, not a real woman!"", but I guess all I can say is that reality is sometimes so strange that it becomes a cliche. I am a bit worried that my feelings will change or that my dysphoria will come roaring back soon, but I guess that as long as I am honest to myself it should be alright.

thebossneedshelpta,asktransgender,Just hired a transgender women and wondering if there's anything I need to know?,"So I'm sorry if there's anything offensive in this post. It's 100% not intended, this isn't a community of people that I've dealt with in the past and I'm just looking for some guidance :). 

So I'm a project manager at a mid size engineering firm in Canada. I run a team of 7 engineers, 7 of them are men, not by design but honestly there isn't enough women in STEM and I hire based on proformance not sex organs. Also they are all in their  mid to late 20s, I'm in my mid 30s. So this year I got approval to increase my team to 8 for a few new projects coming down the pipeline. I like having younger people on my team, I find they do more inspired work, so I decided to take on a final year work term placement from the local university and if they work out then give them a job offer. Anyway to make a very long process short I interviewed and hired a very smart girl for the work term and made it known that if her work was good then she may get a job offer after she graduates in a few months. 

She's excellent at her job, and very promising, she could go far in her career. I've been having weekly meetings with her for like 20 minutes or a half hour to just see how she's doing, and how she's fitting in. I do it with all new people on the team for the first few months. In our last meeting yesterday she told me that she's transgender, she wasn't going to tell anyone but she was worried that if it somehow came out that it would effect her getting offered the job and she wanted to let me know. I was a little shocked.

She's very pretty, easily the most beautiful girl in the office, I've had to have a talk with several of the guys in the office and one on my own team about sexual harassment because of her. When I talked to her (prior to her telling me about being transgender) and told her that I talked to the few people who were making passes at her she told me it wasn't an issue and she could handle it. After she told me about being transgender she told me she didn't want anyone else to know, I told her she should let HR know in case of any issues but she didn't want to. I assured her not to worry about getting offered the job, if she kept up with the quality of work that she was doing it was hers. 

Basically I just need some help with what I should be doing as a boss. She's a great employee so far, and her personality fits in well with the rest of the team... smart and kind of awkward (we are engineers). I don't want to make her uncomfortable or feel unsupported. Is there anything special I need to know or do, should I let HR know anyway, any different accommodations that she may need? All I hear about from the US is bathroom stuff, our bathrooms are unisex so that's not an issue. I'm just trying to be a good boss to her and all my people, so I guess I'm just wondering what I need to know and what may come up in the future so that I can get out in front of it before it becomes an issue.

Thanks in advance!"
hayley90,asktransgender,MtF voice surgery - An alternative to Yeson (particularly for those in Europe). I had glottoplasty with Prof Marc Remacle in Luxembourg two weeks ago. This is my outcome...,"A bit of background, I had about 9 months of speech therapy and couldn't get my voice to pass so I had CTA done at the same time as having my adams apple removed.

Whilst CTA helped, my voice was still not passable, especially on the phone, and my voice was the only thing that was giving me away as being trans.

I had thought about going to Yeson but then also noticed that there was Haben doing the same surgery in New York.

I spoke to my speech therapist and she recommended Prof Marc Remacle who was doing it in Luxembourg.

There's not much info on him but I found a thread on Susan's with a few patients of his who shared their experiences and voice recordings.

I had my surgery just over 2 weeks ago and had 15 days of voice rest following the surgery.  I started talking again on Friday last week and I haven't been able to say much but did manage to do a recording today.

This is a recording of my voice on 9 October 2016:

http://vocaroo.com/i/s0o9T4M4twea

Using Praat, it gives an average pitch of 182Hz

and this is a recording of my voice today:

http://vocaroo.com/i/s1MPrTdDnKMN

Praat give an average of 295Hz for this recording so it seems that I have gained about 100Hz, which I'm so pleased with!

Right now, that recording is about all that I can say and I don't want to say too much at this stage whilst it's still healing.  I cant really control resonance right now and volume is a bit hard to control, but I'm also purposely not pushing my voice louder than I want to.

If you're from Europe and considering voice surgery then I highly recommend looking into doing it with Prof Remacle.

I'm so pleased with the outcome and can't wait for it to fully heal! :)"

[deleted],asktransgender,I think I might be transgender.,"I'm 18 years old. I don't know the term I should use for this but I was born as a girl. Is there a better term for that? Because I don't like wording it that way.

I wouldn't say my interests are really masculine but at the same time they're not too feminine either. Like when I was growing up, I was preferring gender neutral toys and hobbies. I wouldn't have worn a dress in my life but less feminine clothing instead. My family always called me a tomboy as I wasn't interested in playing with dolls or dressing up or any of that. I know hobbies and interests aren't the same as gender but I say this all just in case anyone was wondering.

I started exclusively dressing as a guy and presenting as a guy during my gymnasium years. I wasn't denying being a gal whenever someone called me that, but I was trying to get people to call me a guy. I was questioning my sexuality because of this even though I only like men. I introduced myself with a male name to new people. There was something satisfying about being called a guy and I don't know what it was. 

But I really think I want to be exclusively known as a guy. Whenever I get called a girl, I feel like I... failed somehow? I don't know how transition works yet, but I'm thinking, I want my voice to be deep and I want to be able to grow facial hair. I want to get my name changed to a male name and remove my breasts. I never really thought of this as being transgender, but fuck, it probably is.

I used to be transphobic as fuck too. I used to troll trans people on the internet by making jokes like attack helicopters, which you could say was incredibly hypocritical, because I was still doing that when I was purposely presenting myself as male.

So, does this mean I'm transgender, for sure? Even if I don't want to have a penis instead of what I already have? I'd like to keep my current private parts. Do I require to change them to be transgender or to transition to male?

Also, any advice for me to tell this to my family? I don't know if they're specifically transphobic because they never talked about trans issues. They seem accepting of LGB. But they're xenophobic in other matters so you never know...

Thanks for reading, sorry if the questions were really cliche and boring, I mainly made this thread to vent. Didn't know where else it would fit. Cheers, friends!"
Filmting,asktransgender,A story on buying pizza.,"I needed to write this, and I want to share it.

Buying Pizza...

You would be suprised by how heart breaking and difficult is is to do simple tasks, like buying pizza.

This is the experience you go through everytime. Well, least the first time, the next time
its the same, but less intense.

You have your daily realization of how shit your life is. You desire a delicous,
friggin pizza to eat. A small comfort in the daily difficulties of your existence,
a luxery you cannot afford, but a neccesity you need, espically on the really dark days.
So you accept a week of only pasta at the end of the month, for a small simple joy, to
brigthen your life, if only for a moment.

You realize you need to go outside in order to acquire this sumptuous meal, and
before you can even consider revealing your disgusting body in the suns light,
for random strangers on the street to behold, you need to prepare yourself.

First order of business is that abominable bush on your face. A straight giveaway of your
masculinity, an aggravating den of hideous malevoence, a dark blight upon your face, growing faster then
the scourging of lordaeron, which of course you havn't shaved since the morning.

You go out, and moisturize your face with all kinds of water, soap, shampoo and what have you,
shaving it twice, once with, once against the grain, to get that every last inch of hair, which
of course you fail at. There's always the lumbering little demons you can feel scratching your
hand across your face, as well and the dark shade upon your skin, reminding you, that your actions
to be rid of your beard are futile and in vain, only to be repeated again in the morning.

You can keep slicing and dicing your face with the razor, resisting the temptation to slice your
throat with it, to attempt to get every last little demon, or instead surrender to the darkness, and live
with your demons, praying to the omnipitent flying spaghetti monster nobody notices them.

The next order of business is to cover the remainder of your face in all sorts of beauty products,
a last ditch effort, not to maximize beauty, but perhaps suppress and quell the lurking darkness
of your masculine features.

You go to town, not knowing what the fuck you are doing, and end up with something that looks like a 
robot more then human. An uncanny valley type of face, furthermore chastising your not meant to wear this product.
You look like some comedy sit-com episode, a guy wearing makeup, an utter joke belonging at a festival or
at a circus, instead of the beautiful, serious and genuine woman you want to be seen as.

You put on your happy face, a charade that comes easy to you, with a lifetime of experience. An attempt
to accept that this is alright, and after smiling at the square spongebob of your face in the mirror for a while, searching for the
small glimpse of femiminity to smile back at you, and tell you, it's okay to move on.

If it is not found, the journey ends, and you surrender, to perhaps try again after some procrastination.
Once you have given yourself acceptance, you try on your wardrope. You are searching for something that
screams to the world you are a girl, but can also withstand the freezing cold weather outside. You realize
that your wardrope does not contain this, and after trying all your clothes 3 diffrent times, you settle on something,
unsure still, if it's the right choice, put your womans bag around your shoulder, and head out the door, after some
day dreaming in the mirror. Dreaming of how beautiful you could become, once you get started on them drugs, which
are unessecarily being blocked from you. An unpleasant frustration, you diffuse and move on.

It's now been least half and hour, if not a full, and you arrive in the outside world, of the street outside
your appartment. Crippling fear, rises in your body, as you realize, somebody might fucking see you, a thought
that obviously crossed your mind, but burrowed and postponed for your later self, while you were busy preparing.

You want to scream, hide, run back inside and give up. But your charade, as masterful and experienced it is, holds
your hand, and causes the two hairy pinetrees you stand on to step fourth towards your destination. You don't even
think about why you are walking, and the delicous price, awaiting you at the end of your journey. You just walk, searching
everywhere for somebody to judge you, scream at you, tell you that you are a fake, and then stab you in the gut.

It never happens, however half the people you come across stares at you, and every inch of your soul is still prepared to die,
a constant anxiousness, always on alert.

When you reach your pizzaeria, you soon begin to realize the next biggest and dreaded thing. YOU WILL HAVE TO SPEAK!

You have not prepared for this, and while you have practiced your voice feminization, it still scream guy. You sound
somewhat passable back in the warm comfort of your isolated nuked toilet in which you precide, but you have not practiced
this for a real life setting, let alone made humming sounds and recided the alphabeat on your way to the pizzaeria, to
get your pitch in the right place for the conversation.

You are again tempted to flee, hesitant of entering. You lurk around outside, while brimming with panic, but sharply
and instantly refocuses yourself, and just goes in and does it, your body pushing you fourth, while your mind is still
screaming for help at the sitation.

You are aksed what you want, a decision that was made before your journey. You somehow instantly forget everything else in the
world, and focus all of your efforts and attention in the next line of dialogue comming out of your mouth, as if confessing to
murder to a judge, 2 policemen, the victims, the pope, and your friends and familiy at the same time.

""Number 29"".

Yes, you did it! It wasn't great, but it was acceptable. You are in approval of your sentence, and how well clean and formulated it
was, and your body starts to relax. Like a release of dorphine, the settling ease and satisfaction similar to when you pee, overtakes
you.

""What?"" it person behind the counter says.

""FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK   YYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"".
Your mind screams with such anger and fervor, and you attempt again.

""Number 29"".

Some random fucking guy says. An ugly hideous voice that isn't yours. Your normal unfocused voice, a reminder yet again you fail at being female,
a reminder that it is only a charade, that you are a fake, and should stay hidden away from the world.

""10 Minutes.""

The person behind the counter says, while fucking smiling at you. The audacity. You sit and scream, and cry at the same time, contemplating
what you could have done diffrently, silenty murming to yourself and doing your humming pratice, such that nobody can hear, sometimes not
even yourself.

There you sit, brimming with hatred and sorrow, thinking at last, least you will have your meal. You are flooded
with so many spirals and roads of reflection and deliberation, none of which ever reach the end, when they finally bring your pizza fourth.

They hand it over to you, and the very next words that come out of their mouth, hurts your soul to the core.

""Here you go, sir.""

Your heart breaks, shatters, contracts, like you just been shot in the stomach, your face breaks down, and you immediealty want
to cry. You don't want questions, dont want to make a scence, so you hold it back, take the pizza, a pointless object in the grand
scheme of things, you no longer care about. You flee as hastily as you can to the comfort of your home...

Once you are there, you break down into tears, put the pizza on the table, but for all you care, might as well throw it in
the garbage. You only linger for the comfort of your bed now, wanting to hide yourself under your sheets, curl up on foster position,
and cry and sleep the remainder of the day away...

Least you got pizza right?

Things would be so much easier if I wasn't trans, and I don't seem to have too much of a problem as I am right now, (At least if it wasn't for my constant questioning) so why do I feel this way?

It's gotten to the point where I would want to die if I found out I wasn't trans, but if I was trans I'd have a lot more problems, so I might want to die then too. I've never heard of any trans person that has felt like I have, as most of them had some problem with being male.

The fact that I get so upset by the idea of not being trans should mean that I am trans, but the fact that I seem to have little to no problems as a male (That are or could be related to gender) says otherwise. "

Once I started HRT a few months ago this habit (which I hadn't previously associated with gender trouble or dysphoria or anything) abruptly stopped.  Yesterday was my first throwback since.

While filling up a water bottle, I start reflecting on the changes in my life.  I've become much happier, but how has that been dependent on beginning transition? I could stop hormones, keep dressing the same way, keep my new friends and my new healthier habits. Nothing in my life that's changed seems dependent in any major or minor way on me being an estrogen-creature perceived consistently as a woman.

MtF here, I'll be starting HRT around June of this year and the thoughts that I share below seem to get stronger the closer I get.

Lately I've been having a weird sense of what I find to be attractive in the sexual sense and the ""I want to look like that/have that type of style, etc."" sense. The general way I want to look (which is including like styles and stuff I have no idea where I'll end up I just want to have a proper body that I can feel comfortable in, but as far as style, etc.) I also find sexually attractive? (Although I don't think I'm a very sexual person and this isn't what first pops in my mind about it, but it is still present when I do). Is this a normal thing or is this weird? I even had this back when I just figured I was a bi cisman instead of a bi transwoman. Like back then I would just go for whatever style and look that I found sexually attractive on men because at the time I hated myself (because I was burying my transness hard for years) so I would just emulate whatever I found attractive in a guy because I figured well I find it attractive I guess others will too and maybe I'll even like how I feel and look. But it would just never work out that way, I still felt shitty and out of place (as many of us do but I'm just trying to give relation to what I feel now). Now I do want to clarify though, that I find people and styles that I find attractive that I don't want to emulate also, and I never want to emulate men I find attractive, but in pretty much every circumstance when thinking about how I want to look, dress, style, etc. if I think of it in a sexual context I find it sexually attractive, if that makes sense.

So now even though I haven't started HRT and I am still boymode, every little thing I do towards my transition makes me feel a little better about myself which I have never really felt before. But even with this in mind, whenever I think about how I want my hair to be styled and what clothing I'm going to wear and my general ""style"" I also find that style to be sexually attractive on others, does that make sense? Although I am someone who my ""style"" preference changes a lot, but I just realized that this might have been the case in the past (which is what I'm referencing to when I say ""changes a lot"") because I kept trying to be comfortable with my male body but never could and just tried a whole lot of ways to be comfortable with it that all failed.

It is the same thing for sexual fantasies. I have stopped watching porn for about 1-2 months now and I have to say that for at least me personally, that has been a very good decision and I don't think I'm ever going back (I had a legitimate problem and it made my dysphoria worse). But I point this out because I still masturbate, but for years now and completely 100% now that I came out as trans, I have only masturbated to minimize erections and prevent unstimulated discharge like from ""wet dreams"" etc. This is mostly because I personally feel literally violated when I get an erection it is that dysphoric for me. But since I want to get masturbation out of the way when I do it as quickly as possible (which I have literally found a weekly schedule to masturbate as little as possible while still minimizing erections, etc.) and I don't watch porn, I typically have to fantasize especially since I have had such a long history of watching porn. Now when I was closeted (including to myself) when fantasizing I would always think about the other person(s) and never myself or what I would be doing because I didn't give a shit about myself only about pleasuring others. But now, I feel like when fantasizing I think as much about myself if not more than anyone else that would be in the fantasy. Now I'm not saying that I think me being trans is a fetish or some other ignorant view, as I know this is not the case because I would gladly never masturbate again if I could without causing me other dismay and my thoughts and wanting of it never stop and just happen to be incorporated because of that into my sexual thoughts. But I do feel like I am almost fetishizing myself some how? I don't know if that is the case or if this is normal and I am over thinking it? Maybe I just happen to be comfortable enough with the thought of myself with my proper body that I am now finally focusing on myself more in these fantasies?

Is this me just starting to get more comfortable with myself/the thought of my transitioned self that I am for the first time having a healthy relationship with myself in a sexual environment? Or is this a bit of a red flag that I should try to figure out more? Any thoughts would be appreciated!"

Would you recommend them? And if so, why do you recommend them?

zyrtsuryu,asktransgender,Breast buds after ~8mo AA's only?,"I couldn't find any information on this specific situation. Its **got** to be out there, but any search brings up bigger, more common pages.

I am 26 years old, MtF. I have been on Spironolactone alone, 200mg daily for 9 weeks now. I go to my endo in a month to start E (AAs first was my idea). So far I feel good. Sex drive is down, but more importantly now after weeks of not masturbating like I used to I feel healthier and well-rounded. I love not getting erections all the time. They still happen, but its whatever. I have changed my entire underwear drawer over to women's underwear, and for the first time in my life I feel like my body parts are on board with that decision. My skin has been thinner since about 4-5 weeks in, and my BO has been pretty much nil since week 3. I'm more susceptible to cold now, but my BMI is also smack dab in the middle of underweight. I chalk the cold up to metabolism slowing a little and skin thinning. At least northern hemisphere summer is coming. Hey, my hair is finally long enough to put in a proper ponytail!

About 2 weeks ago, I was at work and accidentally discovered that my right nipple was sore! Touching or grazing it felt sensitive but not painful. Pressing it or rubbing it over my rib (I'm skinny) hurt like a bruise does! It was a surprise to say the least. I didn't expect to have to deal with this yet, but now that its here I just want the other nipple to start! I understand unevenness is very common. I still wish it wasn't uneven, though.

Now its 2 weeks later. Lefty is starting to get itchy and sometimes hurts, but its all very elusive. For the most part it looks and acts like a male nipple. Righty has a hardish, round cylinder/flat ball under the nipple, and is noticeably raised up compared to the left one. It only has changed directly under the nipple.

My question is: Has anyone else had breast bud(s) start when they were only on Antiandrogens? What does this mean for my chances of decent growth once I start Estrogen? I'd love to hear about everyone else.

I had blood work done once, before I took my first pill, so I don't have current levels to give. I'm sure I'll take another blood test in a month.

lillybaeum,asktransgender,Weirdness with E - bit of advice?,"I started on 0.10mg dermal per day, or so I was supposed to!

But it turns out the generic brand I got was prescribed incorrectly, and I was taking double what I was supposed to, by following the instructions of 1 patch on friday on right side, one on tuesday on left side. So effectively I was getting 0.20mg per day.

I got my perscription fixed, went a day or so without estrogen, and put on my 0.05mg patch last night, with my other 0.05mg patch to be put on next tuesday and both switched out weekly, so I will be getting the proper 0.10mg per day now.

My question is how does this affect my body and is there anything I should keep in mind? In addition I've been on 200mg spiro BID, and see my doctor in a couple weeks or so.

I definitely notice effects (mostly mental but also some physical!) and I'm not complaining but I'm just curious if there's anything I should know about such wildly fluctuating levels of medication."
HiImRebecca,asktransgender,Questions about blood test,"I got my 3 months blood sample taken on Tuesday, and most of my results are available today, which has raised a few questions for me!

My FSH and LH are both &lt;0.1 IU/L (was 3.8 and 5.2 before HRT respectively), but I saw in another thread that it's a good thing. Right?

My prolactin have gone up from 145 to 373 x 10^(-3) IU/L, and the reference values goes from 59 - 304, so it's definitely too high! Does that cause any issues?

SHBG has gone up from 17 to 41 nmol/L, which is now within the reference values (18 - 144), so that should be a good thing.

Testosterone is marked with ""*****"", which means that I'll get the result later, but for some reason, estradiol isn't marked like that, and there's no results for it, so I guess they didn't test for that this time? I feel like that would be very important to know, so it freaks me out a bit! Hoping they just forgot to put the *s and that they'll add it later anyways, but should I try calling the Gynecological Clinic next week to figure out, what's up with that, or should I just wait and assume they'll check it at my 5½ months blood test? :o"

Today I told my manager that I am transgender, and as expected he was great! Not only is he a great guy, but Starbucks as a company really seems to appreciate their employees. I am pretty happy I am working for them.

Anyways, my boss told me that not only are there a plethora of things that the company offers to transgendered partners; but that there are also groups of transgender Starbucks employees I could contact. I did a relatively quick search online about this, but couldn't find too much. I don't know if any of you know much about their policies, groups, or health insurance; but my hope is that there are a few of you that may! If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it :) Also I haven't figured out the store I am planning on transferring to yet, anybody have suggestions of a few good stores in the greater Boston area I could look into?

FUgenderroles,asktransgender,"So, I might not have dysphoria after all","Since I've started having these transgender thoughts around August 2016, I discovered this sub, and I started feeling a bit dysphoric.




Do I want to be born female? Yes. Am I just overreacting over being AMAB? Probably. Am I just a crossdresser who wants to be born female just because I can wear womens clothes without looking weird? Probably.




I don't know anymore. Yes, I'd rather of been born female, but that doesn't make me transgender or dysphoric. I've been crossdressing in private since I was 12, but several years years later it's only starting to make me feel uncomfortable.




The more I am out of the house, less trans I feel. The more time I spend alone, the worse I feel. About a month ago I had 2 weeks off, I spent most of that time in my bedroom alone, I was getting suicidal, I'd shake in anger for being AMAB and not AFAB. I think that I hate presenting as male when I am alone, but when it actually comes to it it's fine. 


I go to college most days. When I am there, I completely forget I am trans. I don't care I was born AMAB. I'd like to wear female clothes, but not so fussed about a female body as much. I'm not sure if I'd rather be seen as male/female/other. 



It's like I've managed to convince myself I am transgender, I've manged to convince myself that these feelings I have is gender dysphoria but I am a crossdresser who is a little over the top and taking it way to seriously.



What could I do? I know therapy is one, but I'm at collage and I don't really have the money to. I have no clue anymore. These feelings I've been having that I have that I thought was gender dysphoria was just me being over the top about this whole situation."

And she's really cool, she's like one of the first Girls i've truly connected with.

And, sometimes I just want to give her a compliment. Nothing too big a deal, and she knows I'm not attracted to girls, so there's no confusion there. But when I actually go to say something, I hesitate. 

It isn't that big of a deal, but she's really pretty and I hope she knows that, so I'd try to make her feel good. But I find myself scared to do so. Not because I care about what people around me at school think. To hell with that.

Like today, she was wearing an outfit that was SO CUTE, and I really wanted to say something, and, as the class was leaving the room for lunch, I said ""Hey Anon, I really like your outfit."". But I guess I said it too quite or too fast and she didn't hear me correctly. So she said ""What did you say?"" and I just replied with ""nothing..."" and dropped it.

Maybe a part of me thinks it's creepy and I should keep my mouth shut because I have no right to talk like a girl. But it's not creepy Is it?

I think my friend looks pretty, and I really admire how she dresses or does her nails. That's all. And she knows I'm basically a girl, and has no issue with that at all. If anything we're closer because I came out.

Secondly, I'd have to explain the futanari concept to those unfamiliar with it and I'm worried they'd think I'm a pervert or something. Help?"
BrandiBeats,asktransgender,Can sex increase Testosterone? (MtF),"I apologize that this only pertains to MtFs, but this seemed like the best place to ask.
Can a sudden increase in sexual arousal and having sex cause your T levels to increase?  I have been pretty steady, hovering around 30 ng/dl.  Then I met a girl �� She really gets me turned on, and we had been sexually active for only a few weeks when I got my levels checked.  My T had spiked to 130 ng/dl.  This is the first time I've been with someone since starting HRT.  Anyone experience this, or think that this is possible?"

MTFtransthrowaway123,asktransgender,Avoid Dr Webberley and gendergp,"So ive been trying to get on hrt for months now. I was going to go private but was told to go see dr webberly first as it was the safer and eventually cheaper option. That was about 4 or 5 months ago now.

It started of great. I would send an email and get a reply within a few hours. The maximum would be 12 hours. Now it takes a week to get a reply.
After about 3 months with them they said they would send me my prescription.  So i paid for it and was really excited.  About 5 or so days passed and i got an email saying that i wasnt getting my prescription and that i would need to go meet dr webberly. 

So i had to pay £100 to talk to her for 30 minutes. Also the earliest appointment they had was just over 5 weeks away. I had already had almost the exact same conversation but in more depth about 2 months prior but it was for about an hour, with a councillor and laid out better. 

Also when i asked if i would get a refund for the money i had paid for the prescription i was ignored. When i asked again i was told to just cancel my ongoing prescription so it wouldnt charge me again.  So no, i wasnt getting a refund.

Now they want me to speak to one of their councillor.  They wont tell me for how long they want me too either.
In total i think ive paid them about £300, because im joining the military i have to be on hormones for at least 6 months before i join so ive just wasted quite a few months and im no closer to why i went to them in the first place. So i would strongly urge anyone reading this to stay away from them. Im now just going to buy online. 

Jeez i had to get that out of my system. They made me so annoyed."
_Amoeva,asktransgender,MTF Changes schedule on low dose,"Hi, trans woman here,

I began HRT 14 days ago, and I'm sooo impatient to feel the little breast buds. Nothing of that kind appeared for now. I only feel that my libido decreased and I don't get anymore undesired erections. 

Since I'm on low dose (50mg cypro + 2mg estradiol), could you give me an approximation of when I'm going to see them appear ? 

Also, my endocrinologist prescribes me this dose for two months, and I would rather see the changes quickly. Do you think I could call him to ask him if I can double the E pills ? 

Maybe I worry for nothing and everyone begins with this dosage and increase it after two months for example. 

Thank you for if you share your experience :) "

MaybeAllieRae,asktransgender,Changing jobs mid-transition - dilemma,"BLUF:  What do I do about interviewing and searching for a new job mid-transition?

I am currently about 9 months into full dose HRT (14 months total) but not out yet at work except to one person.  I am still presenting male and aside from family and some friends, nobody knows.  I haven't hid my non-straight sexual identity so most people think I'm just gay.  I haven't told them that I was gay, just that I have a rainbow flag on my cubical and wear a rainbow bracelet, among other things.  

Anyway, my current job is kind of a mixed bag.  I really like the people I work with and for, the commute is really good (~20 min by car), I'm only 5 minutes from my kids and can pick them up from school/be there for school events very easily, the schedule is typical 9-5 but flexible, and the pay is decent.  BUT, I'm SO BORED! I'm often sitting on my hands waiting for someone else to do something so I have something to do and when I do ask for something new, there's not much to do.

So, I started looking for a new job and got an interview. The problems are many...  One is that I know I'm going to be coming out to everyone this year and don't want to delay anything.  I've also been growing my hair out for over a year and I don't want to cut it to interview looking very MALE.  This job is in NYC and would greatly increase my commute by at least 200% as well as almost eliminate any flexibility in my schedule.

I am so torn about taking the interview.  Has anyone had a similar issue?  What did you do?  What do you think I should do???"
SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,Is there anything I can do about my anxiety caused by.. down there?,"Ever since my BDD has been improving and my appearance has been feminizing more and more my dysphoria related to my body has been.. well disappearing, that is... except my genitals. It's been getting far worse down there.

I've explained countless times, when I do a loose or tight tuck I start feeling pain and discomfort down there, this makes me aware something isn't right down there and I start having moments of panic... and if I untuck and leave the bulge the moment I start noticing it I go into an even worse panic. I literally cannot live and function like this and it's making things incredibly difficult... My brain knows there's something extra down there that doesn't belong.

I can't see a psychologist until late March, it's the soonest they could schedule me. I really, really need help here.. my dysphoria was bad but it was never this bad and I just need general advice to cope with it.

If I so much as see my own genitals I start freaking out, feeling them has a delayed reaction and is so far what I do for tucking and cleaning it.. although I try to make the movements quick so the anxiety doesn't kick in.

An inclusive way for the guys to be involved in this question could be if they feel similar to the way I do but they know something is 'missing' down there."
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,"I know it sounds weird, but transitioning feels kinda like experiencing a gender-bender manga irl.","As in title, it feels like that for me, and I'm wondering if it does for anyone else.

I've just read ""Nozomu Nozomi"" and it was so relatable that I couldn't stop reading it. Like, hiding changes from your parents and people around you, dealing with the new stuff and slowly getting used as your true gender (it also has FtM character, so if you want guys, you can check it out). 

Of course, it's based on change of sex parts so that's unrealistic and they don't mention dysphoria but other stuff like for example, my old t-shirts feel like a bag (even to the point that my old PE shirts are falling off my shoulder!), not being able to hide breasts anymore at all, feeling more delicate and fragile (and also shorter).

It's also weird because I feel like a double agent. I never know if I'll pass or fail (I'm staying in boymode, even though people are staring at me), and recently I noticed that my voice sounds feminine while sneezing, coughing etc.

Also I turned 20 about 2 months ago, but I definitely don't feel like it. I feel like 14 or so, and people say that I look like 16 (when I was 18, people thought that I'm 14 lol). It's quite common in overall, but discovering all this stuff about how your umm, body, works makes me feel like I'm back in a middle school again.

So yeah, I've been just wondering about that."

fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,In some ways I feel worse when I'm less dysphoric?,"When I'm less dysphoric (like right now) I actually feel worse when I'm more dysphoric. 



When I'm less dysphoric, I don't know what I am, I feel like this is a passing phase, or that I'm forcing myself to be female. I know a lot of people try and distract themselves from the dysphoria as it makes them feel better. For me it's the reverse. 



When I'm more dysphoric, I think that transitioning is the best option, that I am doing the right choice by transitioning, and I can imagine being female which I really like. At times I feel suicidal when I'm more dysphoric, but I actually know what I want and what's right for me. 



Like right now, I feel like that I'm just more of a confused male. I feel like I'm forcing myself to be like this. I was completely fine 6 months ago, but I'm not now. Being male is so much easier, I don't have to deal with transitioning. 



Living in the closet is actually kind of nice in someways. No one doesn't think anything different of me, everyone sees me as just any other guy, no one sees me as trans, I'm just like any other human on the street.

seansuxx,asktransgender,Do I even have dysphoria?,"When I was little, I was always sad. Always moping around like this little sad boy. I was happy when I was alone in my little world. I was bullied for being feminine &amp; asked by almost anyone who met me if I was gay. I watched other people experience growing up and I always had this thing in the back of my head that made me feel so old. I didnt fit in anywhere. I felt so negative &amp; beat down. My mom took me to 1000 therapists but I would never open up to them. I was attracted to boys and I was so uncomfortable with my body.

Fast forward to 14, I'm unable to focus in class because I'm zoning out constantly (as I had been doing my entire life), I go to therapy &amp; they give me antidepressants &amp; a stimulant. I can't handle being around other people because it makes me so anxious. My life improved drastically. For a bit. But then I become obsessed with schoolwork and that becomes my identity. All I did was do schoolwork &amp; go home. I didnt care about anything. About to turn 16, I am in the bathtub screaming because I have intrusive thoughts that won't get out of my head. None were gender related. Suddenly a switch goes off and I start to feel nothing. I realize that I'm completely dead on the inside when I'm 16. I am completely cut off from my emotions. At 17, I go off my meds because I want to return to the old, less-emotionally numb &amp; socially anxious me: I thought that was the solution. I end up running around my house blasted with anxiety and anger. I trash my parents house because they want me to stay on my meds (great idea!) &amp; go to a male detention centre. I woke up the next day with so much stress, I woke up in a traumatic state that I haven't really recovered from. When I'm 18, I start feeling like I'm living in a dream world. I read an article ""I didnt know I was transgender"" and my mind starts to race. From then on, all I've thought was about gender. I start wearing makeup in public and notice I'm calmer. I crossdress a bit, but mostly when I'm stoned. I go on HRT, become emotionally unstable and i'm unable to leave my house.

Now, I'm 19. I'm in a constant state of emptiness and anxiety. Going through the motions of life &amp; I'm sick of it. I want to experience life. Everything feels robotic since I'm 14. I'm watching people grow older, get cancer, go in and out of phases and I'm still the same sad, sarcastic 14 year old. 

I can add up all the little moments in my life and realize intellectually that I'm trans but cant emotionally accept it. &amp; The possibility of me being nonbinary and not being validated for that horrifies me. I have spent five years really just doing nothing but escaping into music and worlds in my head. Always escaping the overwhelming stress and anxiety I felt all of the time. Putting makeup on last summer really felt stress relieving. I felt grounded in my body when I shaved my legs &amp; when I put makeup on. When I was little I would put female underwear on and feel soooo relieved for once in my f**king life.

I recently shaved my head eyebrows and eyelashes off after growing them out for 1,5 years. I feel soooooo more drowning/paranoid in public now that I did that, more than I ever have in a while. I feel like I'm drowning and no one can save me. I did it to piss my mom off because she got mad at me.. I'm really emotionally unstable. 

The estrogen is making me soooo emotional but I don't want to go off &amp; age like a man. 

Im always escaping reality for a very long time, ignoring dealing with myreal life issues and emotions. Blasting music. Overeating to soothe myself. For 5 years. 

Life doesnt feel real. It feels robotic and fake.. Nothing makes me feel anything. It keeps moving on. I want to start living. I felt dysphoria when I was younger but now I feel completely numb. "

I tell her it's a body thing and how people perceive me as male that I don't like. She is supportive and understanding and is trying very hard to educate herself on the matters of transess but just doesn't seem fully 'convinced' be cause of my interests. I tell her that has nothing to do with it, women can do all the things that men can do and they do them in the real world, e.g a mechanic. I know I don't need to try and convince her but she seems to be missing all the 'signs' that something was up during my childhood.

zauraz,asktransgender,A stupid thought,"I have written a lot recently and something akin this not too long ago..

Ever since a stupid, old guard psychiatrist prevented me from getting access to a referral for gender therapy along constantly blatantly telling me ""you are a beautiful boy"" etc I have felt like shit. But one thing he told me has made me think in a pattern that is stupid, unproductive and ridiculous.

I have never been in a relationship and together with bullying, being frozen out and pressure around around the year of 15 to get into a relationship has caused me to feel like shit. People around me are now getting into relationships and I know its a mutual thing. Back to my doctor however, he told me, that I should have sex. That maybe that would help me get over this. The same words were echoed months ago by my supporting parents who now knows better but back then my mom asked me to find my role by maybe trying to be in a relationship..

All this constant pressure from all around on having a relationship is getting to me. My granddad have always teased me about girls, my mother kept asking me to ask a girl out for prom last year and now even my best friend which got a girlfriend and I am really happy for wake feelings of sadness, hopelessness and selfhatred in me. Valentines day is a hell to go through and there are relationships forming everywhere around me. I know I am not alone but I lack any real chances of getting into one, especially considering my trans status. I have tried ignoring it and coping with it like most other singles seems to do but it constantly comes back to me....

A stupid thought therefore reawakened inside me. Maybe I am just trying to be a girl because I have never been in a relationship and it generally seems like girls are having an easier time getting into ones? But that feels absurd and wrong but I can't let go of the idea that maybe I am not trans and just a bother.....

I don't know what to do except feel like shit whenever I am reminded of my ""singleness"" and the fear of never having a relationship as trans is scaring me to hell, especially considering that I am most likely a lesbian.. The idea of being a lesbian feels hard to explain to others as they will probably just ask me why I can't be male and love girls but something about being a girl with a girl feels a lot more ""right"" to me. I am currently feeling wrong, abnormal and a burden to everyone around me....

I've put myself back together, tried to carry on as a man that my family always wanted me to be, a steel toe wearing American. But that's not me, it never was it never will be. I knew I was transgender since I was in middle school, all the boys would call me faggot everyday, they would bully me and taunt me.. but I found harmony in playing video games, I could be a female in a virtual world and no one would know the wiser.. then I came of age, stepped out into the real world, with a job and got lost. That's when I turned to therapy, I confessed my inner thoughts to my therapist, she pressure me into coming out to my mother, and I did. She did not take it well, telling me that I would burn in hell, and that I was her son not her daughter. So I gave up, and I went on with my life, depressed and broken. Then I found a new therapist and tried yet again, and the same thing happened. So I set out to do this myself, I kept
My head down, didn't mention anything to my family, got a good paying job, and I started saving.

At that time my Doctor will prescribe hormones, I've come out at work, and people don't seem to care. I'm very optimistic for my future, and I want to keep pushing forward, I'm young and I have my entire life ahead of me.

I never really felt like a man, I'm small, coming in at 120lbs, 5'10, size 8 shoes, hardly any body hair, and a baby face.. minus the facial hair which I'm working on removing. I was always bullied, small and weak in the body, but not in the mind. I've experienced a lot in this life, I lost my brother to a motorcycle accident, I watched my father attempt suicide, and I know life is too short and fragile to not be happy.

RockerBoyGirl,asktransgender,Is it possible to be in denial about your desire to be (target gender)?,"Often I will see people who have a desire to be (target gender) and other signs of being trans but are in denial about being trans in general. In my case, during my midteens I had a strong desire to be a girl (Amab) for a few years. This included common trans stuff like praying every night, etc. Eventually I stopped as a result of nothing happening and I don't know if I unintentionally repressed it or it just disappeared, but that desire seems to go away. Is it possible I'm in denial of having the desire itself?"

I used to get dysphoria looking at mirrors, but now it's mainly a ""hey, I like myself now!"" feeling...

Overall, things were looking up... until I saw this random photo of me, and I couldn't help but notice how different and more physically masculine (I'm mtf) I looked compared to myself in the mirror. and it wasn't one of those grainy mobile photos, so I can't blame it on photo quality either.

Like... ugh. I know this is so very silly and stupid, but it feels like my entire self esteem and self confidence just completely blew away, and now I'm extremely dysphoric again and really sad and unsure of how I actually look in real life.

tomatoes-comatose,asktransgender,"So I'm starting trying to voice change, some questions...","Well, after a year of procrastinating, i decided to finally start trying to do something concrete about voice change. I had a few questions

1. Permanence - will the new voice become too permanent such that my male voice is strained and tough to manage? I don't plan on transitioning, if at all, until my 30s, so I don't really want to end up with an all male body with a squeaky girl voice by default.

2. [I'm using this method, starting today](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ske7b/mtf_voice_training_regimen/) and step one and two I figured is the phase I should be doing now. 
2a I can't breathe at all when I hold up my larynx after swallowing. What can I do about that?

   2B (or not 2B) When do I know about going to the next step?


3. Is there anything quicker I can do about the voice? What kind of regimen do I follow?

Is it even advisable for me, what with my planned male (albeit not very masculine) presentation until I'm older?

Haishi7,asktransgender,Is my mother the cause that i am trans ?,"My grandma once told me when i was like 9 years old that when my mother was pregnant of me she always told them that she wanted a girl and the day she knew i was a biologically a ""boy"" she was depressed and crying for a month.

Could that be the reason why i am transgender ?"
Transmightafuckedup,asktransgender,Might have outed myself on reddit. What do?,"Making this post on a throwaway because I'm paranoid that family might have found and be monitoring my main account. 

I'm an MtF in her thirties and I post on reddit fairly regularly.  Recently, I had to fly home for the first time in a long time to deal with a family emergency.  I'm not close to my family, and hadn't even spoken to them in years, so they didn't know I was trans and I saw no reason to tell them.  Spent the whole week in boymode.

So, while I was there, family was all ""We need to get back in touch again!  Let's blah blah blah see each other, text, send emails, call, etc.""  And it was pretty great.

And now, I've been back for two weeks, and have heard NOTHING.  I've sent a couple emails and texts; no reply.

And today it occurred to me, that while I was there, I made a post on a local pro sports team subreddit that I've followed for a while about the family emergency, asking for prayers and stuff.  It got voted pretty high and was the top post in the subreddit for a time.

And I just now realized that I have one family member who is about my age, very tech savvy, and a season-ticket-holding fan of the same sports team.  So it is *very plausible he has a reddit and follows that same subreddit.*  The post about the family emergency was specific enough that anyone who knew me would *know* it was me.  And if you click my username, my post history is loaded with talk about the HRT I'm taking and bunches of pictures of me as a girl.

So now it's 2 AM and I'm awake and wracked with worry that I fucked up and now my whole family thinks I'm a sick freak and that's why they're not talking to me.

It's also possible they've all just totally forgotten that I exist, like they did before the family emergency.  But this scenario - dude having a reddit, dude seeing my post in his front page and being like ""Wtf, is that XXXXX's reddit?"", dude clicking on username and reading all my posts - is just so plausible that I'm going in circles over it.

What would y'all do in this situation?"
ts_curious,asktransgender,"I feel frustrated that my bisexual, progressive, lgbt affirming wife is not being so supportive.... and I feel guilty feeling like this. Am I wrong to feel this way?","So, I am 39, MTF, married for 8 years,no kids, and I have over the last year come to accept that I am in fact trans, and that I identify as a woman. I have struggled with crossdressing since I was 6, and have always tried to repress these feelings out of quilt, believing that it was wrong in the eyes of God (grew up in a christian home), and that always felt that I didn't fit into the box because I liked women, and growing up in the 80' and 90's that meant that I was just a crossdresser (or so I thought).

My wife is very progressive in her views, a supporter of the lgbt community, and open about her bisexuality. She new that I used to crossdress, but thought that it was something of the past. She also feared at times that I might be gay because of it, due to the fact that she often mixed drag queens together with crossdressers. I have explained to her that its not the same thing.

About a year ago my repressed thoughts finally came to the surface, and I went trough a rough period for about 2 weeks were I lost around 5 kg. I accidentally came out to her one night, and she panicked, thinking that I would be gay and that she would loose me. Seeing her reaction I repressed it again, and said that it was probably my crossdressing feelings that were acting up due to stress.... a few months later I started seeing a therapist, and unlocking the repressed thoughts and feelings were a rollercoaster. I finally accepted myself late last year, and told my wife that I was on the transgender spectrum earlier this year. She took it hard again.

Now, since then she has told me that I need to find out what I want, and that should I choose to pursue transitioning then the marriage is over. I told her that I don't experience a lot of dysphoria at the moment, but that could change, and that I would need more of her support. She has had her own battle with depression and anxiety over the last few years, and she has depended on me for a lot of things. I am not sure if she is able to be there more for me, and I am wondering what the future holds for us. Currently where I feel most dysphoric is when were are having sex, and she is wondering what the future holds for us.... because she says she likes the d and not the v. I feel guilty for feeling like this, and it just adds on all the other guilt and transphobia I have internalised over the years.

She is ok with me crossdressing now and then, and even maybe being genderqueer, but not with me living as a woman, and so I feel a bit frustrated that my progressive wife who would have supported anyone else being transgender is struggling with me not being the man she married. She has said many times that even though she is bisexual, she prefers men....

And so when I read stories of other partnes that were not bisexual staying with the so's I feel hurt that my wife is not the same, and that our life hangs in the balance of whether I feel that I need to transition or not....

Sorry for the rambling, just needed to let out some steam... just feel lost at what I should do, and though I feel its wrong to say, I feel that it is unfair with the pressure that is put on me to sort this out. Am I wrong feeling this way"
Girlcadet,asktransgender,What do i do?,"First of all, thank you all for reading, and i know i cant just give you some information and ask"" Am i trans?"" it doesnt work that way.

im just so divided in my thinking.
Ive been interested in looking like a girl since as early as kindergarten, so basically all my life.
as a kid i was really shy and introverted, to the point of having only 2 friends.
the thought of crossdressing, and looking like a girl never left my mind. Until puberty finished.
i was freed for around 2 years,but its back now.
i would be fine if it was just the urge to wear womens clothing, but its something more.Looking like one.
this thought occurs in the fashion of a sinus curve.Im happy, then i think of this=&gt; get unhappy and it goes back and forth.
im sorry for ranting about all this, but im at my wits end x_x

last but not least, i hope this is the right place to post this :x

theUnmutual6,asktransgender,Accidentally got introduced at a new club by old name,"Haven't changed my name on my Meetup profile yet, and my friendly new friends took the initiative on introducing me. I was swept up in the situation, as you do. But it bothered me all night.

Well, it can't be undone. I do not in any sense pass; maybe had i got in there first, people could have bought it as parents giving their child a silly art name. 

Is there a way to correct my name next week? Would you do it? Any ideas for making this a fun, frothy, non-stressful situation? 

Ideally, I just want to have people use my name and have whatever views they like so long as they keep it to themselves. Im not ready to talk trans with a room of people I've just met. Is that naive? Can I get away with this? My name isn't a neutral one, it's a very definite change in gender name.

Edit for more context: I am Mff, so - there's a bit more leeway for me to be seen as an ""eccentric artist girl"" than there would be were I going in the other direction; and it's a Pagan club, so I feel like there's leeway to introduce it as my working name or a name I was Gifted By The Spirits or a name from my past life and totes get away with it (It will hardly be the most absurd claim I've heard someone make there)"
gackroo,asktransgender,How do the rest of you feel about a Cis woman playing a Trans woman?,"A little background: I'm an MTF trans girl who's a film student in college rn, and I have a concept for a film in one of my classes which stars a trans girl main character. Obviously, I want a trans girl to play her. I know several and if worse comes to worst I could play her, but at my college they want us to use people from the acting program in our films. I don't know if there are any trans women in the acting program, or even any genderqueer people comfortable with playing a trans femme. I have put my foot down as director that there is a 0% chance of a guy playing my main character, but if we can't find a trans girl to play her and I can't get any of my trans freinds to do it, I might be okay with a cis woman playing her. 
       What do all think of this? It's a bit of a weird situation I know, and trust me I want to have a trans girl play my main character more than anyone.

Sammantics,asktransgender,GCS with Dr Bowers or Dr Satterwhite?,"I'm trying to decide between Dr Bowers or Dr Satterwhite for GCS. I had originally written Dr Bowers off because her office gave me a surgery date in 2019, but now they feel confident they can fit me in this year since I'm local. Meanwhile, I have a firm date with Dr Satterwhite at the end of this year, and now need to decide between the two in order to start the process with my insurance.

Dr Bowers was my first choice because I heard a couple of years ago that she was one of the best. But once I started looking for alternatives, I discovered quite a few people happy with Dr Satterwhite, despite his recent practice. At the same time, I started hearing a few negatives about Bowers. So at this point, I'm not sure whom to choose  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

I've personally experienced the huge contrast in how their offices operate -- I've already had a consult with Dr Satterwhite and have been able to reach out to him directly with questions, while I haven't spoken at all with Dr Bowers, and find the office's focus on money (payments needed for application, consult) to be a tad off-putting. That said, bedside manner and approachability of a doctor is secondary to the results, and I'm having difficulty discerning between the two based off their websites.

Can anyone speak to their experiences with either doctor, or share why they might have chosen one over the other?"
norahnerd,asktransgender,Tria laser for Beard,"I've been transitioning for almost two years now... I've already had a year of laser on my face (last session was in July), and initially the results were very good. For example, I only had to shave my mustache area in the morning. However, by November I was having to shave my entire face every day and by now, I'm waking up with noticeable 5o'clock shadow. I did go to a salon that was recommended to me by my therapist, so they do have experience with MTF, and I am ""skin type 2"" so my hair is dark enough to theoretically be treated, but my beard is almost all back.

I don't feel like spending another $1,000 or so on more treatments when it just comes back later, and I was looking at the Tria laser.. Now, I wouldn't expect that to eliminate hair for good, but I was hoping I could use that to keep my beard at bay until I had time and money for electrolysis. Does anyone have experience with that? "
shatteredtruth,asktransgender,TIFU by coming out to a friend. What do now?,"TL;DR: Came out to a friend, it went well but now they're acting weird and passively confrontational. What do?

Okay so technically not today, and they are technically not *only* a friend, but this more or less happened.

At first they seemed supportive, keeping contact friendly and maintaining the pre-existing social plans we had established. But over time they have become increasingly distant, and a few weeks ago suddenly ceased the ongoing social plans we had previously established, with no notice and no explanation.

Since then they have started to act in ways that feel... passively antagonistic? Not openly, just generally more terse and seeming to deliberately not understand or deliberately misunderstand things I say in discussions we're both involved in.

Normally, if someone started acting like this towards me, I would confront the person about their behavior and ask them to discuss what is really wrong, more directly. This person is a colleague though,  seems to be otherwise avoiding me, and it's already uncomfortable enough without possibly instigating further conflict.

Has anyone else experienced this after coming out? How did you respond to it? What happened afterwards? Did you ever find out why they started acting that way?

Clarine87,asktransgender,"When they say ""but you're not like your &lt;desired gender&gt;"" flip the question around to ""prove that I am my &lt;assigned gender&gt;?""","I've made this point a number of times. Thought I'd make a thread just for this to see what others think - on the basis that it is easier for you to disprove a positive belief (that you are &lt;assigned gender&gt;) than it is to defend against and disprove a negative belief (that you are *not* &lt;desired gender&gt;). 

**TL;DR Ignore all the text and focus on the title.**

Often we face interrogation on the basis of our desired gender. This requires us to overcome a presumption, on the part of the questioning person, where what they believe to be true - a negative - that we're not &lt;something&gt; is correct. 

When you face this, flip the question around, thus asking ""if you don't think I am &lt;desired gender&gt;, prove that I am &lt;assigned gender&gt;?""

In terms of substantive reasoning the difference is minor, but in terms of winning the discourse on the spot it is significantly more balanced in your favor as now the onus of proving **your** (&lt;assigned&gt;) **gender** is now on the other party. Which is often a much easier task than proving your &lt;desired gender&gt;.

This won't work for everyone and I'm sure some of you will find it upsetting to switch from 'proving desired gender' to 'asking another to prove your assigned gender' - Let me know what you think, this little trick worked for my parents.

I concede this only works for person that have known you long enough to, when confronted with your transgender identity, think back through your historic behavior/conduct with a disregard for your biological gender to actually see conduct which is genderless when ignoring your physical and passive affirmations of your assigned gender.

For example my dad made a comment about my clothes being masculine and I countered with ""but you bought all my clothes until I was 21"". That is much more surmountable than proving ""why I don't dress like a girl"".

Trust me this reversal can work in your favour.

EDIT:

I didn't realise how long this had got, added tldr - sorry!"

desirefor-eternity,asktransgender,"I'm a Man, but i want to be beautiful and pretty?","(I'm not sure if this in the right /r,  apologies if it isn't i wasn't sure where to put it!)

I'm an 18 year old male who struggles hugely with his image. I would consider myself ugly, a 4/10, nothing even slightly remarkable.
Yet I have an obsession with vanity, I've always wanted to be beautiful not handsome, I wanted women to look at me and say wow he's beautiful (petty I know) I have no desire for debatably masculine traits which I posses some of like; a wider and longer nose and more angular longer face. I want to look pretty. To set an example of how I dreamed of looking would be Andreja Pejic. She is the ideal look I want.

I wear some women's clothes as they have such variation and art and colour to them as well as shape, I also wear jewellery, and am growing my hair long. I'm having really problems coming to terms with how I look and who I truly am, I don't feel like I look the way I should or am truly happy at all with my appearance in fact. I also love the delicate and feminine grace that i see in women. 

I feel so upset when I look in the mirror and at a photo and everything I represent is a polar opposite to image I want. I know I sound needy and pathetic, and at the moment I'm trying to achieve what I can through diet and exercise, but I'm starting to think it's pointless. Would surgery be an option? Would it be permanent?

My flaws as I see them at the moment would be: Nose too long and wide and just wrong shape, jaw is weak as well as wrong shape too, chin is weak, and possibly too long. I know appearance is down to winning the genetic lottery but I want to be happy with what I see in the mirror.

I'm not asking for pity or sympathy, I just want advice what should I do? What steps should I take? And does anyone else feel similar?

hayden2323,asktransgender,possibly MtF??,"So I've been questioning I guess for like at least a year or two. I feel like I've figured out a bit about myself but I'm really not sure how to proceed. I'm pretty confident in the fact that I wish I had been born a girl and grown up a girl and would now be a girl (well, woman I guess; I'm 21). But, obviously, I've grown up a boy and currently have quite a life built as a boy.

I really don't like my physical appearance at present, but I'm not sure how I'd feel about my appearance if I were a woman. I'm sort of realizing as I write this that I haven't thought about that much -- I just tried to picture myself looking in the mirror as a woman, and it's really strange/foreign.

More, the thing that makes me feel I'm a woman is personality -- I feel like I'm a very feminine person in the way I interact with people and the way I approach making new friends and the way I want to talk to friends. I feel like other women are ""like me"" and I want to be able to befriend them as a woman if that makes sense???

Okay I'm really struggling to figure out what I want to say/ask. I guess I just want a sense of what sorts of people are out there?? Are there other people who are trans moreso as a result of personality than physical appearance? Are they out to friends/family; are they going through transition/HRT?

 As for facial hair, I have  sparse, but definitely there growth on my upper lip - definitely not enough to make a decent stash, but if I let it grow it would be noticeable and people would make fun of my weak attempt. There's also a few hairs on my chin and some in my sideburn area. These ones are far softer than those on my upper lip, sort of midway between vellus and terminal. My hair is this shade of brown.

Would I be better off with laser or electrolysis? Would laser work on my finer hair? 

Part of me thinks I would be better off trying laser, because I believe its cheaper and far less painful. Is this correct?

throwaway020917,asktransgender,"I came out to my wife this week, but it's not going well. Now what?","So for a little background, I'm 35 and been with my wife (dating / married) for about 7 years now. I've dealt with a lot of the feelings of gender confusion that many here have since I was young. I've found that they are constant, but have definitely ebbed and flowed over the years. Anyway, about two months ago, those feelings returned stronger than ever. 

Thanks to embarrassment, denial, repression, whatever, I just couldn't bring myself to ever tell her. I know, it was a dumb shit thing to do, but it is what it is. I'd been hardly sleeping for the last few weeks thinking about it, and I decided it was time to seek therapy. I don't know what exactly I want, but I need to talk things out. Well, I knew if I told her I was going to therapy, she'd want to know why, so a few nights ago, I told her everything. How I always wanted to be one of the girls, always hated men's clothing, always had (and have) an unbelievably low self image, etc. Lots of tears, but also a wave of relief for me finally verbalizing it.

Initially, she was shocked, but expressed her support and love for me. But in the days following, it hasn't been as good. Things I've heard:

""You can do whatever you want with your money and body, but I don't want to see it. Seeing you in a dress would kill my sex drive for you permanently. I can barely get over thinking about it.""

""Maybe it's hormonal. Maybe you are low on testosterone and that would fix you.""

""I'd better call for appointments to go to the dentist, gyno and so on before you leave me to be a woman and I don't have insurance any more.""

""You should really see a general therapist first. I really don't think transitioning, if you go that way, is going to make you happy.""

""If you've felt this way as long as you say you have, then you should have told me before. I feel angry and lied to."" (This I agree with, unfortunately.)

When I told her I booked a therapy session, she demanded to know who, so I told her (a not-so-local gender therapist). She immediately Googled it, saw he had experience with LGBT issues and pretty much assumed that I was going there to ""start the process.""

I reiterated that I just want to talk to someone to figure out my emotions. But I'm feeling pretty down about this. I'm not happy, and I can't stay how I've been, but I feel like I'm being forced to choose between keeping my marriage and exploring something that might truly make me happy. She says she loves and supports me, then follows it with something like above. The tension has been thick as fog the last few days around my house. Does it get better?"

palefabulous,asktransgender,Question about Therapy &amp; Commitment,"I'm MtF, but I don't think it really matters.

I'm a few therapy sessions into getting my letter for HRT, and my therapist has  hinted at the doctor requiring a ""level of commitment."" She had brought up living as a woman, and that the doctor(they are both part of the same facility, so they know each other) would like that?

I have some questions about that, if you could help. 

First, what does it mean to 'live your preferred gender'? I asked my fiancee and she found it to be a pretty sexist statement.

Second, my given name is unisex and I actually _really_ like it. I also do not experience genital dysphoria, and I like to dress in skinny jeans and big black boots. I feel like all of that together may be ""manly""? I showed up in all women's clothing at the last therapy session, but it would be hard to notice due to the style. Do these things negatively impact my chances of moving forward?

I'm just a bit anxious, because I've waited so long to do this and I don't want to screw it up and make it take even longer than i needs to.

4amgardevoir,asktransgender,weird place (is this normal/how do i slow down?),"the first time i've consciously said to myself ""i don't think i'm male"" was about a month and a half ago. in retrospect it's been a steady culmination up to that point, but at the time it felt like it felt like it came out of nowhere and knocked the wind out of me. 

i spent the next two or so weeks in a death spiral of self-loathing, imposter syndrome, hours upon hours of frantic googling, sleep deprivation. 

assisted by the stories and questions of others i was able to get back to a place of relative normalcy, opened up to a few friends, bought my first [female clothes](http://imgur.com/a/lgyNV), and felt good about how i looked for the [first time.](http://imgur.com/a/lUyBJ)

ive had some of the happiest moments of my life that i can remember in these last weeks, just standing in the mirror in my kind-of-shitty lady clothes and smiling like a dork. its so simple but it feels like so much. im going to try and start learning how to use makeup this weekend and maybe buy try to buy a cheap skirt and MAYBE tell my cool new marxist friends about some of this and im very excited

but at the same time i feel like im being torn apart in 80 directions at once. i feel like things are moving very quickly but i want them to move so much faster, i want to be on hrt yesterday and to start transitioning last week. i want to  but then some moments it'll all feel made up again and i'll start panicking and be so sure that i've just invented all of this to feel special. and then that'll quickly pass and i'll start thinking about how stupid i was not to figure this out earlier ([how did anyone think i was male jesus christ] (http://imgur.com/a/TJQn2)) and i'll just get absolutely despondent about all the time i've wasted not being myself. and then i'll get the sudden urge to tell everyone i've ever known i'm trans even though i'm still so unsure myself (ive told 4 people). and then i'll buy more clothes i can sorta afford but definitely won't wear in public. everything is so exhilarating and uncertain and terrifying.

is this normal? am i rushing things? how do i slow down if i am? if not can i go faster? what do i do?"
NarrowHipsAreSexy,asktransgender,What happens if you try to delay puberty indefinitely? What are healthy hormone levels and why?,"I've asked this question a variety of times and in a variety of ways, but to be honest, I've never really gotten much of an answer yet.

To be honest, I relate strongly to a lot of the non-binary people I have talked to, despite now identifying as a tranwoman, such as the fact I never wanted to undergo puberty, and I'm not sure actually undergoing female puberty would have made me any happier. Sometimes I've had doubts about going from identifying as non-binary to identifying as a transwoman due to the fact I always hated puberty doing what it did to my body, and never wanted a binary puberty or secondary sex characteristics. I really relate to non-binary people I have read and talked to saying similar things.

But that's an off-topic story for another day.

In any case, I feel very ignorant of these matters. I am certainly no endocrinologist. But from what talking about this subject has led me to believe, if that you can't just delay puberty indefinitely, and you have to eventually choose a binary puberty eventually?

Also, despite being an educated adult, this subject, that is, puberty blockers and hormone levels, and talk of going through a ""second puberty"", makes me wonder and question if I ever actually understood what puberty is to begin with, despite having sex ed and biology courses. Nothing about my understanding of human biology requires puberty, or for an adult to have different hormone levels for child, or very androgynous hormone levels, for that matter.

But again, I am very ignorant, I am not an endocrinologist. I really hope that biological reality isn't that you are forced into a binary puberty and have to accept secondary sex characteristics as an inevitability. But I don't know the truth and I guess I should face the truth and learn scientific reality, thoroughly and completely about this subject, I can't so much as work with something I don't understand. And I can't move forward if I just dig my head in the sand because I'm afraid of a reality that makes me uncomfortable.

But now that I'm asking the question, nobody seems to be answering. I asked the question on a transgender sub, I don't remember if it was this one. And I appreciate the upvoteds I got. Unfortunately, I never really got an answer, though. I asked on /r/AskBiology, and I got no response, or votes, or anything. I asked the question on /r/NoStupidQuestions, and I got a rollercoaster of upvotes and downvotes, and no answers. This question and my lack of knowledge makes me feel really ignorant and uneducated, so I thought it would be appropriate to ask there, but apparently not. I've spent hours googling this question in different ways, trying to find what I'm looking for.

But no matter how I word the Google search, ""can you delay puberty indefinitely"", ""what are safe hormone levels"", ""indefinite puberty blockers"", ""never undergoing puberty"", ""safe adult hormone levels"", ""safe hormone levels"", ""adult hormone levels"", ""non-binary puberty"", ""child hormone levels"", ""prepubescent hormone levels""(gosh does that ever feel creepy to type out, yes I am self-aware about that), and many others trying to find the key to the puzzle, that is, finding the results I'm looking for. The right words for the right results.

But still I never seem to come across a search engine link that really educates me on what I'm looking for. You can try those search inquiries and maybe you'll find something more informative, but I don't.

And honestly, I'm just frustrated. I don't understand how hormones work. Particularly in relation to avoiding some of the effects of puberty, such as secondary sex characteristics or remaining androgynous. 

For non-binary people, for people like me who are probably binary but who regret puberty and what it did to their body. Heck, I've been reading some things about autistic people being uncomfortable with the effects of what puberty is doing to their bodies. People who are sympathetic towards what neuro-atypical people are going through, and TERFs who think that autistic people shouldn't be able or allowed to do anything about that discomfort. 

I want to fully understand what any of us can truly do in response to this. And that means understand what puberty truly is, what effects of puberty may or may not be necessary, and what is the difference between healthy and not healthy hormone levels.

I'm afraid I cannot say much on this matter. Whether I want to argue with an alt-righter or TERF, or just giving advice to someone who is feeling dysphoria. **I don't know what I am talking about.** Not in any real depth, anyway. And that ignorance is frustrating. I feel too ignorant to even have a proper opinion, or how to move forward.

So can any of you out there who is knowledgeable or has links to in depth sites that will educate me on this matter please help? I'm embarrassed to ask this question, but I'm really tired of not knowing, and it's actually causing me a lot of anxiety."

PuzzlePrism,asktransgender,I'm super lost and confused regarding SRS. Help?,"So it's basically just as the name implies. I mentioned to my therapist that I would love to have SRS the summer after my freshman year of college, and through a series of scholarships my dad's job helping with my tuition, insurance, and other payments I can basically use part of what was my college fund for SRS. I'm incredibly lucky and fortunate for such an opportunity, I realize, but I'm kind of 100% lost.

Where do I find SRS doctors? Is there a list somewhere? I checked this subreddit and WPATH and while I recognize some names like Supron I really wanna carefully weigh my options and not choose based on name recognition alone. Also, is there any good sites for seeing before/after shots of SRS? I realize that results will vary wildly but it would feel reassuring to just see results y'know. Oh, and finally, how do I weed out the good surgeons from the bad? If I were to google their names would I find negative reviews?

The other trans women I know only stick by me because we're in the same boat, not out of love. I'm far uglier, less intelligent, meaner, more abrasive and I disgrace the entire community just by existing.

Whenever I think about cis people, I think that I was a failure of a man so I tried to be a woman and obviously that was doomed to fail. I can never have a life like a cis woman, so why even bother trying? I think about trans people and i realize I'm everything that the trans community hates. I hate the fact that I love women, it's insulting to them and it's a disgrace to the word ""lesbian"" for me to call myself that. And God help the woman who falls in love with me, if that's even possible.

I'm among the most privileged people in the trans community: I'm white, I'm MtF, I have a lot of ""friends"", a ""supportive"" family, I'm not impoverished or physically disabled, and I'm throwing all of that away.

I'm going to be taken to a mental hospital tomorrow but I'm not going to make it that long. I have a plan and I'm going to try to go through with it.

For some back story I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and adhd for as long as I can remember. Then this new trans thing came up and made everything even worse. I finally got past the worst part and the ride back down the hill to happiness has been a hell of a fun one. I realized I'm an extrovert, I have more friends that I've had in years, I talk with my co workers all the time, I have a boyfriend who's pretty damn cute, and I am finally being myself :D Part of that process was coming out at work so I'll share that story with you all in hopes that someone can relate or be encouraged to keep going because it DOES get better.

Because of how impactful being myself has been for my life I got a tattoo to symbolize that which is linked at the bottom of my post. Let me know what you think, and insert the transgender people being in IT meme shortly after :P

Coming out

Hi everyone! I have an announcement and a story, with the story being first. Feel free to skip the story if you don't enjoy beautiful tales of wonder. 

Imagine how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. You get to see this process in front of your eyes and this same creature with the same thoughts and same life all of a sudden has a different name that you have to remember to call it by and it even looks different! That's just so crazy! We as humans don't have some wonderful cocoon we can jump into and be changed when we come out. However there are transgender people who need to change genders in order to feel normal. We have to change what name we use for this person who we know much better than the caterpillar and this person has to transition out in front of people without hiding inside a cocoon. Because of this challenges can arise throughout this process that are very different than a simple caterpillar has to endure. If anyone has questions about these challenges, metamorphosis, or anything else related to my story feel free to email myself or Laurie in HR as we are both happy to explain! 

Now for the announcement: 

I'm transgender and will be going by the name Allison and using she/her pronouns. If you wanted to you could call me Allie as well buts it's really up to you. I'm still the same person, I'm still pretty awesome, and I would still love to fix your computers when they break. I'll be out of the office today(Friday) but will be back on Monday going by my new name and pronouns. In case you didn't read my heart touching story feel free to ask any questions you have to myself or Laurie in HR. We're happy to answer. Thanks everyone for reading, have a wonderful Friday and weekend!

weirddysphoriashit,asktransgender,My dysphoria is being very weird recently,"I am not too sure weather what I have is gender dysphoria or maybe something similar that's making me feel this way, like I have something wrong with me. Or maybe I am so paranoid about having gender dysphoria, everything I feel I think is dysphoric but in reality it's normal and I am just extremely impressionable.





Around December time, I wish I were born AFAB so bad. But now, I don't care what I was born as. I used to get suicidal thoughts over it, I'm not even too sure if I want to be AFAB or AMAB now.





I constantly think about wanting HRT, I think about how much I want it, I get really depressed about not being able to get it, but I completely forget what it for. Then I think about it, and then I think is it worth it? 




When I'm less dysphoric, I want the dysphoric feelings to come back. When I have them, I feel suicidal. I have the thoughts they make me depressed, but they also make it clearer on who I want to be. In someways I feel worse when I am confused, as I have no idea on who I want to be (like right now).


Maybe I'm gender fluid, I don't know. Although these feelings can change almost instantly. Like a couple of weeks ago I was feeling suicidal, then I got a phone call from someone, then the thoughts instantly went and I forgot about it. When I wake up I completely forget about being trans until I get reminded about it (often the thought comes into my head).



Today I picked my phone up to call my GP surgery to get an appointment for a referral to a GIC. Then when I was about to dial the number, I stopped and thought to myself ""is it really worth it? Do I actually need this?"".




What the hell should I do (apart from see a therapist)? Like questions that one could ask themselves to see who I am?

hellomynameis99,asktransgender,I am in a bad situation... please help...,"So I'll first breakdown my backstory.

I am a 19 year old, currently attending College in the state of Washington. About a month ago, I had to stop taking HRT pills (mtf) because I came out to my parents and they threatened me that if I continue down being trans, I will be kicked out of the house with only 50 dollars to give me and all my clothes (no electronics/communication) and spill the beans about my transition to everyone. So I told them that I will stop with all this trans stuff because what could I do with just 50 bucks? Also I do love my family a lot. 

About a few day later, they made me promise not to think of any transgender topics again. My parents deleted all my contacts (i.e. reddit, phone numbers (I made a new reddit account to share this)) that had to do with my transgender identity. They are also super religious so they made sure to let me know that I will go to hell if I was trans. 

So that brings me to the present. All the drama has seemed to pass, everything seems to be normal, but my parents (specifically my mom) has been more religious than ever (not that it is a bad thing (I am also christian if it is something yall should know)). Also of course I still have my trans issue in the back of my mind but even more scared now to ever bring it up to my parents. 

Has anybody experienced this something similar before? What did you do in this situation?. I at least plan on just finishing my degree and get a decent job so that I am able to support myself financially (although transitioning a bit earlier would have been nicer). But breaking my parents heart again is something they don't deserve to the point I want to just runaway for the reasons they don't think. 

Sorry for my ranting. This is right now the only source I have to communicate with me being anonymous.

Edit:
Sorry I didn't add this

So initially I ran away from my parents and moved down to LA with 850 bucks. I was looking for a job (I got offered one at a restaurant), slept in a youth hostel, ate cup noodles etc. it was going good then my mom sent me an email, saying that they support me and want me to come back. I was excited but I specifically said for only mom to be there. she agreed. So I spent all the money I had left to go back to Seattle. Instead of my mom being there, my sister and dad came to. They then tried to talk me out of transitioning but I resisted. So then came a breaking point where I had to choose a life out of my family, no communication devices, identification card, health insurance etc. with just 50 bucks and some clothes. Or a supportive family but no trans related activity and communication."
saiberpink,asktransgender,MTF SRS surgeons that do repairs / fixes?,"Hi,

I had a surgery, but I am very unhappy with the result. It's obvious that it won't get better with more waiting, so I'd need to have it fixed somehow and I am searching for my options. 

Are there any good surgeons that do repairs of other's (previously failed) work? I am from europe, but if I can get a good result I will travel anywhere. (preferably not USA)

my biggest issues are:

- my depth is low and I would like it to go deeper

- the vaginal entrance is too high and results in all wrong insertion angle

- the outsides are all wrinkled / wrong shaped / no minor labia / blocking my urinary canal / simply awful (I believe this could be fixed on many places, but I'd prefer someone who could do the entire remake)

thanks in advance ;)"

samisjustmyname,asktransgender,The next two days will end with my first week on spiro?,"hello reddit, or at least this one, i joined yesterday and i'm pretty new to sites like these, I have finished discussing my dysphoria with my psychiatrist (14 months) &amp; I know this is something have to do I ever want to be truly happy in my life. In the past 2 months i've had my first meeting with my endo, a routine physical, blood tests, discussing blood tests' results &amp; talking to a nutritionist. 

I am relatively healthy in everything except vitamin D deficiency &amp; having a somewhat unhealthy liver (to a small extent). Since a kid I've had a small frame &amp; and ate like pig (i love food) &amp; never got fat even to this day which has made me conclude i have a high metabolism &amp; an ectomorph body type. The results weren't surprising as I knew my unhealthy eating was gonna show up but at least it was simply my liver &amp; not serious. My endo says she can inject estro into me if I choose to but due to my liver she wouldn't prescribe me pills/tablets. She also recommended that I shouldn't receive injections until I am fully healthy and the effects &amp; side effects can be monitored safely &amp; accurately. This saddened me and asked if anything could be done &amp; she said that I could in 2 months take new blood tests and get better results if I greatly changed my diet to which I said I would do. Meanwhile she prescribed me spiro for a month to see what effects will happen.

I know spiro is an anti-androgen and will block my testosterone and i've heard/read of people who started spiro &amp; estro at the same time or one before the other after a short or long period of time. My prescription is 50mg pills taken 1 twice daily. I think this will get increased in the nearing check-up that I have scheduled because I feel this isn't a large amount &amp; I know changes are slow &amp; gradual but I've noticed no changes in me.

I have a few questions, as I am turning 19 this year &amp; way past puberty but my psychiatrist says I can still have great changes to my body due to my young age &amp; I'm hopeful, very hopeful but my pessimism will get in the way but eventually I can just curb-stomp it. But my question is what medications should I take &amp; in which form? I wish to have the most changes to my body to reflect the sex I need to be &amp; yes I know at the most I can reach would be considered an intersex I am fine with since I can never be truly 100% female biologically. Does anyone know if taking spiro before estro hinder or help in transitioning? I should definitely ask for a higher spiro dosage next time because the side effects of sleepiness &amp; etc aren't hitting me as far as I can tell

Wow, i've written a bunch and still have so many questions but don't like how this post makes me appear self-centered with almost every sentence having an ""I"" but i've never been a good writer. Thanks for anyone that can help me with this &amp; hopefully I can help anyone else too (though I'm pretty uninformed on some things)"

I can't seem to figure out if this is me having low self esteem (I have like middle self esteem, I'm proud and loving of some parts of me at times but not on other parts), if it's just standard dysphoria as I don't see myself looking very feminine/like a girl (even though I passed a few nights ago in boymode) or if it's some kind of larger thing at play like dysmorphic disorder.

I feel like I'm unable to see myself in my own face most of the time, just seeing a weird figure that imitates my actions. I find it so impossible to see myself as a girl even though I pass a decent amount, get odd stares from people at times and my friend says I pass well (she's normally quite blunt about stuff so I trust her opinion). I was only able to see myself as a girl for about 2 seconds when I put some glasses on (I don't need them but I found them around my house). 

It's really distressing. I want to come out soon but I'm starting to feel like there's no point because I can't see myself as a girl. I can't afford FFS, I don't even know if it would make me feel better. Idk this is just a lot of venting because idk if my irl friends would get it.

MissUnderstoodOften,asktransgender,Anyone have a helpful analogy or useful phrase to help someone (family) understand that by claiming a transgender identity it does not mean that can diagnose me as having internalized misogyny and hatred for the feminine?,"I am currently identified as nonbinary &amp; genderfluid. I have tried dating women in my early 20's. I've been bisexual for 16 years. Everything inside me feels male. I even dream I am a male, with all the parts, and it even feels vastly different in my dreams when I have sex as a male than as a female. My family is traditional and doesn't want to believe I am male inside. They want to believe what their brains know and can handle. (It doesn't help that all of my long term relationships have been with men. They still think I'm straight!) They don't know what it feels like to have lived with body dysmorphia, suicidal tendencies and severe depression all of my life. They can't possibly understand the kind of relief I would get from a FTM transition. They google what they only see of my life from the outside, and try to diagnose me with everything under the sun. (Meanwhile my therapists are like, get away from your family, break away, they are holding you back.) I have worked so hard on trying to love them as they are, only to receive nothing but criticism and blame for who I am and for not having my life together by now (according their standards of living). I'm about to open up to all of them, and relocate to LA for my career. I could really use some help. As you can see, I am not efficient with my words - yet. This is a symptom of being in between lives - my old life and my new life. I don't imagine my taste in men (gay, bi, trans) will change. What can I possibly say to them to break their stereotypes of body transition? I don't want keep breaking my own heart, by being attracted to closeted gay men and bisexual men. I've turned a few, and I could cry thinking of it. I miss them. I miss love. And I want to present who I am on the inside on the outside too, so I don't keep giving cis men (and closeted men) the wrong impression. I can't go through another breakup. "

I know ""normal"" isn't really anything, everyone is different, but... I wish I didn't *suffer* from this. I want to be a woman so bad, but, I also just wish I never felt this and was happy as the ""big, strong, handsome young man"" that everyone sees. 

I could do *so much* more with my life if I was just fine with who I am. I could've done good things that lead me to a good college that lead to well paying career. Move out of the country. I'd have made long lasting relationships, met a girl, get married, have kids and live a healthy, happy life. 

I can't do **any** of that. All because my brain is wired all crappy, and there is no way to fix it, so I have to *embrace it.* 

I don't like the hypothetical question *""If you could magically turn into a cis woman right now, would you?""* I feel like right now, yeah, I'd probably say yes, but... *would I?* Or would I much rather just wish away the dysphoric feeling and envy and all that crap to be a ""normal"" guy? I'd say yes to that too. But there's no point in getting caught up on hypotheticals.

 No point. I do all the time, though. I get caught up on these thoughts of who I *could* be, if only one thing were different, but. I have a hard time accepting *who I am.*

I want to give up, though. Either way I go, I'll hate who I am and where I end up. There's nowhere for me to go that I'll be satisfied with. At least that's how I feel, right now. :/ "

I often feel when I am more dysphoric, yes I feel bad about being AMAB and not AFAB, but at the same time I feel more like a woman, which I really like, and I can think about being a woman and it makes me sort of happy.



When there I am very little/not dysphoric, all I can think about is how I am not dysphoric. I feel like I am making this whole thing up, that living is male is completely fine and I am just over reacting. I also feel like I'm not sure if I'd rather be male or female.



It gets to the point where I dislike going out because I know I feel like I am fine with being male, and it makes me feel less like a woman. I got to go to college tomorrow, but I dread to because it will make me have all this doubt.


If I had a few weeks off to myself I'd probably be very sure if I am trans or not (and most likely I'd probably discover I am trans)

testacc125,asktransgender,4 months into HRT -- constant second thoughts.,"Hi all. So I've been on HRT around four months. If I sit relaxed, there's very small little boobs that poke out. And seeing these changes, as well as thinking about things a lot, is making me want to consider stopping.

See, I wanted for years to transition. I came to college and now that I was on my own, I was able to go to an informed consent clinic and start HRT. It was a very quick process and felt like a mere formality, really. No real psychological check or anything-- I guess that's the benefit of informed consent...

I don't have a single male role model.(Apart from Eminem?) I don't idolize maleness, or identify with males. Everyone I identify with (albeit they're all like anime or videogame girls cause they're fucking adorable and I want a similar (realistic) aesthetic). I just WISH that I was able to be comfortable being a male, to save myself all of this trouble and stuff.

Often, especially when I get stoned, I just get this massive urge to quit while I'm ahead, take what transition has taught me so far, and move on. I don't like having my school days occupied by thoughts of fear, wondering if I'll change my mind entirely further down the line and have to live as a male with boobs.

HRT removes the dysphoria in a sense, so I no longer feel a burning urge to transition. I don't see anything wrong with maleness anymore-- I just would ideally have not been a male. But I wonder-- why can't I just accept it? I could be a punk male, and be cute, and that's that. I want to take the blue pill and forget about all this potentially life-ruining shit.

I tend to fill myself in in my fantasies with female characters like Mercy or D.va (yeah don't laugh!) because I love their aesthetics and their voices. Sometimes though I just imagine myself as a male in them because it's easier to and I understand the anatomy better. I really wish I had a soft, warm female voice that I would be so happy to shout out rather than my dumb bass male voice which I've always hated. 

I know I won't be some cute picturesque anime girl or anything. That doesn't really dissuade me. It feels like to be able to identify with them in the depth that I want to, I have to accept myself as female too. Like how boys I'm sure identify more with boy characters. It just feels more natural to me to identify with females. I see girls at my college with cute hair or some cute aesthetic and get really jealous and kind of idolize them.

All in all I just wanna take the blue pill and forget all this stuff. Looking back on how things were pre-HRT, honestly if I went back there knowing what I know, I'd still be able to take joy in hedonism and sexual stuff and smoke lots of weed. I could still exist. Only thing is... everything feels a bit more empty and devoid of feeling if I try to cut this part of my life out.

Here's some pics... I obviously don't pass yet, but if someone could also comment on them (I know I gotta fix the eyebrows!) like maybe what hairstyle to do? Usually it's just a ponytail. I feel like I look really unattractive and honestly I just wanna shave my head into a mohawk(love my ponytail though), get some piercings and say fuck transition at this point, even though it's made me so much more mentally clear, this constant anxiety is awful.

Also I still want to be able to use my dick and it has curved slightly to the left after starting HRT which is a little scary and there's that like darkened skin on the bottom that trans girls tend to get. Scary. HRT has unlocked some sexuality in me and I feel much more ""open"" than before in terms of sexual acts I wanna do. I'm worried that this will interfere with my sex life (staying on HRT that is) in the future. I wonder if my idolization of females isn't exactly wanting to be one, but finding them attractive instead? (I wonder why I could not just do both though.) I am attracted to females, definitely. It's kinda hard to imagine myself with boobs too. This is just weird.

fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,I don't even think transitioning is worth it anymore,"I keep having this forever ending questioning, whereas I keep thinking different things about everything, and it's just so complicated and it's messing me up so much.



This is how I go:

* Do I want to be a girl? Maybe
* Do I want to be a guy? No
* So you want to be a girl then? Er...... no idea
* Do I want to live the rest of my life as a man? No
* So I want to live the rest of your life as a woman? Meh, Thinking about it I don't really care what I am
* If I chose female, I will have to learn to do makeup, how to act more feminine, go on hormones, come out, Do I really want to have to go through that? No, being male is so much easier



When I'm in public, I hardly feel dysphoric, however I constantly have these thoughts in my head, I almost feel guilty for not wanting to be female. I almost feel like ""I'm trans, I should want to be like her, but I don't"".


At this point, I think I've been living as male (I'm AMAB) for 17.5 years, and only within the past 6 months or so I've started thinking like this. Before I used to think I'd rather be born female, but that was mainly because I cross dressed in private and if I were born female I could just wear female clothes in public and not look strange, plus the clothes would fit my body better as well.



Sometimes I feel really depressed and occasionally suicidal for being AMAB and not AFAB, but it's only when I am alone and not doing anything. I could just watch a movie and it will go away, but I just don't feel like it sometimes, as it can be quite nice to think about being female.



Why transition if being male is easier? All the effort, costs, and if me being male ain't broke don't fix it? "

hormone_throwaway,asktransgender,"Is it possible to grow female ""secondary sex characteristics"" (i.e. breasts) with estrogen only?","So as I understand it, testosterone stimulates the development of ""male secondary sex characteristics"": deep voice, body and facial hair, musculature.  Conversely, estrogen stimulates ""female secondary sex characteristics"": mainly, **breasts**.

When transitioning, MTF combine an anti-androgen to reduce their male characteristics, and estrogen to develop female characteristics.  Makes sense.

What if you took estrogen while maintaining a normal testosterone level?  Could you theoretically grow breasts, while keeping a masculine body?  Or does testosterone really *prevent* the development of any female characteristics?

I have heard claims both ways!  In this subreddit, most people claim that testosterone will render estrogen completely useless.  But [this reddit user claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/3ialuh/what_would_happen_if_i_put_estrogen_in_my_body/cufx9f3/) to have developed breasts while taking estrogen alone.  There's also the well-known phenomena in which steroid users or bodybuilders who inject massive amount of testosterone will grow breasts, due to aromatization of the excess T.

Has anyone ever tried 'supplementing' estrogen, instead of full-blown HRT?  Could it be used to grow breasts while staying male?"
ThrowingAwayFrom_Me,asktransgender,NHS Blood Test Results Question,"Hello!

Background: I'm on the GIC path but that can take up to 1½ years on NHS. I'm working with a private therapist/endo for hormones in the meantime.


The problem: my GP seems happy to do the blood tests but getting the results have been more difficult than I thought. I've had to ask for a second round of tests because everything I needed wasn't on the first set. (And it takes 2 weeks for results to come through each time)


Last time I called up and asked if I can have the results, the receptionist just said to come in and they can print it off. This time, I called and they said I had to get a doctor to talk to me about the results and they'll call me in the next day or 2. It's been a week now.


I guess I just feel a little overwhelmed since I've come so close to my first big goal and this should be the easiest step.


Has anyone else gone down the private/NHS mix path and has some advice? I can see this being a problem for future tests to monitor my levels too. (Also, so far they don't let me know the results have come back - I have to call 2-3 weeks after the test and ask for them)

My first name is Coby, but I may start going by my middle name after I change it. Some others I have considered are

* Stark (some people have pointed out that Coby Stark and Tony Stark sound a lot alike. I can't decide if this bothers me. I do love Tony Stark, but it might be better to have a name that is just mine and doesn't remind everybody of someone else.)

* Silas (probably won't use because I knew someone with this name so it would feel weird)

temp_acct_,asktransgender,Question for guys who have transitioned while on other mediaction (xpost r/ftm ),"Hi all

ive been given my prescritpion for t, starting out low dose to see how my body reacts etcetera. However got a couple of questions about effects, any feedback appreciated

Ive been prescribed 25mg day of the testogel (half a 50mg sachet) but am going to be starting out at half that dose (12.5mg) as I want to ease myself into it

This is also because I have depression/anxiety and am on medication for this (pristiq 50mg day), and was just wondering if any dudes out there had experiences transitioning while on SSRI/SNRIs? How does it affect your mood/energy etcetera?

For context im in my mid 20s and have been on this medication for about 3 years

My doctors advise was to start slow and come off it if the effects are too negative, which is my current plan. But I would like to know how other guys have gotten through, if there are any horror stories to be aware of etcetera

Am also wondering, even those who are not on SSRI/SNRIs, what has your experience been with getting an equal dose if prescribed less than a whole sachet per day? Were the dosages slightly different each day but even themselves out over the course of your transition, or did you manage to accurately measure each dose?

Thanks in advance"

worriesthrowaway,asktransgender,"HRT and other stuff in Ottawa is kind of a nightmare. I feel awful, isolated, and kinda suicidal. (vent)","sorry this is kind of really long and isn't a question, I just really need to vent somewhere. :s

so i just did my weekly shot a little bit ago, and the gnawing fear that i screwed it up (i inject in the thigh, my calves feel weird and half-swollen sometimes after and i think i might have missed the muscle but i don't have anyone to help or anything here or show me how and maybe i'm just dumb but youtube tutorials are really unhelpful) just built and built until i started bawling.

i feel so hopeless and isolated here.

i moved here from another country to be with someone who I thought loved me, but in person she turned out to be controlling and abusive and *scary*. I spent close to two years just trying to make it through the next day, and I'm still really messed up from it over a year later -- panic episodes, nightmares, flashbacks sometimes, ptsd. 

I don't have anyone here and i don't really have the means to move. The only people i know here are my abuser's family and friends.

i had a therapist i had been seeing for anxiety and ptsd from the abuse, but.....so she tried to hard sell me to switch doctors to someone at her CHC with 'it's the best you're going to get, as a trans person,' and then, after i agreed to it, went 'whoops just kidding the NP i asked to take you thought i was asking them to take any trans person at all as a patient, not asking them to take you specifically, and they already took someone so there's nothing they can do now that they know what i'm really asking lol.' And she didn't do a thing when i was applying for social assistance and needed something from her saying that my partner was abusive so that I wouldn't have to pursue her for support. (I got help from a legal clinic i asked for help with stuff related to the domestic abuse before, but even then it took me having a panicky breakdown at the caseworker's desk for them to care. I still get scared sometimes thinking of what would have happened if I just had my therapist to rely on.)

And I'm really skittish and conflict-averse, so i spent like four days worrying over a really meek and polite letter about how the whole thing made me feel unsupported and asking friends if it sounded aggressive or angry or anything before sending it, and at the beginning of the next session, she suddenly started talking about how ""we've been having problems for awhile"" and ""i'm glad i'm not the only one noticing it"" when the therapy had been really helpful to me right up until the time this stuff happened and the closest thing to a conflict we ever had was me very politely and haltingly saying the 'this is the best you'll get, as a trans woman' thing made me feel really uncomfortable. 

And....my last hormone doctor (who was kind of the only game in town, where I used to live) beat me over the head with the threat of stopping treatment because i ""seemed to have a lot of resentment for him and his clinic"" and made me not just apologize but *beg* for him to keep treating me because I very meekly and nervously said some things he said to me made me uncomfortable. I know how this kind of thing works. So I haven't gone in to see my therapist since.

I also see a hormone doc in a supposedly LGBT-friendly CHC who trained under a locally famousish endo. (he's retired now.) When we first saw her, she gave my partner at the time and switched me from injections to premarin and some kind of off-brand spiro. (I keep worrying that i sound crazy talking about it, but....the spiro I brought with me when I moved, I could take 200mg of that a day and be fine. This stuff, I took 400mg and it still wasn't enough.) My partner had slow feminization and blamed it on me, and I slowly lost feminization, but....no suggestions of alternate meds or dosages (other than very slowly raising premarin), no nothing. Very little help. I remember one time when our hormones ran out and it took us like a month for her to just sign and fax over a prescription renewal. 

And a few weeks before I got out on my own, I confided in my doctor about the abuse and she was really supportive and understanding! And I went out of my way to look for alternatives to premarin/spiro and asked for specific stuff and switching to estrace and cypro made things a lot better for about two months, but.....

But after I told her about the abuse, every time i tried coming to her with a hormone problem - my dosage feeling off, my blockers pretty obviously working less and less with pretty clear signs that t wasn't being suppressed - she suggested that it was in my head, or that if anything was wrong, it was caused by anxiety because i've ""been through a lot."" (And, I've been through horrible horrible things while transitioning. I know what 'this is just anxiety' feels like and I know what 'my hormones are messed up' feels like.) Things got even worse, and I got even more scared and desperate and suicidal, and.....for months, every time I tried telling her about what was going on, I'd get this flat look that just made me want to clam up and no help. :s

After several months of this, I told my dr. that I was taking a ton of spiro *and* cypro to little effect out of desperation and tried asking for Lupron, but that got vetoed outright. I got a referral to an endo my dr. works with, but she said they talked about me before the appointment, and I could tell, because instead of taking my symptoms seriously she just pushed a psychiatrist referral on me ""for anxiety."" I choked up and almost cried talking about my symptoms four different times in the appointment, she made a joke about how she can't do magic.

i used to like going out for walks a lot. now, my dysphoria is so bad that i can barely go outside, and when I do, I get clocked and misgendered or harassed much more. It's been like this for several months.

I saw my doctor again a few weeks ago. She said that she couldn't see anything wrong with me, not even when i went out of my way to point stuff out (like a ton of hair obviously having fallen out). And it makes me feel like I'm with my abusive ex again. I feel gaslit. I feel like nobody's going to believe me if I don't put it in terms like 'i went to a walk-in clinic out of desperation a week before and a doctor there who had never met me before could tell right off,' which just brings me back to when things got really bad and I was afraid no one would believe me if I just said 'my partner is doing these abusive things' instead of 'other people said these things my partner did were abusive.'

And I keep thinking back to something that happened with my dr. a few months after I started noticing the blockers weren't working the way they should.

me: ""I think my blockers aren't working as well, i'm not passing as well and I'm not feeling side effects but I'm also not feeling *any* effects since i got switched to a different brand""

dr.: ""well....when I first saw you in my office, I couldn't tell you were trans, and that's my *job*.""

me: ""but *now* I'm passing less and a lot more worried about my safety""

dr: ""well, passing isn't necessarily something to aspire to.""

i just.......i'm so *tired*. I'm tired of all this and I'm tired of living. And I feel like I'm totally on my own here. And I feel like....

I started transitioning back in 2009, and I was scared a lot, but hormonally at least I felt a lot better. And I felt like I could be myself. And I actually had hope for the future. And then I moved here, and I started seeing my dr. about 2.5-3 years ago, and things started getting worse and worse (and for awhile she was literally the only doctor i could see), and....i guess i'm scared that things aren't going to get any better, that I just get five good years and then things getting worse and worse and worse and a lot of hiding and wanting things to end until i finally break for good.

And it feels horrible that i survived an abusive marriage (and other stuff i'm not going to go into bc wow this is really long and rambly already) only for *this* stuff to drive me to the edge of suicide. :x

I'm really tired."

Serisael,asktransgender,How to obtain the 2.9K start payment for Suporn's SRS?,"This is a calm redo of my initial post

At my age in the Netherlands there clearly aren't a lot of methods for obtaining that kind of money within a short period of time. Either charity or to apply some background fund. Charity doesn't seem to be an option on my part considering that my mom lives on welfare and that my dad is the real life version of dagobert duck, only considerably less rich. I asked him nicely twice so far, the first time in which he straight up refused me along with a rather biggoted remark. The later of which, is still pending. Awaiting an answer.

I have considered some options. Not many, considering that at my age, 17, there simply aren't. That goes for the legal field atleast.

Restricted to 12 hour workweeks resulting in at the very best getting 2000 Euros. 40% of which I could only gain during april, where I to do the taxes for it. So, simply put, that would be a pointless endeavour considering the fact that at the age of 18 I can simply get a loan instead. Prepared to wait that time I am not, knowing how agonizing this type of waiting can be, I'd rather not. (Sidenote: In 10 months and 9 days I will be 18.

Considering the waiting time of 18 months and a recovery period of pretty much atleast 6 months. Thats already 2 years, having 10 months on top of that, all the while watching inflation wreck Suporn's SRS price, is simply put, more horrid. Being able to negate those 10 months of technically unnecessary waiting time, would make everything a whole lot better. And having that set date on when I will undergo the operation will give me so much more stability. Undergoing 10 more months of instability would leave an unnecessary scar.

As for my options, clearly legal work doesn't cut it. I can pray for my divorced dad to not be a cheapskate, but considering his trackrecord; (Which I will avoid going in-depth too) the chances are slim. This leaves me only in the realm of illegal work. CPA rekt my muscles, this kinda cancels out all the work that requires muscles. I could peer towards making a loan illegally, off the books. Considering the stigma surrounding that, I wouldn't be surprised nor happy if the interest rate on that was 400% so I think not. Aside from that there is a risky profession that I could potentially dip my toes into. But me thinks the risk outweighs the pros... I live in Amsterdam, so... prostitution? I understand that because of my assigned gender the pay there is even more horrible. But, still... I don't see many if any, other options. :/

My mom's side of the family is generally poor. My dad's isn't. I will definitely peer into that, but considering my relationship with them, I am quite positive that too would end in failure.

Anyway, at this point I have calmed down somewhat. I am trying to keep myself on edge. Trying to keep myself from crying that way.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. First month of HRT is almost over, my sex drive is creeping back. This makes the decision making process a little bit more skewed. Especially considering the fact that sex constantly creeps into my thoughts.... Anyway, now I am venting again. Any help is very appreciated"

He didn't  want to have the conversation over text so we arranged to talk today. So I get on the call and I bring it up and say that it is stressful for me to have this conversation and I felt weird bringing it up to him. This is our conversation from memory: 

Friend: I don't really care but you know how I feel about the weird shit

Me: weird shit?

Friend: yah like cutting off your balls, changing your voice, changing your body, or anything like that. As long as you don't do anything like that we are cool. If you do than I'm not going to associate with you.

So after this I just said ok, went silent for a little, said it was late, and got off. The thing is is that I am going to transition, I am going to change my voice, and I do want a vagina. So I guess I'm out a friend. The worst part is most of my friends are his friends so I'm out 3 friends. I guess I should feel bad but Im just glad I know and I can now cut him out of my life. I just felt the need to share.

I hate this and this sucks. I don't see how people can just be fine with not being trans and just stopping HRT because of it because I can't do that. My anxiety and depression are worse and anything transition related is causing anxiety. It's like I'm lying to myself because I don't want to admit I was wrong, but I also don't want to have to live as male I guess?

I'm 26. Wife. Son. We left the Mormon church last year, I quickly discovered I was bisexual . I've been crossdressing for a few years as a sexual fetish, but lately it feels more like the real me, not sexual all the time. I think I might be trans. 

I never wished to be a girl growing up. I didn't like many ""girly"" things. I didn't think I'd be happier if I was a girl. 

But I also wasn't necessarily happy as a boy. I grew up constantly being teased at my lack of masculinity, my disinterest in sports, my emotional sensitivity. I was the kid you could always make cry easier than you could get him to fight back.  I always just kinda felt like my masculinity was broken. 

But whatever, here I am, realizing that I'm happier now in these past few months of self exploration than I've ever been at any other point in my life. My horrible anxiety and depression have been kept largely at bay, I'm eating better, losing weight, finding myself attractive for the first time... All because I decided to see what would happen if i added a large dose of femininity to my life. 

And I'm 26. Watching my youth evaporate. Wife, who married a man and might not care for me as a woman. Son, who is going to have a hard enough time growing up with me as his daddy anyway, let alone as his second mommy. My whole extended family is still mormon. 

I wouldn't even know how to begin restructuring my life. I couldn't possibly imagine what and who I'd lose in the transition. And if it would cost me my marriage, that's not a deal I could take. Some part of me even feels like by posting this I'm being disrespectful to ""real"" trans people. I don't feel like I count. I'm just so fucking confused."

The other day we were talking eventually lead to him mentioning having posted in a subreddit. 

I checked the post out, but instead of doing the right thing and forgot I ever learned his username I got curious and checked his profile after work.

He had been posting here a few times, some months ago, talking about not feeling like he is fitting in a male rolle, questioning his gender and asking for advice on stuff.

Now I must clarify some things. 
We haven’t talked a whole lot about private stuff, it only happened a few months ago because his depression came up (can’t remember how that happened, but I was stunned to learn of it) I’ve been on and off depressed for about 7 years, and not ashamed nor afraid to tell people about my illness. So I mentioned me having gone through that whole thing and we kinda bonded through it.

When it comes to body type he’s a bit on the chubby side, with a nice thick beard (Think Jesse Cox, but a bit less chubby) 

The thing is, I kinda have a thing for this guy. He is cute, super smart, and somehow he manages to make me want to improve myself and be a better person. 

But now I’m stuck, unable to think of what to do or say to him. Being gay I feel like I should know these kinds of things, but I’m left feeling helpless. I kinda want us to be a thing, but I’m not sure if he is even interested in men, nor if he is transitioning. Any ideas on how I should move forward, or how to support him if he is transitioning?
(I know I should be using she/her, and I will do so if/when he asks me to)

Second: is it possible to get such surgery to be covered by insurance as perhaps part of treatment associated with transition? Third, is there a way I could get a feel for what size I would want?

Back then speaking to me about how I felt about the LGBT community and talking a lot about trans stuff, things that I didn't really care too much about back then.  We would hang out almost everyday and I even got her parents to really like me.  We would even sleep over at each others place quite often.  As far back as I remember she was always really small and feminine, to which she was picked on a lot for that back then, until I stepped in.  I mean I picked on her a little as well but she knew I was just messing with her.  She came out to me last year and I told her that I don't really care that she is trans.  We begun dating and so started the best relationship I ever had.

Anyways to continue with my real question, I am white and 6'3 and she is Asian and 5'1 and we have been together for a while now.

Throwaway11241997,asktransgender,Sex before transitioning,"So... I'm currently in this awkward ""maybe I am, maybe I'm not"" phase and I was wondering something. How many people had sex before transitioning? I have a very high sex drive, and while it's still there if I'm fooling around with someone I'm basically only focused on my partner. I have a desire to ""get off"" I suppose, but also a strong desire not to because of how uncomfortable I get with it.


In my last relationship there was a period (three or four months?) where I'd let them touch me, but only in a way that was as consistent with my preferred gender role as I could manage. It was never really satisfying, and while it improved from the period where it was deeply uncomfortable (to the point of tears), it never really got past mixed or negative feelings.


And sorry if this is awkward to read, but after that got too uncomfortable I'd just excuse myself to get off in the bathroom so I wouldn't really have to fight the need to give it just one more shot even though I knew I'd hate it.


So I'm wondering what other people's experiences have been? I know this is an uncomfortable question, but I'd like some help. I'm considering getting into another relationship and this has been on my mind."
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I had a traumatizing conversation with my dad last night, and I feel a bit disheartened because of it.","I had a conversation with my dad that didn't go well. The reason I started the conversation was to say how I'd been feeling much better, and it turned into a game of 24 questions and him getting upset at me.

""Why do you want to be a girl?""
""If you have a good life, why would being a girl make it any better?""
""You want to paint your nails? Cool your tool.""
""Whens the sex change? Does this really run that deep?""

Maybe he wasn't to the point I assumed he was at as far as it comes to accepting all of this. He wasn't being malicious and I know he had my best intentions in mind, and he's just having a hard time accepting this, and that's fine. And we're still going to see a mental health specialist and ""if it's proven that I'm trans"" he'd be find with things,

But I'm still upset, I was so happy. And for the entire day after my world came crashing down. I talked with my therapist and I feel better, and I'm starting to get back to my old Self-loving girl self, but I'm still kinda struggling.

Am I still allowed to be a girl? Am I still Olivia? Am I allowed to content with myself again?

These are all questions I keep asking myself, despite already knowing the answer. 

I refuse to have my happiness and contentness taken away from me. This is my life now, and I wouldn't have it any other way. And I'm not going back to his things were,

But right now, It's like after accepting myself I opened a door in my heart that took me to amazing and new wonderful place I always belonged. But a few stormy clouds popped up and I ran back into the door. And I'm having a hard time opening it again."

IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,How can I promote sexuality in my relationship?,"Prolly a bad title, but basically, I got a bit of a problem.

I don't mean I was forced or forced myself, it was all wanted and consensual, but I have a really big problem from my lack of libido.

For information, I'm taking cyproterone acetate, so that is definitively the cause, since I know I'm attracted to my boyfriend.

Until I see my endocrynologist on March 15th and try to get progesterone, how can I improve my sexual drive?

Jessica1978,asktransgender,Couple of questions about HRT that are really scaring me...,"Really hope someone can offer some advice here. I'm about to start HRT in the coming weeks. I believe it will be Evorel patches and finestride to begin with. I have two real concerns regarding starting treatment though and would be eternally grateful if anyone could offer some advice.

Firstly, I have an absolute phobia of vomiting. I read earlier that one possible side effect of taking estragen can be a morning sickness like nausea. This scares me so much, I'd almost not want to take the risk. Is this a common or even likely side effect?

Secondly, there is a bit of a history of breast cancer in my family. My mom's sister had it and my mother is about to start treatment for a cancer that was found in her breast (caught very early though and is already clear). How much extra of a risk will I be running in taking HRT with this family history? I have read several different takes on it. Some saying it increases the chance a LOT, some saying you're still below the percentage of getting it that a CIS woman is. Is there any generally agreed upon middle ground?

Thanks so much for taking the time to read and possibly answer these questions. I'm equal parts terrified and excited about starting HRT, but I really like to get as much information as I can first. And I know of no better place to ask and get an honest answer.

AlikiVougiouklaki,asktransgender,[MtF] How permanent is laser hair removal?,"I have fair skin and dark hair. I've heard that it's often pretty permanent in my situation, even if legally it can't be advertised as such. Many people have recommended doing laser before electrolysis. I want to try this, to possibly save money. 

Should laser and electrolysis follow in close succession, though? What if I get laser now—to hopefully clear out the most noticeable hair—and do electrolysis months later? If the hair regrows in those months, I feel like I'll have wasted the money I spent on laser. (I know it's YMMV.)

Hahaimtrulyinsanelol,asktransgender,Adderall and Gender Dysphoria?,"I've brought this up once before, and this may not even be the correct spot to ask, but I've noticed an odd correlation when it comes to GD and Adderall.

I've been on Adderall for ADHD for over two years. I do think I have ADHD but I also think it may have been a manifestation of my (at the time) hidden GD.

Some months are difficult, and I end up taking three pills in a day instead of two, so I sometimes run out at the end of the month.

I haven't gone more than 7 days without Adderall in a long time, but I've noticed my GD decreases in those 7 days. My reverse dysphoria regret grows.

Then I take another pill when I get new ones, and in a split second my mind really wants to be a woman again and my dyphoria returns.

My question is, since there seems to be no link between Adderall and GD (and my GD existed before I ever took it I'm sure), if my mood and urge to be female increases on Adderall because my mind is now chemically dependent on it and if I stopped long enough for my brain to return to a pre-Adderall stage if my mind would stabilize.

It's hard to ask this question, but when I take the Adderall my mood gets better, I feel more normal, and my gender identity shifts back to female. So that's because that's my normal self due to my brain now expecting Adderall, and if I went 2 months without Adderall I would feel the same.

I'm weening myself off it because I don't think I need it since I believe my ADHD was created due to anxiety, but when I don't take it I feel regretful about becoming female, and I feel a little reverse dyphoric if that makes sense.

Sorry for the convoluted question, but this is an issue that has been bothering me...

Thanks a lot!"

Here I am. And this action of stopping is not the problem. It is just easy. The problem is in those:

 * Why has my gender suddenly changed? I thought I was a girl 90%-100%. Now 15-25%. Does it mean the gender identity is **fluid** or something? Or was it just a phase? Or maybe I'm silly? :(

 * I don't want to receive all those masculine things in my body. I just want to be without any sexual characteristics. Without hair and brow ridges, also without a breast. So I **can't continue** HRT and also **can't stop** it.

 * During these 6 days I was **extremely tired**. If I continue my HRT, I will suffer from it again. I just want to sleep an incredible amount of time. Also I feel some depression like thoughts but maybe it is not because of HRT. Why?  

So, I hope you see my point. I can't get a gender therapist because I'm 16 years old person living in Russia in a very homophobic family. Also I keep DIY hormone replacement therapy."

&amp;nbsp;  
So first off, I met with a therapist this week!  It went super well I think.

I mean we basically spent an hour going over the questionnaire they had me fill out, and she asked me a few questions here and there, about my anxiety and other things I listed, as well as my gender confusion.

It was interesting talking about my childhood crossdressing memories and stuff with a real person.  I don't think I've ever had an out loud conversation about it, and it was really hard to put words together for it since it's been in my head for over 10 years.

I have another appointment next week to keep going, and I'm really looking forward to getting my thoughts out of my head at the very least.

I also felt pretty drawn to continuing to explore and connect to my feminine side and bought some more undergarments and my first pair of heels.  Depending on how that goes I may buy my first girl outfit.

I thought I'd share this letter in case it helps others in the same scenario.

Father,

We are not good at communicating. I know this, you know this, and we passive-aggressively drop hints about this in what brief conversation we have on the phone. Yet what I find strange is that neither of us, for whatever reason, has actually done something to fix this. Would it be wrong of me to say that even knowing what we know of each other, we both take this a little personally? I could be better about it, but I shouldn't have to be because you're my dad and you should want to talk to me-- at least that's what I'm saying in my head. You probably feel a bit similarly in my direction-- I'm your daughter and I should want to and try to talk to you more. 

However, there is something that we both have greatly in common: when given the time to breathe and consider our words, we are the most articulate in our family and I will fight anyone who tries to say otherwise. All of my good writing skills must come from somewhere, and I would be loathe to allow anyone to take credit for them but you. In terms of mythology, Athena was not born but manifested straight from Zeus's brain. It is not necessary to state who is who in this metaphor. You are the Greatest storyteller I have heard in my life. That may not be saying much because I'm young yet, but no comedian has ever made me laugh and no preacher has ever held my attention quite like you. Linguistically speaking you are the James Bond of my conscience-- regardless of what situation I find myself in, you are there in the back of my mind with a Dad-ism to explain or reflect. Choices and Consequences, The Haves and the Havenots, The Human Race, The Skills We Buy, Welcome to Adulthood-- your most famous speeches that only your wife and the children you've produced get to hear.

What I'm getting at here is I know you check your email everyday. The phone is difficult and in person is nigh impossible, but email... Where we would have time to breathe and consider carefully... This is it for us, dad. I thought about writing you a good old fashioned letter about this, but with something this important I don't want to risk it getting lost in the void. Letters may still happen but for efficiency's sake and ease of access, let's start smaller. 

The purpose of this particular message is to try to explain myself in a way that you may understand. I will not bore you with unnecessary and uninteresting details, I'll skip the medical jargon, I'll spare you from the particularly gory. 

Dungeons and Dragons.

One of the most difficult concepts to grasp (for me, anyway) is alignment and subsequently, alignment change. I've asked you what can cause that. Seeing as the alignment is basically your character's very essence and what they are built on, how they live their lives, express themselves, develop relationships. Their basest psychology. It's how you birth them and make them real to you, and how you understand them. It isn't as simple as good versus evil. A character is deigned based on a scale of good to neutral to evil, of lawful to true to chaotic. A combination of words from the two categories which over simplifies something that in reality is far more complicated... Gender works much the same way. In the world we recognize good and evil, but pay little attention to what's in between or falls in the cracks. We also recognize male and female, but in reality those two categories spiral off into approximately 63 different directions. 

Moving back to territory you understand, now:

In order to essentially ""rewrite"" your character, to make them new and reborn, a change in alignment must occur. This could be a traumatic event, a spiritual epiphany, the work of extreme magic, and very rarely, the energy from a weapon or object. You haven't told me many stories of alignment change because it ought not be considered. A Dungeon Master, regardless of the fact that they hail control over the dominion of your imagination, would never mercilessly inflict or otherwise enforce an alignment change on a character. Why? Because of roleplay suicide-- the reaction from having a player's identity stripped of them would likely cause them to stop and give up on the game. They would feel so betrayed that they likely would never play again, unless it is undone. It's unfair. In many cases, it simply isn't right.

I assure you that I am humble when I tell you that I have gone through not one, but two alliance changes. The first alliance change happened when I was still little, in elementary school. Up until that point I'd been living as what I felt was a boy, but just wearing different clothes from them. At home, I was [deadname]. In school, at lunch and recess, around my friends, I was Leo. Did you know that even that young, those kids could tell that there was something somewhat off about me? I shit you not, when I sat down on my first day in Ms. Voelz's kindergarten class, Jason Sheingold, Brianna Apple, and Ramah Pathak had a discussion and then told me that I didn't really... seem like a [deadname]. I asked what they meant and they said they didn't know. But Jason named me Leo and much to Ms. Voelz's wholehearted disapproval, that's what everyone started calling me. I could have told anyone about this but I wasn't entirely oblivious. If Ms. Voelz, a teacher of children who ought not hold any bias, reacted that way then how would another adult? I learned by example and she was the most fierce example I had to base my actions off of. Sure, Ms. Shoemake the Kentucky kindergarten teacher was the racist from hell, but Ms. Voelz was far worse. It was the difference between Lord Voldemort and Dolores Umbridge.

At recess when we played pretend I was always the Prince, the Hero, or the Villain. Playing the bad guy was my favorite, for some reason. But never was I a girl. Mulan was very present in my repertoire, though I never could understand why she decided to stop being Ping, or why she returned to her prior life. When I watched Disney Princess movies, I kept a keen eye on the Princes, and the men these ladies would fall for. Don't be mistaken. Even at that age I knew boys were my primary interest-- I just had a very extreme need to be desired, and so I think I studied these movies to learn from them. In the winter time I would help the little ladies after class into their teeny jackets. I would lend them my scarf at recess, help them on the stairs on the playground. I had very good manners, and I learned them from you.
	
The kids in class... It didn't matter what clothes I or Grandma put on my body. It didn't matter how it was intended to be translated, my peers saw recognized that I was a boy. ""Leo"" didn't stick after kindergarten, but until around second grade or so the difference in treatment I received from the girls and boys compared to other girls in class was too obvious to ignore. 

The people at Faith Presbyterian noticed it, too, I think. All the moms would dote on me after service. I distinctly remember hearing the phrase, ""She really needs a feminine influence"". I remember because I didn't like not understanding what that meant, especially because it was about me. I remember Grandma tucking me behind her legs and telling those mothers that that really wasn't their business. 

It didn't stop just about any female friend you had or we met from trying to mother me for some reason. I didn't think I needed it, I was perfectly happy with you, [eldest brother], and Grandma. I didn't know it was abnormal to be missing a female of that title in a household. 

Anyway. Things are very fuzzy from about third grade to sixth grade, but somewhere along the way Leo was put to sleep. Like Sleeping Beauty, but a Sleeping Beau. Something happened and my alliance changed without my knowing at first. Perhaps it was the early signs of puberty, but my world, internally, was starting to be rocked. If you are wondering what perhaps you could have done differently as a father, there is practically nothing. But I won't deny the fact that for a child with a brain as active and fanciful as mine, some visits to a therapist and some psych evaluations here and there wouldn't have hurt. 

The first gift you ever gave me was my Protector, my big brother [Removed]. The second was my Caretaker. Mom. After our family, Mom is the greatest person to have ever happened to me. She, in my mind, is somewhat like a fairy godmother. She taught me the mannerisms of a lady. She taught me social graces. For the woman I was physically growing into, she was equipping me with the means I needed to survive. During this transformation of sorts, I completely forgot what happy had ever meant to me before. If I thought I'd ever been happy, I hadn't been until then. All sense of oddity that I had experienced those early years in elementary disappeared, and I let them be locked deep in the recesses of my mind into a Pandora's box. 

We can skip forward now, past our moves around and past those awful, awkward, and ugly middle and high school years. Some things that I would like to highlight however: my proclivity towards stowing away hoodies and sweatshirts at school and keeping myself covered, for taking [eldest brother]'s baggier jackets and shirts, complaining often that I felt my breasts were too large or in the way, saying even at age thirteen that I hoped someday soon I could have a breast reduction. I was covered from head to toes in scars and every time I would scratch and consequently break skin, I would hear you somehow, behind my ear saying ""Scaaaaabby Nooormal"". I was obsessed with X-Men, about the kids who knew they were different but couldn't handle it and then they were rescued and validated at a school that catered to them. Mystique was my favorite. She could be anything she wanted. I knew what I would turn into if I had her powers. And then there was Camelot 3000. I was so daft when I read that. I thought Tristain was the coolest character. You remember her? Found out she was actually a man and a knight from the Round Table? At the time I didn't know what it was about her but I really understood her.

Sure, I was whiny during all that time. I complained a lot, about everything. Some days I would be extremely self conscious and other days I would leave the house in the most flamboyant combinations from my closet. I was either fashionable or frumpy, there was absolutely no in between. I would mention here and there concerns about my weight and being ugly but it didn't stop me from eating my feelings. I only had female friends, basically. I feigned absolute prudence and modesty to avoid subjects that for some reason made me very uncomfortable. I didn't feel different anymore but I knew that I still was, and that only heightened my pursuit of perfection, so much that I rather detested myself, always held a low opinion of myself.

But that level of self-consciousness, that extremely low self-esteem, they were signs. Signs that the average parent with an average family would be incapable of recognizing, but modern research explains. 

Then I went to college. This is the allignment change I remember. Freshman year, last semester, I took a class with a highly respected, world-known child psychologist. It was called Human Growth and Development. She didn't agree with tests and quizzes, the class was heavily discussion based, and at least during our block, the discussion was always heated. Particularly, I recall the day we discussed discipline and parent-inflicted corporal punishment. I was, to my professor's surprise, on the side in favor of corporal punishment. Pain helps you remember, or isn't that what you'd always say before delivering a sentence on [eldest brother] and me? But she said something important: ""Just because your parents love you, it does not condone physical abuse."" I had always justified you by saying you handled [eldest brother] and I because that was how you were raised, you couldn't help it. I deserved it. It's character building.

Father, there are two types of people in this world: those who believe they've suffered, so why shouldn't everyone else? and those who believe they've suffered, so why should anyone else? Which one are you, dad? When you mentioned the times someone would spank you or worse as a child, I never believed that you deserved that sort of punishment. Your family supposedly loved you, they knew you were smart, talented even. They could have just... explained what you'd done wrong and taught you how to make it right. You would have understood.  I had such a low opinon of myself that I believed I deserved what you'd give. But in the eyes of the law, of medical and psychiatric professionals, perhaps even in the eyes of God, it was wrong. I do NOT hate you, and I need you to know that. But after learning through that class exactly how that affected the sort of person I was to become, I could not help but be a bit bitter at your thought process. What the hell were you thinking? This subject matter is between me, you, [eldest brother], and Grandma. No one else. Rest assured that I will never expose this secret to anyone unless I am guaranteed confidentiality in a therapist's office. But I would encourage you to imagine the look you might see on [little bothers]' faces if they ever heard that Daddy used to pull off his belt and whip Sissy and Little [eldest brother] with it. If the true Christians at your church were to know, would they clap you on the shoulder and say good on you? You are a very pensive man, and if Atlas carried the world on his shoulders then surely you carry the Universe. However, if there is one thing where I must say you failed me, it was that. I will not divulge how it affects me and my ability to engage with males. But enough time has passed since those years that we should be able to constructively discuss and agree that that was a poor, poor idea. Thank God for your wife who makes you a better man every day.

The biggest assignment in that class, the only assignment that actually mattered was to be a 25 page dissertation of sorts: a psychoanalysis of our childhoods. Basically, examining the product and then going back to see how it was made. In this, we were supposed to include a picture of our birth certificate. Some photos of us as children, maybe even a clip from a home video or two. Interviews with our immediate and extended family. Medical history. All the things that I knew would hurt you if I asked for them. We received that assignment on the first day of class and it was due on the third to last day of the semester. I was struggling emotionally because I didn't want to have to talk to Her [my biological mother] to get answers, and you know exactly who I mean. You would be even more hurt by me voluntarily contacting her, or so I presumed. 

It was the night before the paper was due, and as you can recall, I didn't actually ask you for any of those things except to answer some brief questions. I had written nothing, had nothing, and knew nothing.

When I interviewed [cousin], [eldest brother], [family friend], and Grandma, they all mentioned something that I simply did not remember: I was a very violent child. [Big Brother] and [Cousin] told me and the women were able to support that sometimes I would just start hitting [Big Brother] for no reason, to try to start something maybe. And what's odd is none of them knew I had talked to the others about this. They volunteered this information of their own accord. I remember [eldest brother] and I used to punch each other in the arm often, but I had always felt provoked. I didn't know that I was the one doing the provoking. They all mentioned how I would just cram food in my mouth and pocket it in my cheeks, like some filthy animal. About me being extremely competitive, lacking a thick skin, and in possession of serious inadequacy issues. 

Grandma told me of the times that some of the kids on the playground would come running up to me and tell me someone was picking on Michael and I would jump at the chance to fight them. I hadn't remembered that before but I remembered one of the first things you taught us was to protect each other. As I wrote the paper (which only amounted to 12 pages) and the days following, memories would come flooding in that I just hadn't... remembered before. Me beating up and scratching the face of that ginger headed kid in Hillsborough. Me sneaking out of the house in Kentucky while you were at work, Grandma was napping and [big brother] was hanging out with Travis. Timmy and Drew (the blond twin boys) coming over and Timmy telling me that I was the nicest boy he'd ever met. Ms. Z giving me vintage clothes to wear at her house while I helped her bake and kept her company (suspenders, newsboy caps, little loafers, ties...). Katherine, the tall blonde and older preschool teacher from the church in KY who I had somehow developed a nonsexual oedipal complex for. Me punching this shithead Ben in the face for pulling my hair and Katherine crying because she was so disappointed in me. My friend Bailey who was too scared to go to the bathroom by herself because she couldn't button her pants without help. She couldn't tie her shoes, zip her coat, or clean herself from a mess, but I could so I'd do it for her. A lot of memories about bugs biting my open wounds while on a soccer field. Going to the Children's Museum and using the men's bathroom with you and [big brother]. The day that Ryan, Eric, and my brother told me I couldn't hang out with them anymore because I was a girl, and me asking why that mattered at all. Having no concept of how to handle negative emotions such as grief, anger, disappointment, and sadness. Me wanting to play horsey with you and you biting me on the leg. [Big Brother] and [cousin] saying I couldn't participate in the action figure war anymore, but I could get a barbie doll and be the nurse.

I didn't know what to do with much of what was coming in, but one day while I was out irresponsibly shopping away my feelings, I found a pair of underwear... They were briefs style and had the Ninja Turtles and pizza boxes all over them. My size. I don't know why I bought them, I don't know why I put them on, but... Initiate: Alignment Change 2. Nothing had felt more comfortable or right. I started becoming a klepto, dad. I'd steal clean T-shirts and mens socks from the lost and found in the dorm laundry. One day I dared to wear not one, not two, but three sportsbras which nearly flattened my chest, and someone looked at me as I was passing in my brown combat boots and aviators and said, ""Woah, he's really beautiful."" He. They called me a he. And I... liked it. I had the urge to throw my hands up in the air and scream ""Finally!"" but still hesitated to understand why. I returned to school in the fall and took a class called ""Women and Gender Studies"", but hadn't realized I was placed in a particular class: the LGBT emphasis class. 

Enter: Mx. [Removed] Andromeda [Removed]. 6 feet tall, long, wavy blond hair, the most penetrating gaze I'd ever crossed, the most gorgeous and confident face I'd ever lain eyes on, and... the first transgender person I truly met. Of course, who else was to be the professor of such a class? Let's just say that her class was far more culturally advanced than I was prepared for and completed the alignment change. She confirmed what I had only just begun to suspect. It didn't make sense. It couldn't be true. Those things I was remembering, my brain probably made them up... Right? I started to question my reality. My self esteem, if we thought it could go no lower, surely found a way. I was sure this was just part of being an adult and I was just being over-dramatic (that's what I thought you and mom would tell me, anyway). Then things happened in the dorms and my first roommate moved out. More things happened and I was urged by not only my RA but my voice teacher and Residence Life Coordinator to seek help from the counseling center. I went, didn't know what to do, started talking to this man twice a week. He introduced me to the term ""gender dysphoria"". It's a mental health disorder. It is the crippling and debilitating anxiety one gets when they feel the people around them do not perceive them for who they are due to the body they have. And this was the reason why for the month or so prior to seeing him, I had been skipping class. I couldn't stand to be looked at, by anyone.

I wasn't a girl anymore. Was I ever? I have a girl's body, so I must be. But I'm not. I've been lying to literally everyone I know for my entire life. How can I face them now, let alone after they learn the truth? They don't know me, they don't see me. I'm not what they think but would they believe me if I tried to fix that? What if I have to use the bathroom? I have no business being in a women's bathroom, that's inappropriate. But it would look wrong for me to use the men's. What if I take a shower and someone comes in? What if the girls on my floor find out? What if they hate me, or think I'm dirty? What if they think I'm a threat? Am I a threat?

How I wish I had been born an ugly girl. This body has brought nothing but painful and traumatizing touble. I cannot stand to be looked at by straight men because all they see are my.... Now that I understood, I was so ashamed and disgusted. It was sick, how men would look at me. How they still look at me. How'd they touch me, or try to. It was perverse. Sure, my sexual preference is for men, but I'm a man too, and... I deserve better. I deserve to be respected instead of treated like a hog roast, passed around the table for all of the neanderthals to get their bite. Beauty is not a gift, it's a curse. It is possible to hate yourself even if you are blessed.

This alliance change nearly killed me because I tried so hard not to accept it. It felt unfair. I had leveled all the way up to 19, no simple task, gained skills and talents, worked so hard, only to have it all mean nothing after this change. I could barely use what I knew from life prior to then to help me go forward. I felt like I cheated, like I beat so many bosses and gained so many magical items but in reality, I  was still only a beginner. I had no right to be where I was. Dad, I was so against this alliance change that I tried to stop playing the game, and I feel you know what I mean by that. I wanted to rip up my character sheet because even if time could be rewound, even if I could just go back to how things were, I would not be the same. I would be perpetuating a lie because that was what was most convenient for me. I would have continued to be selfish, protecting myself from and resisting change because I didn't ask for it, because things might get dicey, because I might lose friends and family, because it might be hard.

Or... Or I could stop blaming the Dungeon Master(s) for making me this way, for giving me what I have and withholding from me what I don't, for presenting me with a challenge that I might fail at. I could stop... cursing the Dungeon Master(s) for taxing me with a pain that can be too much to bear. I could stop questioning the Dungeon Master(s)why me?

A Dungeon Master's decision is final. It's not up for discussion. I can go back to how I was last year, chaotic neutral and out of control, gallivanting into the sunset far far away from my problems, spending money I don't have, making friends with the wrong people, hurting you, hurting myself. Or I could accept this for what it is. 

An alliance change is what you make of it, once all is said and done. It can be the eternal end, or it can be a rebirth. Rebirth doesn't mean that the wounds attained prior to time of death go away. In fact, there will be days, even very good days, where those wounds that haunt will manifest, reopen, and weep, even if I was a good person. Even if I did do everything right. It can be an opportunity to go where no man has gone before, it can rid you of cowardice, it can make you a better person.

No decent origin story started out with ""I was normal, I never made a mistake, my life was easy and it never rained.""   No superhero makes it through their wild life without losing loved ones and getting hurt. They have their lows. Sometimes, god forbid, they lose their powers. They give in to a weakness. They make a bad judgement call that ripples out to affect the innocent bystanders. They hole up to grieve, from time to time. 

As a daughter, I failed you. No doubt this is easier for me to say than for you to agree with. I lied to you, Dad, especially if I'd had a bad day. I hid things from you, like the kids who picked on me in high school, the rumors that people would spread. I was weak, always. I rarely jumped on the opportunity to be the better person. I was loosefisted with my money, I lacked the ability to see what my actions caused and could never hold myself accountable. I was depressed, I was distressed, and I was nothing.

But as your fourth son, if you would have me, I will make this right. This is new territory for everyone, but information about it is out there for those who seek to understand, put in words for all ages. You do not have to be the one to explain to people. I will become something, someday soon. I will make a man out of myself and use all that I have learned, from you most of all, to be a good one. There is much I still don't know and ignorance may be bliss, but ignorance is the easier, weaker choice. The Day Family is a good one, and I intend to keep it that way. I will not be a coward anymore, I will not avoid life just because it might be difficult. Manners maketh man, and if that is as true as I believe it to be, then I've started off well.

I feel that you and mother are concerned with how people back home, at church, in the school district, your close friends, and our extended family would handle this news if they were ever to know, but there is undoubtedly a correct way of proceeding in this situation, and if you would like to be correct and do right by me, too, I would be happy to tell you and I will be there with you every step of the way. How anyone else feels about it is not for you to worry about at present, that is solely my responsibility. Just because something hasn't been done before, just because there would be no one else like us for miles, doesn't mean that we can't be the first and set a proper example.
 
But if the disgrace you may face that is very possible is too high a concern, if you and mom think it right to hide me as well as the truth from everyone I know and would like to continue knowing, well... Sugar coating never helped anyone in this family. Tell me now, while I am prepared to handle it. You can tell me in an email, I won't be offended. I have a purpose in this life, with a treacherous and tedious path, and you're either fully with me or not at all. I choose to embrace, survive, and thrive from this alliance change. I hold your wishes and feelings in the highest regard, and understand more than you, I daresay, the dangers of being involved with a person like me. If you choose this way, I will still be there to help you deal with it. Given the opportunity regardless of which side you choose, I will prove myself to you an adult, if not a man.

I seek to end miscommunication between us. I want to understand you as much as I can, and I want you to understand me too. Anything that you wish to know, anything that you need to ask or tell me, give it to me. You have a right to use your words, and you have a right to answers. And if I don't have the answers? For you Father, I will surely find them.

	
I love you, dad.

em69emily,asktransgender,How do I tell my SO I might be trans?,"So I'm a cis male but I'm unsure of wether or not I'm trans. I do crossdress occasionally. I thought at first it was a fetish but it's become a little more than that. I would really like to talk to my girlfriend about it, instead of having it on a loop in my mind, but I'm not sure how to bring it up. She doesn't even know that I crossdress and I'm worried about how she'll react after 4 years of being together."
The_Satellite_Mind,asktransgender,What do you say to parents who blame themselves for you being trans?,"My dad and stepmom are not having an easy time with my transition, especially my dad.  He told me that he blames himself for me being trans.  He said that he feels like he failed as a parent.  He thinks he should have ""taught me better"" because he was raised to be very masculine.

I've tried telling him that it's not his fault.  I told him that being trans is a part of who I am.  It's the way I was born and nothing he did or didn't do caused it, nor could he have done anything to change it.  I tried to explain that if he had pushed harder to make me more masculine, it would only have made me more miserable.  I even joked and said that if he wanted to blame himself for anything, he should blame himself for giving me a Y chromosome.

I feel like I'm out of options.  Having a hard time fully accepting me is one thing, but I don't want him to hate himself.  Any advice?"
AnnieHatesMe,asktransgender,"People who were functional and NOT severely depressed, did you end up transitioning?","Do you think it was the right thing to do?

I'm not depressed, and I'm quite successful by many measures but I've been struggling with gender dysphoria since I first had memories.   I'm sure that I am transgender and I'm sure that I'll struggle with dysphoria my whole life.   I'm just not sure if going through such a big change is worth the risk if I am still able to function otherwise.

Thoughts?"
Feuerstaub,asktransgender,I seem to be sure that I'm transsexual. How do I proceed now?,"Hi there. (21yo/m) I'd never imagined finding myself in this situation right now. I would've never believed I would say to myself that I'm not a guy.

My whole lifetime, I was guided by an ideal self, which indeed was masculine all the way and I never doubted that and always trusted in what I believed was right to be ""myself"". But there was this... strange feeling, since I was a child. I never talked about it but to my cousin, but we both thought we were just messing around. It was a good thing though, because I brought us to astral projection, but that's another topic.

But since then, a huge amount of time has passed. He still is my very best friend and I can't imagine telling him what I feel right now and what I wish to do in the future.

I want to get a therapist, get on hormones and ultimately get a gender-matched operation - that right now is what I wish to do in the near future. And I'm here because I have to announce that I'm... full of fear and doubt. I always trusted my ""male ideal"" and now there seems to be a ""female ideal"" which I apparantly can't trust.

Since several years, especially when it's night, no one is around anymore and I'm all by myself, I had... fantasies about being a girl, experiencing life as a girl and so on. At first glance, I told myself that these fantasies are just fetishes, but I've come to the realization that there is a lot more to that. I was obsessed about the idea of being a girl, which led me to listening to a TON of hypnosis, before going to sleep and while being asleep. I don't think they changed anything at all since I listened to them, I wished them to have effects, and they didn't. Anything after listening to these hypnosis sessions was me anyway, I have no doubt about that.

I didn't crossdress often but I did and often times still think about it - at first, I thought I did it because it aroused me, but that is not true. I don't want it to arouse me at all, I don't want to have any sexual association with it. Same shall be said about any fantasy about being or turning into a girl.

2 years have passed since I first thought about taking, trying or aiming towards female hormones. As usual, I told myself that these thoughts were just sexual fantasies I didn't want, but still arrive in my mind before bedtime. Firstly, it was the idea what hormones would do to my body and mind that kept myself extremely interested, but now that I'm sure that I have to be honest to myself, I know now that it's not an idea that wants to sexually arouse me, it's a wish that has no interest in arousing me on that primitive level.

I forgot to mention that I really want to avoid sexual intercourse or even fantasies. I don't wish that to be part of my identity or my activities in life in general. I had a girlfriend and it was great and horrible and everything that's part of that and to talk about sex, my body liked it and I hated it. If that sounds female, that says even more about what is going on in my mind. It seems like my body does not match my personality or my identity at all.

Now that I thought about what always put the thought of being a girl in mind aside, I came to a conclusion. It's not that I can't be true to myself... it's because I can't be true to my mother, my friends, my brother... I truly love my mother and I'm sure I would hurt her, taking her kind and cute boy away from her. I would hurt my little brother, who calls me ""Nii-san"" and hugs my passionately (because he sees a loving, kind, strong and protective big brother in me (Sasuke-Itachi reference here)). And when I think about my very dear friends... especially my cousin, it feels like I would need to cast away everything we've been through, like I would strip away the me they knew and destroy it.

When I think about the people I care for, it feels like I would kill their dear friend, brother and son if I continue this path and transition into being a woman. That's what causes the most fear. I mean, yes - I wouldn't be another person. I'd just have some new body parts, make-up and some new clothes. (damn when I think about clothes, there is SO MUCH COOL AND CUTE STUFF I want to wear)

Additionally, I would need to take the hormones for the rest of my life, just like the operation would be a final decision, which is why I think I should at least try to take the hormones to decide if that is the right thing to do. And that's a problem - if I started this way, and will not be sure that I should transition, or maybe even abort it, I would have that ""coming out"" and then take it all back ""nonono I'm male again, just kidding"" ... I don't want that - so basically, I fear the time before the final decisions and the failing.

What should I do? How do I master this situation? I thank you a lot for listening this little voice.

Best regards~

EDIT: I'm sorry for using ""transsexual"", I haven't been aware that there are a lot of definitions to take into account when speaking about this topic. Additionally, I have no identification issues about this - I've been born male and wish to identify as a female, but who and what I am do not interfere nor matter for each other. There is no black and white for me, which is why it doesn't matter to me too much. I want to be myself and how people call that is up to them.

ScaredTrans1,asktransgender,Is it normal to deliberately put off hormones because your scared that you'll regret HRT?,Because this is what I have been doing! I'm scared that this makes me not a transgender woman.
wrisun,asktransgender,How long does it take for the hormones to be noticeable (ftm),"I finally got my T prescription and I *really* wanna start. The only problem is my job... 
My job runs until the end of April, after which my employer can choose to extend my job or end it (it's just a temporary position). 
I don't wanna come out to them until closer to the end of my term, since I only started 2 weeks ago and I'd rather build rapport and relationships first. 

Do you think if I started now (Feb 4) my transition would be too noticeable to hide until the end of April? So that'd be about 3 months. 
If it's too risky, I plan on waiting until March 23 (my birthday) to start, since 1 month on T shouldn't be too noticeable. 

What do you guys think? Start now or wait until my birthday? "

I guess the title pretty much sums it up. I'm 19, and when I was 13 I came out to my mum as FtM. I'm pre-everything transition-wise (mostly due to severe anxiety), and I went to an ""adolescent"" GID clinic for several years (which was 100% useless, if I'm honest) and am currently on a waiting list to start attending an adult GID clinic in a few months.

The thing is, I'm quite sure that I'm not actually trans. I initially came out because of two main things: I hated my body, and, I'll admit, I was swayed a little bit by some LGBT websites I found that helped to convince me that not being feminine = being trans, or some sort of other gender variant. But I honestly don't think I've ever experienced gender dysphoria. I've wished, at times, to have a male body, but upon ""evaluation"" of my thoughts that's due to me being extremely conventionally unattractive (with a very masculine face; I thought being a man would ""suit"" my face more and may stop me feeling so ugly) and being very overweight most of my life (I always viewed male bodies as more slender by default, and so hoped that if I became male my body wouldn't be as fat). But I've never felt a sort of disconnect from my primary or secondary sexual characteristics. I dislike them, but not because they're female; I dislike them because I dislike my body and appearance overall.

So, I think that the main reason for my discomfort in my body is my weight, and resultant (suspected) ED. I've never actually been diagnosed, but since I was ~11 I've been engaging in behaviours very particular to bulimia (and, on occasion, forms of EDNOS). I think one of the reasons I continued thinking I had gender dysphoria for so long was that I've never told anybody about my issues with my weight or eating - out of shame, as I was afraid I wouldn't get taken seriously as an overweight person with an ED - and so for the last 5 years I've been ""out"" as trans to my close family and some ex-friends.

But.. that's wrong. I'm *not* transgender, or gender-variant, or anything like that. Granted, I don't particularly conform to any sort of gender roles and I do prefer to have a traditionally ""masculine"" appearance, but I identify as cisgender, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to ""un-come-out"" to my family. I know it's incredibly selfish of me to worry about this, as so many people face the opposite problem, but my mum is TOO suportive; a few years ago, I actually tried to voice to her some of my concerns about not being transgender, but she shut me down on the grounds that I was ""just scared of transitioning"". I've been too scared to bring it up since.

Ideally I'd like to ""un-come-out"" within the next month or so, as I'm on a waiting list to start attending an adult GIC, and the waiting list is very long (upwards of a year since referral); I can't bear the guilt of knowing that I'm taking up someone else's place on the list, so I'm desperate to get myself removed from it. I'm just not sure how to broach the subject, and I'm not sure how to convince my mum that my doubts don't stem from pre-transition nerves. 

I'm also terrified of telling her about my issues regarding food and my weight, as she doesn't ""believe"" I was ever overweight and since I'm not diagnosed I don't think she'll take me seriously at all.

Has anybody here got any experience with de-transitioning? Admittedly I *am* pre-everything, but that term seemed the most accurate.

Thank you very much if you can give me any sort of advice.

-- If it's relevant, I'm not currently seeing a therapist (I stopped seeing my last one in December) but I'm trying to find a new one. I also *do* have a history of anxiety and depression and currently suffer from extremely bad agoraphobia - hence my mum being convinced I'm ""still"" transgender. I'm also suspected of having a psychotic disorder of some sort, after having a bad psychotic episode at 15, and I'm aware that might affect my thought processes in some way so that may be relevant too."
Cocoaislife,asktransgender,Has a stranger ever correctly gendered you despite knowing your deadname and you presenting as such?,"So I work at this assisted care retirement home (I'm not out there yet). Because I work in the kitchen, I usually wear a hat and put my hair in a bun, but today I decided to leave it down (covered with a hair net ofc). 

Anyways, I had to stock the kitchen in the building where the residents with dementia/alzheimers live, and on the way I passed by a certain resident. I like to think of him as the building greeter since he has stopped me a few times to ""meet"" me. As usual I wished him a good morning as I walked towards him. This time, he smiles and signals me to stop so he can read my name tag. It still has my deadname on it, which is an obvious guy's name, so I started to freak out a little on the inside. However, after he was finished reading it he extended his hand like usual, and with the same smile clearly said, ""It is nice to meet you ma'am."""

I don't like the facial hair, but I can pretty much keep it under control by shaving every day, but if I'm getting electro I can hardly shave because it needs to be long enough to zap.

LangMeYourLight,asktransgender,I don't want to freeze my sperm. Is that okay?,"There are several reasons why.

The second: I don't want to be a biological father.  I don't want kids that remind me of my genitals every time I look at them.  I don't want to be anything even remotely resembling a father.  I'd rather have the exact same relationship that an adoptive mother would, i.e., taking on the mother role with an adopted child.  (I hate kids in general, but I am open to adoption.)

Adding on to the second: Blood is overrated.  Some of the most beautiful families are adopted, and some biological parents treat their kids like dog turds.  

The third: My genes are crap.  All sorts of diseases on both sides of the family tree.  

The fourth: I would hate to make all the lifestyle adjustments and change everything including the way I sit (I never ""manspread""), the clothes I wear, my diet, shower temp, etc., all so I can have that consolation prize ""father"" relationship to my children.

The fifth: The cost.

pinkchips,asktransgender,"I just want her to know that everything is gonna be ok. If you see her, please tell her for me.","I used to spend my most cherished nights alone,  
away from the judgement and expectations of the world,  
I would light up inside thinking of the evening planned for myself,  
And I knew the hours of preparation would be worth it,  
The hours shaving my body,  
And fumbling with makeup,  
Squeezing into impractical and outlandish outfits,  
All leading up to that one magical instant,  
Looking in the mirror,  
And seeing *her*,  
Thinking back I can't believe I never cried in those moments,  
Tears of joy if nothing else,  
But to my testosterone brain the idea would have been silly,  
And besides I was usually drunk by that point,  
Or at least tipsy.  
I danced and drank with myself through the night,  
I had labyrinthine libraries of pictures of fully clothed women on my computer,  
This was my 'sick thrill',  
My secret shame,  
Pretending I was a woman and had girlfriends to hang out with,  
I tried to imagine how a woman must feel about a man,  
And how that would be to be surrounded by such companionship and support,  
But I'm lying to you,  
And possibly lying to myself some,  
I could never allow myself such joy,  
No,  
There always had to be some hateful and dominating figure forcing me into such a role,  
Because it was an accursed thing, right?  
This is obviously how all men feel,  
And I'm just one of the few pathetic enough to surrender to these desires,  
And though I am spilling so many tears remembering and writing this,  
At the time there were no tears,  
Only vodka.  Sometimes gin.  
Until at last, in the wee morning hours,   
Collapsed from an orgasmic state I was likely too blacked out to remember,  
I passed out at the most convenient spot,  
To awaken to a murderous hangover,  
And my shameful smeared harlot face.  
I would look wearily in the mirror,  
Knowing that I needed to stop this,  
Knowing this horror must die,  
YOU GOTTA GET IT TOGETHER  
I washed my shame from my face,  
And crumbled my stupid costume into the corner,  
And there was no sadness,  
Just a grey resignation,  
As I would go about the rest of my cold day,  
Or perhaps not,  
Let's just sit and stare at the wall today?  
I hate myself.  
  
And that's how the story would have ended I think.  
Not with a suicide,  
Just with a grey fog,  
That slowly enveloped my soul until a natural oblivion at last accepted me,  
  
And there's no way to properly express,  
A decision that took years to make,  
And was critiqued in my harshest internal courts endlessly,  
But I remember at last thinking,  
""Nobody is going to make you do this,  
Except for you.  
So do it.  And let the consequences come.  
Let the misery and shame commence.""  
  
Such a fool even then!  
**That such a creature dying of thirst would believe that the lake in front of it was poisonous!**  
  
And it has passed.  
That storm is done.  
The darkness vanquished.  
And this is the other side.  
  
I have friends now.  I have women in my life who love me, the real me, and I spend my most cherished days and nights with them.  
Why wouldn't I?  I have so much joy and happiness to give to the world, and every day I feel it grow.  
Like a desperately parched field, the estrogen came like a welcome rain,  
Then a flood,  
And the countryside of my emotions that had been withered for so long,  
Now springs with newfound emerald life.  
I cry so many tears now.  
And they are tears of happiness and regret both,  
But I love it,  
I love crying,  
It gives me release and understanding unto myself,  
And honestly,  
Who has time to drink alcohol when there's so many delicious things to feel?  
I have amazing and adorable outfits now,  
And thanks to modern technology,  
I don't have to shave my body,  
And I don't have horrible pain and irritation for days,  
As my penance for wanting to be feminine and soft,  
No,  
I pay that pain all at once,  
When she hits me with that blessed laser,  
But it's so worth it.  
Because of all the newfound time I have to spend perfecting my makeup,  
Because yes, there is a deadline now!  
Who gets dolled up and stays at home?  
Not when there is such a magical world out there waiting to be explored.  
And though I do not look completely female yet,  
My brain runs on the same chemicals that any other woman's does,  
The ones it always should have had,  
And I truly feel completely feminine,  
Down to my core and soul,  
It's not even a question anymore,  
A temporarily homely woman perhaps,  
Growing cuter by the day,  
And I am happy to own myself and body,  
And if people get confused I am happy to explain my transition,  
There is so much happiness in this world,  
So many friends and good memories,  
Food runs wild with tastes and spices,  
Even old songs dance with melodies as if I've never heard them before,  
I sometimes have to stop and take in the beauty of something I'm seeing,  
Because it's like I've been in a stupor,  
For a jaunt-like length of years,  
And now I wear this stupid grin on my face,  
Only this is a happy ending,  
My happy ending,  
  
I can't believe I waited this long to allow myself to have it,  
And these tears are the most fierce of all,  
Falling down and wetting the screen of my phone as I write this,  
I just want to go back to years ago,  
And hug that lonely girl,  
Because I have so much love to give now,  
And she needed it most of all,  
Just a hug,  
Just an understanding moment,  
She was always a girl.  
She was just imprisoned,  
And hurting,  
  
I love her so much,  
She did her best,  
She escaped,  
And now I am the inheritor of her successful struggle,  
This developing body,  
This blissful mind,  
This paradise life,  
  
And I just want her to know,  
That's it's going to be ok.  
  
Everything is gonna be ok.

That said, since I started doing this, I have been more and more uncomfortable with my body. I've always felt like it's about to fall apart, but while I've been mostly content, I have noticed things a lot more, from my shoulder width to the shape of my chin, to body hair which I had previously shrugged off.

I started my transition as soon as I could to take advantage of my age, because I've heard that your hip growth plates don't fuse until you're 25. 

But here's the thing, I hit 6 foot by the time I was 12. I was at least two years ahead of everyone my age when it came to my body. I'm concerned that due to my tendency to be an early bloomer I've already lost out on the opportunities that being 18 provide for me.

I've given HRT time to even this out but it just hasn't happened. I think this is an outcome of low dose HRT. Choices would be to go full dose HRT and hope for changes or to possibly quit HRT altogether. 

I want my sex drive and desire back. It's such an important part of feeling ""alive"" for me. And I'm not saying I need my male drive back. I need ANY drive and desire back. To walk through life with nothing is just killing me. Learned it's such an important part of being human to me.

Curious to your experience on HRT around this subject or any advice you might have........

Thanks.      "
its_snorlax,asktransgender,Trying to get HRT. What do I need to know about insurance?,"I still feel very stuck on trying to get HRT. I want to get it over with as soon as possible, but I honestly have no idea how health insurance works so I'm gonna have to try asking for help here.

My parents are divorced. I live with my mom and her boyfriend. My dad lives somewhere else, but I'm insured under him with Kaiser Permanente. We live in SoCal, and he works for Northrop Grumman.

If I were to start receiving HRT under his insurance, would either he or my mom be able to find out? If so, is there a way to mask what it is I'm getting?

How do I know if I even can get HRT under my plan? I recall checking what I was covered for on the Kaiser website, but saw nothing about HRT specifically. I did see things related to transgender health services, but I don't know if HRT would fall under those.

Also, say I want to try an informed consent clinic. What kind of information about me/my insurance would I need to provide in order to do that? What kind of things should I know or have memorized/on hand when trying to make an appointment?

Sorry if these questions are vague or don't make a whole lot of sense. I'm really stumbling around in the dark here and there's only so much I can ask my parents without pretty much outing myself."

--

I can't fucking breathe properly right now. It feels like my chest wants to explode while at the same time implode. All I know is, it's suffocating me. I can't even cry properly because if I put my face in my hands, my chest touches my arms. I can't bear anything touching my chest. I can barely stand up because I can feel something hanging.

My chest is covered by two repulsive pieces of dead flesh just hanging from my ribcage. Sure, they could've been bigger but they're big enough to cause an enormous amount of discomfort and unease.

My feet are small. My hands are small. I look eight years younger than I am just because of this babyface. Not even my voice helps. There's nothing about my appearance that lets people know who I *really* am. All they see is an ill-fitting costume I never asked for. A costume nobody can see through. I hate feeling invisible.

If I make the stupid decision to look at myself in the mirror, my brain instantly sends error messages. Like a fucking siren going off in my head.

WRONG. ERROR 404. BODY NOT FOUND.

A body *is* found but not the one I'm supposed to be seeing in the mirror. It's like there's someone else staring back at me. A confused someone I hardly recognize as being me.

I can't even ask for a hug because I don't want anyone or anything to touch me. I don't want to *feel* this body because it doesn't fucking belong to me. I'm inside it but it's not me.

The icing on the cake? The fact that pms makes all of this a thousand times worse. Yet another feature that makes me feel so far from reality. I'm not even supposed to have pms. What's even more awesome? The thing that comes after having suffered through the pms. Fucking great.

I feel grotesque, disproportionate and hopeless a lot of the time. I don't even feel like HRT will help. Nothing will. I'll always be stuck in this body. Top surgery is so far away and I don't think I can last that long. I just want it all to go away. Bottom surgery sucks. I just want a normal body.

How do you remove yourself from your body when the dysphoria gets unbearable?

How do you cope?"

I asked the medi-cal people wether I go  straight to the counselors or to the doctor first (I heard you need to do a year worth of therapy before going on hormones.) but they didn't know. do I go to the doctor tell him I want to transition then he will send me to the counselor? Or go straight to the counselor and seeing the doctor is just a waste of time. Should I see both? And if so in what order?

master_mr_meister,asktransgender,Just how?,"I started HRT today. For the last few years I've been incredibly depressed because of who I was pretending to be and my ridiculous assumption that it would be impossible. I ""knew"" that there'd be gatekeepers and vitriol and waiting, and I would never get the treatment that I need.

Two nights ago I was browsing The Strand with a friend and I decided ""Fuck it. I'll swing by callen-lorde and add a few brochures and information pamphlets to the massive stack of things that I would someday. For once, I decided to actually ask person at the front desk. Maybe if get something new, a differently phrased version of what I had dozens of already. He asked if I wanted to make an appointment.

I figured what the hell and said sure. He listed the open dates, Thursday (today) or April. I panicked. Before I could convince myself that I could wait a little longer my mouth was already saying I was available today (not even thinking about possibly missing work).

Last night I didn't sleep. I was so scared of the future and excited and worried about oversleeping, so of course I got there hours early (long before anyone that works there even showed up). My appointment lasted less than an hour. It's a cliché new beginning.

So to anybody out there who thinks that it's too hard or others will try to stop you, maybe you're right. Maybe it will be difficult. It sure as hell has been for me. But maybe, just maybe something will go right and you'll be left knowing that everything is going to be okay."
PavementBlues,asktransgender,"At long last, I am completely out. My dad will be reading my coming out letter this evening, though, and I'm scared.","I finally did it. I wrote the letter, sent it off, had the last few conversations that I needed to have with family members, and came out on Facebook. Nearly four months after switching to presenting female in my day-to-day life and ten months after posting here for the first time, I am now 100% socially out.

One the one hand, it feels incredible to finally have the ""People to Come Out to Personally"" list completed. It was exhausting and seemed impossible when I started, but here I am, with no one left to tell. It's a huge weight off of my shoulders.

On the other hand, however, my dad hasn't read the letter yet. I guess I shouldn't be too anxious, since I won't be discussing it with him for a long time. My step-mom and I talked through it and agreed that it would be best for the two of us to not talk until he's had a chance to process the news, which realistically could be years. It took him six months to speak to me again after I told him that I was bisexual.

I still can't stop thinking about his reaction, though. Even with his flaws, he has been a fantastic father, and I learned a lot of really important values from him that shaped who I am today. I respect him more than just about anyone else on the planet. Waiting for him to read my letter has been the most frightening experience of my transition, and I wish that I could just fast forward through it. It's so much easier to deal with the fallout than it is to wait for the detonation.

There's no question or advice or information this time, sorry. I'd just feel better talking about this than sitting here gnawing off the tips of my fingers. This sucks."
Valindrian,asktransgender,Am I ruining my chance at kids by starting on testosterone?,"I have an appointment to start the process to get me on testosterone (it's just the initial blood work but since my local Planned Parenthood works on informed consent I'll be able to get T the next appointment). I'm really excited but I still have one hangup about it. I want kids someday. I'm very sure I want kids someday. I'm not opposed to adopting or a surrogate but I'd really prefer carrying my own biological child (and I know kids are expensive to begin with but as a side note, freezing my eggs, adopting, or a surrogate are all very expensive and I don't see myself having that amount of money to spend on just starting the process of parenthood). Since there's not a lot of studies (read:none) on the long term effects of testosterone on fertility of FtM folks who keep their plumbing I have nothing to go on. I've heard some awesome success stories which warm my heart and give me hope but I want to know what my realistic chances of ever being about to get pregnant after long term exposure to testosterone is. Or if there's any way to minimize chances of infertility.
Freezing eggs isn't really a possibility for me either at this stage. I don't have $10,000 to drop on that right now.
Anyway, any experiences or knowledge on the subject would be greatly appreciated! Thanks."

Lil_Gigi,asktransgender,How to deal with transphobic parents?,"I have known I was a transgirl from the time I was 13 (I'm 18 now and a senior in high school). I came out to my parents at 14 and they told me the following:

1) If I start a transition, they will disown me.
2) If I ever dress as a girl, they will disown me.
3) If I pursue anything in the transgender realm, they will disown me.
Seeing a pattern?

I'm so sick of them not letting me be myself. It's taken me 4 years to convince them to let me grow my hair out to the point where there's actually something that can be cut. My therapist and I have been trying since the beginning to help get them learn to accept it. They know I will be living full-time as a girl when I go to college and they said the minute I do that, they will cut off all support for me. If it wasn't for a scholarship I have at a state school, there would be no way I could afford college. 

I have done things I am not proud of to get them to see how much I'm hurting. I've cut, burned, scalded, ran away, and more. But it only made things worse. I was sent to a psychiatric ward 3 times, released early all 3 times because they realized that my parents were just being assholes. 

But there has to be some way to get them to see...I know a lot of people are going to say that I should just wait until college, it's only one semester away, etc. but I need something before then. Because even when I do go to college, I have barely any money, and I do not have any wardrobe whatsoever. So even when I get to college, I will not be able to live as a girl until I get more money to buy clothes and makeup and more. 

TL;DR: My parents are extremely transphobic and I need help getting them to see that this isn't ""a phase""."

WynneN,asktransgender,Can some of you give me a pep talk?,"Hello all...I'm kind of at a standstill and could use a pep talk....
I'm a 55 y/o MTF who like so many in my age groups just didn't think transition was a possibility 30 some years ago. After failed relationships, not great behavior, knowing deep down what this issue was but afraid to face it etc, I finally came to grips with who and what I am about a year and a half ago and after some time in therapy I was able to start HRT one year ago.
My progress has been reasonably good (I have some pics posted in other subs), at my age and height I have realistic expectations of passing. Also because I am entrenched in the business sector the idea of being stealth is impossible.
I'm lucky to be financially secure and in a leadership role at our company. I also have a high profile position in a well known charitable organization. It is important for me to look as professional and appropriate as possible so I have worked with someone who has been helping me assemble the proper wardrobe.
My name change order has already been done, and the next step is to change my drivers license and SSN. Once I do that, I will have to notify HR. It is at that point where I would communicate to the managers and employees what is going on, likely take a week off and return as the new me. This is where I'm stuck right now and I'm frozen.
Every other step I've made in this journey has progressed one after the other, and I'm sure this one is not because this is the one with all the finality. The family and friends who know are supportive, but I am very concerned about the professional environment. Our team here, our vendor partners and our clients.

This is more a request for anyone in the UK but if anyone can help i will greatly appreciate it... I'm also MtF if that helps any!

Over Christmas i pretty much put my transition on ice to wait until my local GP quietened up (I was struggling to get an appointment and for some reason decided to wait until the start of 2017) but now that I've just come back from my appointment and got blood tests sorted i feel almost worse than ever. I've been told that my local GIC hasn't updated on where i am in the waiting list (its been 6+ months since i was referred) and I've been denied premature storage of sperm so i may use Dr Webberly's bridging hormone service (so i can get hormones whilst i wait). This pretty much means if i don't wait longer i cant one day have biological kids. This isn't a make or break factor for me but it really hurts that i have to risk waiting several more months or not have kids. I know patience is key but i'm running out of patience.

This isn't my only problem though... I spoke to my GP about my general unhappiness with my life and my lack of motivation. How I've been loosing sleep rapidly and i feel disconnected from my friends and family. How i literally want to do nothing no matter how hard i try. I feel like i'm just doing life for the sake of it now. Hell, i didn't mention it to her but i cut my arm a few weeks back and the cuts are finally healed enough for me to wear short sleeves again. I just feel useless. But she told me that anyone in my situation would feel like that, and i just need to talk to people. She told me to speak to people further down the line of transition and get them to tell my why i shouldn't rush and that it gets better. It seemed like she didn't even listen to me.

I feel like i'm running out of options and i don't know how to get my life back on track again... I used to know where to start but now its all too much to tackle. I kinda hoped a friend or a parent would've stepped in by now and decided that i'm not okay but nobody seems to notice or care.

Sure, my transition is 'supported' (or at least tolerated by most) but i don't feel like I am being supported.

What should i do? Should i get a second opinion from a new GP? should i get counselling again? (the last time i had counselling they told me after 2 months of sessions i didn't need it...) Is this just one of those things that will work out? or do i need something else?

But you can't guarantee that you can keep being the man that your wife wants. You might sometimes have some womanly desires like she does, and she might be unhappy because she is a straight woman.

_Tiresias_,asktransgender,Am I transgender?,"(I’m relatively new to a lot of this so I’m sorry if I use wrong terminology or say anything offensive accidentally)  

Recently I’ve been questioning a lot of stuff and I’d appreciate some perspective. I’m going to try and describe my experiences and if anyone can bear with it to the end and comment, I’d really appreciate it. Sorry it's long.   
  
So for years (the earliest I can remember it is since middle school), I’ve always been attracted to the more feminine side of things than most guys. It’s showed up in small ways. I painted my nails with paint from an art set I had. I tried on a dress when I was home alone.  That was as far as I could go since I was living at home, but I know I would have gone a bit farther if I could have.  And recently, I’ve moved out somewhat and am living in a dorm at college. Even still I couldn’t do much but buy nail polish and paint my toenails and hide them since I share a room. Recently though, I told my friend about being curious about all of that stuff, and she’s been amazing about helping me. I’ve gotten to try on cute outfits and dresses and go all out with makeup and nail polish and everything. We even went outside and walked around for a few minutes when I was like that, which was both terrifying and exhilarating. And I want it to look as real as possible and I’m planning on getting stuff to help with that. It’s not just the clothes though, we picked out a name for me and it’s really nice to hear it and to be referred to using female pronouns. And the way I act and talk changes a bit, but that’s subtler and hard to describe.  

How does doing all that stuff make me feel? Really good actually. It makes me happy to wear a dress and feel cute and be treated as female. I feel happy and it just feels good to express myself like that. It’s something new and different and fun. And I’ve always had the urges to do it, and now I’ve been able to and it makes me happy.
  
If I was able to wear dresses and look cute in normal everyday life and have it be accepted, I would do it in a heartbeat. If I could have people refer to me as my female name and use those pronouns, I would. It just makes me happy for some reason. And if it was possible somehow to switch instantly with no consequences and have everyone think I was always female, I would.  
  
But the thing is, I don’t hate being male. Maybe it’s not the perfect body, but I don’t actively hate it. I’m not constantly thinking about it or feel an extremely strong desire to switch. I definitely don’t want to transition, because that’s a lot of work and time and money and uncertainty for something I don’t feel extremely strongly about. So I’m fine being male, even if I want to be female. 
  
I don’t feel like I have two separate genders. It’s just me. Both sides are a part of who I am. I don’t switch between anything, it's all who I am.  I’m just not able to express who I actually am.
  
Am I transgender? Am I gender fluid? Am I bigender? Am I somewhere in between male and female? Am I just a guy who likes girl things? I’m not sure but I’d appreciate any thoughts you guys have

Does this group even exist because i know a lot of people who first question if they are trans initally worry it is a fetish or something? Is there a name for that because as part of my journey i would like to read about it to see what distinctions there are between that group of people and truly trans people.

hanacch1,asktransgender,Continuing treatment in Canada after beginning in the USA,"I am not making this post for myself, but for my girlfriend, who does not use Reddit. The story goes like this.

She is a Canadian citizen, who moved to the USA with her family (Texas) and began her transition. Went through therapy/endocrinology/prescription. She has been on HRT for 3.5 years, so nothing new for her. 

She flew here to visit me after filling her prescription, and is now out of medication. Short of sending her home to refill, as it is her intention to continue living with me at this time, I have supplemented with some of my own for now, but she needs to get her prescription updated so that she may resume treatment here in Canada. 

My question to you is, having previously started HRT in the states, what steps can she skip in the process here? My assumption is that upon presenting her original prescription she could be ""fast-tracked"" through the system to refresh her prescription, but I am by no means a professional. I live in Quebec, if that helps any, and am doing my own research but would love some input from people who might be more experienced.

yplus,asktransgender,Masculinizing HRT options for cis-males?,"Hello,

I am a mid-30s cis-male (interested in life extension) but when I was little I looked a bit like a girl and to this day I have many feminine body 
characteristics like very little body hair, feminine hands and a high pitched voice. 

I want to become more masculine, grow body hair and have a deeper voice. Although I go to the gym and have developed my pecs I seem to have mild Gynecomastia and pointy nipples that are very noticeable if I wear a tight fitting shirt. I'm just not sure if a doctor would consider it serious enough or not.

I am interested in something like danazol. Would this be suitable for me as it should help deepen my voice and get rid of the Gynecomastia?

Are there other options I should consider?

Are you guys OK with me asking this or am I about to get flammed or at the very least told this is a question for a completely different subredit?

I am thinking along the lines of reading the body of knowledge used for female-to-male sex change and using it to help myself become more masculine.

And, at this point, I have a hard time even finishing without rubbing down there. I know it might sound silly, but I can't help but wonder if I've always done that subconsciously because I've known on a deep, instinctual level that the parts I have now just aren't right.

ozythemandias,asktransgender,Why is everyone upset about Trump rescinding Obama's bathroom protection?,"First off, apologies if I say something wrong, its out of ignorance. 

My impression is that Trump's position regarding public schools and their policies should be left to the state and local school's directives. I did some research this morning and turns out, public school is a state responsability:

&gt; Education is primarily a State and local responsibility in the United States. It is States and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds, that establish schools and colleges, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation. The structure of education finance in America reflects this predominant State and local role. Of an estimated $1.15 trillion being spent nationwide on education at all levels for school year 2012-2013, a substantial majority will come from State, local, and private sources. This is especially true at the elementary and secondary level, where about 92 percent of the funds will come from non-Federal sources.


Based on this, Trump's refusal to involve the Federal government should be welcomed. Do we really want the federal government involved in more aspects of our lives? 


Edit: Some of the comments have been really informative. I'd like to rephrase my question: Is it possible that this was simply a policy driven decision based on the above as opposed to an attack on anyone's rights?"

Most of my friends, and I myself, are Asian males who care more about their scores on their latest chemistry or math test than our own identities. I sometimes do see a transgender group at school, but I later realized that I don't share any classes with them. It seems like there are no transgender people in the most challenging math or science classes, which are dominated by asians like me. 
So my question is: If being transgender is independent of most factors, why is it that I never see transgender people in the social circles that I'm in? Or more appropriately phrased: why are there no transgender people at the top of the STEM Pack? By top of the STEM pack, I mean like people who do well in Intel Science Fair, Google Science fair,  the USA National Science and Math Olympiads.

mehsky,asktransgender,MTF - Forced to use female facilities before ready.

I can finally grow out my hair thanks to my approved exceptions to policy and continue to medically transition. Unfortunately, I now also have to use female facilities. My command insisted I put that ETP in my request even though I was hesitant. I wanted to get this through ASAP before I transfer this summer, so I went along with it instead of fighting them about it. 

Well, now I have to use the female facilities with my short hair and with people who have known me as a male for four years. I really don't know how to go about this without it being awkward for myself and every person that is surprised to see me in the female bathroom. 

I was thinking of typing up little pieces of paper that say something simple about the fact that, yes, I am a transgender women and that part of the transition process I am required to use female facilities. Something simple that I can just hand them, instead of trying to explain myself awkwardly in the bathroom.

In general, I hae become more feminine. My clothing choices are more feminine, mannerisms and posture from vocal practice have found their way into my everyday life. But its not enough - dysphoria still controls my life. Its gotten to the point that anytime I am overtly feminine, and doing everything I wish I could, wearing the clothes that I picked to highlight my best features and using the voice and posture habits Ive worked so hard to develop for the past 6 months, I feel like a fraud. I know the size of the shoulder and biceps Im trying to hide. I know how much concealer I need to cover up my beard. All of this just plants so much doubt in my mind that Im not valid, and I feel paralyzed. I dont even want to think of coming out to the public yet - theres so much that can go wrong. Im just sick of being unhappy. I want to feel good about my body for once in my life. I see so many people on here that accept themselves. I want to be like that.

feedtheskitty,asktransgender,"Anyone ever become intentionally ""misgendered"" the wrong way?","So I was talking to this lady from my insurance company.

VagueClarity,asktransgender,Struggling with bulimia.,"This is my first post here, and I apologize that it's not phrased as a question. I've read a lot of other threads here, but I never feel like I have anything to offer, so I also apologize for never having shown up here before.

I'm 5'10"" and 117 pounds. I came out to my parents recently, and we're working through everything. As I'm still living with them (I'm moving out to go to university next year) and am still reliant on them, I'm a little worried because they don't want me to start hormones or anything. I don't want to make them sound like bad people, because they aren't, but they've been asking a lot of questions like, ""are you sure?"" and, ""have you ever been attracted to a girl?"" and, ""do you even know what female anatomy looks like?"" It worries me because, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure, and I think I might be bisexual (and I think they'd use that as another excuse to deny it), and I've only seen diagrams in my A&amp;P books (I've never watched porn or anything). It's making me feel more and more like a liar for even saying anything.

Sorry for the short rant. On to the main topic. When I came out to them, I also admitted I'd been bulimic for a while (I said the past 5 days, but it's been over 2 weeks). They made me promise I'd stop, but it's really hard to get over this feeling. I've gotten used to eating less than 500 calories a day, then throwing it back up when I do eat, so it's hard to eat at all. I can't get over looking in the mirror and seeing the fat on my arms and stomach and thinking, ""this has to go."" I even got to the point that I wanted to starve myself to lose muscle mass.

Has anyone else here developed an eating disorder to cope with being transgender? I feel like it's strange and wrong to want to lose weight so I can feel justified in my transition, and I'd really appreciate some input on this. How do you get over an eating disorder? I get tired of hearing people say stuff like, ""it's okay to eat more."" Logically, I know this is true, but considering I was maintaining a weight of ~125lbs for quite some time on 600-800 calories a day, I'm worried that if I start eating ""like normal"" I'll gain a bunch of weight. Do you think this even has anything to do with wanting to transition, or is that just another excuse? I can't wrap my mind around everything; I'm so confused right now.

I'm also worried because, despite saying that I'm trans, I can't envision myself as a woman. I hate my body as it is right now, and I don't want to be male, but I talked to my therapist quite a lot about it and I don't really have anything particularly feminine that I wish for or envy others for. And yes, I know that cis people generally don't wonder about their gender identity, but I also worry if maybe I was just influenced by things around me (I read a lot of stories about trans people and gender confusion).

AbigailRothko,asktransgender,"There's No Hope for Us Dating, Is There?","I’m a straight MtF. I’ve reached the point in my transition where I pass without problem, so I decided to give dating a try. 

I’m not sure what I expected, but I didn’t think it’d be so depressing.

I live in a big city, and given the non-existence of my social life, Tinder was the best option for me. Being an objectively hot girl (as many of my matches, pretty hot themselves, have said), I’ve had no trouble amassing an ungodly amount of options. Because I’m new to dating, I have been disclosing it pretty soon, usually as soon as the guy wants to switch to texting.

90% are gone by that point. They either unmatch without saying anything, or tell me they’re not into that kind of thing. Some say that they’d be fine, but ghost on me shortly after.

So I decide to wait a bit longer, and do a better job about gauging possible rejection. I match with this wonderful guy, we hit it off, text a good bit over several days, and decide to get lunch. I tell him the night before I’m trans. It made a difference to him. He said he has trans friends, is super liberal/progressive, sees me 100% as a woman, all that. But he said there’s this persistent feeling that’s not allowing him to feel good about being in a relationship with a trans woman. 

We still did lunch, but just as friends. He said that I’m stunning and smart, and that I should have no trouble finding someone to date. But if someone as open and accepting as him still has a problem dating me only because I’m trans, then who will? 

This was more of a rant than a question, but if anyone has any success stories or advice, I’ll gladly hear them. "

aloadofdaftpunk94,asktransgender,"Someone needs to help educate my dumb a**, please.","Recently I have questioned lots of what I thought was right and true because of a silly argument I got into the other day when I tried to protect a trans online friend but ending up insulting them when I said something offensive. I feel kinda stupid and want to be educated by people who have to deal with ignorant cis people like me almost everyday. 
So here is what happened, I was of the understanding that transgender people [I'm not going off any dictionary definitions just my own I have thought were right since I was around aged 15] are people born a certain sex but are a different gender to what that sex/gender grouping usually is. The thing I said was (whilst trying to defend him from a troll) ""Yes...he's female but he is a man, you are getting sex and gender mixed up"". My friend hated this, and got mad at me. Now I thought to this day that sex was something we are all born with and can never change? (am I so totally way off the mark with that?) and gender is in fact a fluid scale which, no matter what sex we a designated at birth..it has no bearing on what are gender is. So, I asked my friend is it the fact that female and male as actually words are stupidly linked to femininity and masculinity and I asked if I should use XY and XX instead when talking about sex. And he got mad and didn't reply or speak to me since. 
Now, I know I f**ked up, I just wasn't aware that this would upset him. Is that a problem all trans people have a problem with? Are some trans offended and others not and you just have to find out before you hurt someones feeling on a person by person basis? Is it due to people always getting mixed up between sex and gender? Or am I just a jerk missing the whole picture? So many questions, any answers will help. Thanks!"
AtAurora,asktransgender,"Came out as trans to my identical twin, turns out they're non-binary. Things got deep/interesting.","**EDIT: Thank you all so much for the support! Did not expect to get this much attention. I hope you all have a good life and stay safe. Seems like I'll still be alive for many more years to come.**

So I finally fucking did it, I told my twin I'm trans. I'm aware this isn't a question, but I'm happy about this, I wanted to share it, and this is the most used trans subreddit. Things got really interesting so here is a full narrative on exactly what happened. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if there are any weird grammar or formatting mistakes. Also TW for suicide, and self harm. This is also really long so I'll put in a TL;DR at the end.


It was late and we had just dropped a friend off at his house, and we were talking about how there are things about us that nobody knows about. My twin told me that they knew something about me that I didn't know they knew. I was really interested, so I asked them what it was. I thought they were going to say that they knew I'm trans. Instead they told me that they knew about my suicide attempt back in May. I wasn't surprised they knew. They then admitted to having their own thoughts and even told me that if I were ever truly planning it again, and they couldn't stop me, they would join me. I always kind of knew that as well.


The conversation kept going, and more things unraveled. They then told me that there was something about themself that they wanted to tell me. That's when my twin came out as bisexual and that they were actually planning to come out to our friends that day, but was too afraid to. We were already talking so I decided fuck it I'll tell tell them. I told them them that despite me coming out as bi years before, I might just be heterosexual, but that I was into guys. I saw the gears in their head slowly start turning as they got what I was implying. They told me that  they weren't surprised  (I would hope so considering how many obvious hints I gave). They then admitted to also being non-binary (hence why I've been using they/ them pronouns). I wasn't surprised either.


At this point we were already home, but we decided to stay in the car. We talked about me wanting to fully transition and how they would even go with me to get hrt, even if they don't plan to get any themself. They even told that they would present as female one day in public with me (luckily we already look pretty androgynous so some well placed makeup would be sufficient to pass). When we finally left the car and got inside I told them my preferred pronouns and name, after they tried to think of some names for me, some were pretty good. We stayed up until 1 am talking. We agreed that we would go to each other for help, and that they would come out as bi to our friends sometime this week through text. I also agreed to come out as trans on Sunday when we all get together again. There are still some things I'm not ready to tell my twin yet, like my self harming and the multiple scars I have that aren't on my wrists, but I'll be strong enough some day. Right now I'm at peace. The most important person in my life knows me a lot better now, and honestly we probably just saved each other's lives.


TL;DR My identical twin came out as a depressed non-binary bisexual, and I came out as a depressed trans girl with one suicide attempt. We are both more at peace, because now we have each other."

--nja,asktransgender,"datapoint for US Passport applicants who updated gender, but not name on last passport application","I applied to have only my gender marker changed (using a DS-11) because I wouldn't have sufficient ID evidence in new name before January, and received my passport with updated gender marker.

The DS-5504 form states that you can use it if:

You changed name less than one year since your most recent U.S. passport book and/or U.S. passport card was issued.

**AND**

Your U.S. passport book and/or U.S. passport card is less than one year old.

I thought, ""yes, [negative duration] is less than a year, and the automatic form filler gives me a DS-5504, so I'll file a DS-5504 to get my name updated."" It was rejected because my name change happened *before* my most recent passport, with a letter saying I needed to file another DS-11, complete with sufficient ID in new name. I'm out overnight mailing both ways and expedite fees (nonrefundable) with nothing to show for it.

If you have sufficient ID evidence in new name, and your name change happened before, but was not reflected on, your most recent passport, please consider sending a DS-11 instead."
hanjanss,asktransgender,What was your experience on HRT while working a very public job?,"Title says it all I suppose, I was hoping to hear from some of y'all what life was like once you started seeing notable changes on HRT while working in jobs that required a lot of public interaction? I have a pretty close group of online friends that we all share advice but strangely all of them work from home or have very isolated jobs, whereas I'm a mail carrier and am very worried about transitioning 'out in front of everyone' as I told my therapist.

I have already done the hard work mentally of deciding this is what I want, it's worth the risk, my family will come around, etc but I have very bad social anxiety and already going to knock on doors for signatures is very stressful, pre-everything. My town is small-ish and generally pretty liberal leaning for a blue collar sea coast town but that hasn't done much to quiet my fears.

Is it normal to be way more worried about the strangers in my life than the people close to me?"
ziggyjuan,asktransgender,I guess I am trans indeed.,"Just that. I'm 23 and I've never had sex with anybody and I thought that I just needed to experience sex with a woman but here I am, crying alone in my bed for not being myself a woman. I'm male and the fact that I seriously want to transition without ever had sex just made me noticed that I am transgender . It's overwhelming. Just awful."
mrkrule,asktransgender,How did you know you picked the right name?,I still go by my given name. I know most trans people change their name at some point but I can't imagine being called anything else even if I don't always like my name. I've thought of changing it to a more gender neutral spelling and I have a list of names I kind of like but everything feels so forced and unnatural I couldn't even bring myself to ask other people to use it. I know a lot of times you just have to get used to a new name but how do you know when it's worth sticking with?
helloworld1989,asktransgender,How do those who view being transgender as a mental delusion and illness think we should be helped?,"So like an idiot I found myself reading and watching presentations from some of the most anti-trans advocates. I do this sometimes to try and better understand what many in this country and the world feel about those who identify as trans and how i can build a defense for when I tell my family. Who by the way are big fans of Milo and Ben shapiro. Everyone always brings up the idea that those who transition suffer higher if not the same suicide rate and what america is doing is feeding a illness that is helping mentally ill individuals kill themselves. Then they go on about how science is on there side, so on and so on. in most everything I have seen, the speaker always makes the point that the transgender community is making the wrong choice and we should be seeking help, because everything the ""media"" is telling us will kill us. 

So here is my question. What is the help they are suggesting? Everyone who is anti-trans is always talking about how we can easily be cured with ""treatment"". What is the Treatment? I love this argument, because I am sure many of us would love a magic pill that makes you okay with your birth sex, but that is just not going to happen. We already surround ourselves with therapists, so I cant see that as being what is being suggested.

Any thoughts on this? or ways to combat allegations that we are simply mentally ill narcissists who want attention? "
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Random thoughts about whether or not to get SRS,"Having a vagina would be nice.  I'm jealous of women who have vaginas, and sometimes feel sadness at seeing them.  My penis doesn't give me a whole lot of dysphoria (I can look at it and use it and feel pleasure from it), but the thought of being able to wear panties and have them fit correctly, and look down and see a vagina on my body, that feels like it would be preferable.  I feel like having a vagina would result in me feeling gender euphoria, though obviously I can't really know for sure without having had it done.

What gives me pause? Lack of a good amount of genital dysphoria.  The trans women I've known who've had SRS so far often have a common narrative: ""I had genital dysphoria before.  I couldn't look at it.  I didn't want to use it.  I made a beeline for the SRS as fast as I could"".  Fears of regret.  Simple inertia.  I have genitals already.  They work and are proven.  A neovagina might work less well.  Short-term transitional issues: about $20k to fly to Dr. Suporn to get the vagina installed, probably about half a year until it's burned in, lots of dilating.  The discomfort of going through surgery.

Despite those misgivings, I feel like if I had a button I could push that would give me a cisgender woman's vagina, I would push it instantly.  If Dr. Suporn showed up out of thin air and was like ""Hi everybody! Say, anybody want a sex change?"" I would probably be like ""Ooh, ooh, me, me!"" and put aside my misgivings and get it done.

I have years to think it over.  Hopefully to reduce the chance of regret.  It seems like a nearly impossible decision.  I feel like I've been thrown back to the same uncertainty I felt when I was contemplating transitioning in the first place.  How does a person who's not deeply genitally dysphoric decide whether to get SRS or not? Such conflict.  I find feminine women with vaginas beautiful.  Do I find women who are equally feminine but have penises instead to be any less beautiful? No.

Perhaps I'm being hasty.  I've only been seriously considering getting SRS since election night, 3 months ago.  The election returns had just come in, and I was agonizing over whether or not to get an orchie, not SRS.  Fearing the worst, that I would be unable to get health insurance due to pre-existing conditions after the ACA is repealed and replaced, I immediately reached out to my doctor, telling her that I wanted to start getting the ball rolling to have an orchie, fearing that in a few months, it would no longer be entirely my decision, and I might have to pay for it all out of pocket.  Basically, the fear that I had once felt about getting an orchie was now replaced by fear of being unable to get an orchie.  I guess it's similar to how a bunch of cisgender women rushed to get IUDs while they were still covered under the ACA.

Then my thoughts evolved.  If I was no longer afraid of getting an orchie, had my feelings changed regarding getting SRS as well? They had.  I was no longer deeply opposed to it.  I now felt a bit jealous of women who had vaginas, and wished I had one as well.  In light of this, I put aside my plans to get an orchie.

When I think about having SRS, and dilating afterwards, how do I think I would feel about that? I think happiness.  Not at the dilating, certainly; I know from other trans women that it can be a right pain in the ass.  Happiness like ""look what I have"", I guess.  Are these true feelings, or am I just overly impressionable, and have taken to heart what my more genitally dysphoric friends say about SRS? I guess I'll find out when I think about it more.  June 29th, 2018 will be 3 my year anniversary of starting hormones.  Perhaps I'll have a clearer sense by then of what I want."
TransGalacticOzone,asktransgender,I want a boyfriend,"I am feeling like I am going to burst.

I want a straight boyfriend. Someone who will love me. Who will hold me, make love to me, and want to be around me. Someone who will love my girlcock. I want a boyfriend who will talk with me and listen to my interests for hours. I can't even develop those interests I am so lonely and dysphoric.

I am not a gay man. I am a bisexual woman, pre hrt transwoman who really wants to be loved by a sweet straight man.

throwaway207291,asktransgender,What's stopping me from taking the next step?,"I'll try to keep this relatively short. I know I'm transgender and have known for years. I'm turning 20 soon and I don't want to wait any longer to start my transition, yet I can't seem to get myself to move forward. I've been lingering on making an appointment with a gender therapist for months now but every time I get close, I end up going backwards. I feel no obligation to come out to my family but I know that's unrealistic and unless I cut them off completely I'll have to say something at some point. But right now, this is about me and what I want. I'm thinking in terms of tomorrow and it still seems so far fetched. I want to talk to someone about this, finally, after keeping it inside for so long. I guess what I'm asking for here is some encouragement because it's my only option and whether it happens tomorrow or 10 years from now, I know what has to be done for me to live my life for real. "
broken-neurons,asktransgender,Dr Bart van de Ven - 2pass clinic - an open letter,"Yesterday someone posted [Warning: patient convicted for defamation bashing Dr Bart van de Ven](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5tlri3/warning_patient_convicted_for_defamation_bashing/) on this subreddit. 

Whilst the content and user appear to have been deleted, it appeared to be someone representing the surgeon himself. It received a fair amount of backlash from our users, as it openly discussed a patient who was unhappy about the results of their treatment and discussed the allegedly threats that had been made by that user to the surgeon and his family. If true then the patient was utterly wrong to do so, but similarly unprofessional appeared to be the post content from the person purporting to be the doctor himself, although as this is an anonymous forum, we have no way of checking. Though I assume that is why the content of the post is now deleted. 

Someone purporting to be [Dr Bart](/u/DrBartBelgium) has now posted [Person with different accounts on Reddit makes it her life to destroy Dr Bart van de Ven](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5tscn0/person_with_different_accounts_on_reddit_makes_it/), (which is oddly written in the third person), but raises awareness that he is being targeted by a user of this subreddit. 

As a user of this subreddit I find it **wholly appropriate** that he inform us of such attacks on his character that are unjust, especially when users are posting information that is defamatory and he wishes to protect his interests. Furthermore, his participation of this forum should be encouraged, since as a specialist in FFS he can give users the benefit of his knowledge and experience. However if he wishes to do so, he should note that there is a fine line between giving help and advice and advertising your own services.

**Anyway, I digress. I have no vested interest in that squabble, but something related is bothering me. Since it was noted in the original post from yesterday that he is litigious, I'll be quite specific - I do not imply directly or indirectly anything defamatory - it is merely investigatory and I welcome their feedback.**

As a bit of a backstory, I myself made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5tlri3/warning_patient_convicted_for_defamation_bashing/ddnnwug/) on that post yesterday about the reviews from patients who recommend this surgeon, as I had noted they seemed to be formulaic and I found it odd that they were all so similar. There was a [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5tlri3/warning_patient_convicted_for_defamation_bashing/ddopkds/) to my comment from one of his patients who defended their review as honest and without encouragement from the clinic, which I respect.

My intention here is to raise awareness of the reviews that have been posted to date. I have been an active user of this sub for some time so I've seen most of them over time. Here is the full list of reviews related to this surgeon on this subreddit:

- [FFS by Dr. Bart van de Ven - best decision ever made!](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4q2fkk/ffs_by_dr_bart_van_de_ven_best_decision_ever_made/)  by /u/neraje (regular asktg user)

I do not doubt that these posts are from real patients of the clinic and many have stated that they have posted these reviews in good faith. However many of these users have only posted on this subreddit solely for the express purposes of posting their review of this clinic (see their post and comment histories).

As a comparison of a similar clinic, here's the literally the only patient review I could find for Facial Team:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3c8y0a/i_had_ffs_50_days_ago_is_my_face_still_going_to/

The user /u/2passduck (who works as the patient coordinator for the clinic) has already stated that these are not paid advertisements, nor have the patients received any discounts for writing a review. 

However, I'd like to know:

* Are patients are encouraged to write about their experiences at the clinic?, and if so
* Are they guided as to the subject matter? 
* Do patients receive a questionnaire that they are encouraged to fill in post operative care?, and if so
* Are they asked whether the content of which can be used for publicity reason, and if so
* Is any of the content of those questionnaires used on this sub? 

If this is all above board, then why do many of these reviews seem formulaic? Every time I read one of these reviews, something seems off. I don't seem to be the only person that has noticed, since others have commented about the 'copypaste' feel of these reviews. 

/u/DrBartBelgium has already noted that reviews are encouraged. He [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4r6gk0/my_facial_feminisation_surgery_with_dr_bart_van/d4z1cfe/) in respect of the [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4r6gk0/my_facial_feminisation_surgery_with_dr_bart_van/):

&gt; Indeed we ask our patients to write a review so others that are looking for FFS know our work. Anything wrong with that? There's a distinct difference between a review written by a patient and an advert written by a doctor's organisation. This is a review. Any doubts about that?

[and](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4r6gk0/my_facial_feminisation_surgery_with_dr_bart_van/d4z30j2/):

&gt; Forums are full of reviews, positive and negative. Freedom of speech I would say. People can do with it whatever they want. And a review written by a happy patient still is a review, not an advert. There are also doctors that write reviews themselves, true. These are adverts. But we never have done that and never will. You want to know one of the reasons why? We don't need it. Patients already write excellent reviews about us.

I may be completely wrong, but I welcome others to give their own opinions. Like I said, I might be reading to much into this, but it's been bugging me for a while. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but something grates when I read these reviews. Am I just being stupid and over suspicious? I would go as far as to say that I was actively interested in pursuing surgery at this clinic, but these reviews have actually put me off, simply because my feeling about these reviews has led to a lack of trust, that may well be unfounded. I find that disappointing, since there are so few good European options for FFS.

**I don't want this forum to be used as an advertising board for the solicitation of services to trans people. I do welcome AMAs and advice from qualified persons who can add value to this sub, not cheapen it. What do other people think? Are these kind of reviews welcome here?**

@Mods, if you feel that this post is not appropriate for this sub (breaking rule 4) then let me know and I'll delete it."

For those of you trans guys who are into men, how has dating gay men been? Do you find it difficult to find guys who are okay with you not having a penis? Or do most seem okay with it?

peofun1,asktransgender,Can a transgender woman get someone pregnant? Is there a high risk of infertility on estrogen?,"(not sure if NSFW? Talking about reproduction so :/)

My girlfriend (22, almost 23yo) is going to be starting estrogen within the month to start transitioning. However, when she saw a doctor about it yesterday, the doctor said there was a chance that on estrogen she may have difficulty maintaining an erection, and she may permanently lose the ability to produce mature sperm. This is problematic because we both wanted to have children together eventually. 

So how high are the chances of estrogen affecting her reproductive abilities? Are we talking a 0.01% chance that they legally have to mention just in case? Or is it a high enough probability that we should start looking into sperm banks and other such options? 

I love my girlfriend dearly and I want her to be comfortable in her own body, but this is the first time either of us have had any doubts about her transitioning. I don't want there to be any regrets or any irreversible complications. Any advice, perhaps from other transwomen with children, is really appreciated!"
fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,"I keep going from suicidal to competely fine, it's annoying the fuck out of me","It's 4:37am at the time of writing this, and I've has pretty bad suicidal thoughts, but around 12am I was completely fine. 



I literally see no point in living, in life or anything.  I want to transition, but it's impossible without money, support or anything at all.  In the UK its either go private (which is expensive) or wait years on end for the free (NHS) health care. 



I don't give a shit about sixth form, my a levels, future careers, all I care about in life is transitioning (or lack of). I've pretty much been told that I'm going to be kicked out soon, but I don't care anyway. 



All I do is sleep nowadays, I don't care about anything else. I start sixth form at 9am, most days I only have 2 lessons so I finish at 11am, I come home and go back to sleep until 6pm. All I do at the weekends is sleep. I skip lessons, I've not even completed anything since I started, and I'm pretty much guaranteed to fail anyway. 


If I don't get to transition in the next year or so I doubt I will be alive this time next year. 



The trouble is that knowing its possible to transition, but knowing I can't is what's causing these thoughts. If I can't transition, why live? I've been pretending to be a cis guy for too long now. I've been lying to everyone, my parents and teachers ask what's up with me, I've been telling them I'm completely fine, but in reality I'm not. I don't want to upset anyone. 



I'm just considering DIYing it, I don't care if it's bad for me. I might be able to get the money to do it for a few months, but that's it. But that means I won't be able to have kids in the future. 





What the fuck am I supposed to do? Just end it all? That honesty seems the best option.

Throwaway74089,asktransgender,MTF Sterility?,"Hi all,


Just having read this article (http://www.milkjunkies.net/2013/05/trans-women-and-breastfeeding-personal.html) elsewhere on this sub, I was very surprised and excited that this woman was able to regain her fertility by laying off of HRT for 6 months. I'm young and I want my own kids someday, but I don't think I'll be able to pay for sperm banking before I begin HRT. 


Has anyone had success regaining their fertility despite a significant amount of time on HRT? Or, on the other side of the coin, has anyone been made absolutely and definitely sterile despite taking an extended break from HRT to try to regain their fertility?


I know many of us transition and don't look back so I'm not sure how many of you wonderful men and women will have an answer, but thank you all in advance anyway :)"
vegan-chickn-tendies,asktransgender,Confused and need help..,"Hey everyone, I'm 26m and I've been having some confusing feelings I hope I can get your perspective on.  

Up until fairly recently, I've felt fairly comfortable in my sex/gender, or at least didn't think about things so much.  I started dating a girl around 4 months ago and we totally fell in love.  My girlfriend enjoys being submissive in bed, getting dominated basically.  Prior to me, she had done some light slapping, but I have pushed her and embraced my own dominance fetish through heavy slapping and choking, which she loves and it makes us extremely sexually intimate.  We are both pretty horny, typically have sex or oral 3-4 times a day.

The problem is that when I started doing this, I began getting strong negative thoughts.  Initially, I treated it as a value thing, like ""is it 'slutty' or 'bad' or 'dirty' to want to be hurt or degraded""?  But upon further thought...I realized it was jealousy.  I wanted to be dominated too and I felt like I couldn't be.  Basically, I want to be able to suck a dick and get slapped around, but in my fantasies I am in a female body.  I almost feel like I am 'pretending' in a male body when it comes to submission.

To try and solve this, I wanted to role-reverse, but when she slapped me or said anything degrading I got extremely strong negative feelings.  Almost to the point of being infuriated and broken.  I felt like I can't really be submissive in a male body.  Like it's actually degrading because I am the ""man"" and she is female..like we are just pretending and I'm not in the right body to enjoy it like she does.

And don't get me wrong, I enjoy my masculine dominant side as well....it's just that I want both.  In my ideal world, I imagine myself and everyone else as the same sex.  Everyone has both a dick and vagina, just one sex..no dimorphism.

I have been into dicks on women since I was 20, but never really gave it a second thought.

There is also another experience.  When I was 21, my past girlfriend bought thongs and it upset me.  Again, I initially jumped to some idea of a value system, like ""thongs are slutty, I don't like them"".  But what was actually happening was that I was jealous.  I wanted to express my sexuality in that way and felt I couldn't as a man.

A month ago, I tried on a pair of my gf's panties, and it felt amazing and weird at the same time.  It just felt ""right"".  I immediately bought a bunch of male thongs and I love how I feel in them.  I don't feel near as good when I am wearing normal boxer-briefs.

I also have been shaving body hair off for a long time, and more recently, lasering it.  I am at the point where I am not comfortable with any body hair.


I know this has all been confusing, but....what the fuck is wrong with me?  I honestly don't know what I am, and I have a strong gender-envy, especially relating to my gf at times.  I actually do enjoy my male form to an extent--for example, I love my dick so much.  I also don't have any desire for things like makeup or whatever.  But I do get jealous of the ability of women to express themselves in different ways sexually.  For example, I feel like I'm sexually promiscuous at heart, but coming from the female perspective.  Like I want to be a slut, but I feel like I can't as a man.  Expressing myself sexually by doing things like wearing thongs makes me feel really good.  Lasering off all my body hair feels awesome.  I wish I was smaller and the same size as everyone else, so I could dominate and be submissive both.  Sometimes the dom/sub play with my gf activates this jealousy in me and makes me feel really frustrated and sad because it brings the gender asymmetry to the surface.

What am I?  Have you all felt like this before?  Am I alone?  How can I come to equilibrium with my sexuality?

galluccinator,asktransgender,Accepted myself as trans! :) Some questions on getting started,"Hello!

Over the past few weeks I have finally come to terms with my dysphoria and want to begin taking steps to become a transgender woman (SO excited!!). That being said, I figured I'd post here because I have a few random questions on getting started (ive been reading tons so I know most of the beginner stuff):

1) What doctor do I go to to begin harmone therapy? I see doctors in my area that specialize in harmone balancing, but the adds look like it's primarily for cis-gender harmone issues. Is that the best place to go to begin transgender harmone therapy?

2) How do trans women generally grow out their hair? Is it just something you have to bite the bullet with and accept you will look stupid for a while before actually being able to style it like a girl, or are there 'intermediate haircuts' you can get at different stages that make the hair growth transition a little less awkward? Can I visit a womans' hairstylist and get advice on what hairstyle would suit me best to maybe look for wigs in the meantime?"

One thing I'm most concerned is the bathroom use. I found that in 2015, they made it illegal for us to use the bathroom of our gender identity. Is it still the case state wide?? Would I have to reserve myself from drinking water?

Thank you."
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,At what point has HRT done all it can for your face?,"I've been on HRT for nearly 20 months now, and while I have passing female facial features (I've been passing for the past 13 months), they are more tenuous than I would like.  In my view, they're dependent upon me having medium to long hair and sometimes upon smiling.  If I tie my hair back, or focus on the bottom or sides of my face, or forget to smile, then things start to break down, in my view.  It feels like my facial features haven't changed all that much since I started HRT, but other things, such as removal of facial hair and having longer hair, have helped me pass.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/fQmFM) are pictures to show what I mean.

Is this pretty much the maximum amount of facial feminization I can expect from HRT alone? Should I be telling myself that if I want any further improvement, I'll have to look at FFS?

It would be nice if I looked like a girl even while not smiling and with short hair or tied back hair, from all angles, etc.

As a follow-up question, is there a good way to find out which FFS procedures would be beneficial in your case? I've given some thought to sending my pictures to an FFS surgeon and asking which procedures would be necessary to bring my facial features into the cisgender female range, but I worry that the profit motive might mean that they would recommend procedures which aren't actually necessary (for instance, recommending a tracheal shave when I don't have much of an Adam's apple) because it would generate more profit for their business."

rthayerf,asktransgender,Has anyone ever pretended they knew after they found out?,"I'm a college student who passes completely. Most of my close friends have no idea I'm transgender. I know because of what they say to me, assuming I have a vagina and talking about how ""it's so cool I played video games as a young girl"".

However, I have one trans friend who does know. I reached out to his mother to let her know that my Dad would be more than willing to talk to her, as I know it can be hard when your kid first comes out. She declined.

Anyway, I met my friend's father once. Later, while around my trans friend, the mother told the father I was transgender and he claimed he knew all along. Now I know this isn't true. Hell, his son's best friend is a cis girl who has a deeper voice than me, broader shoulders than me, and who is taller than me - and he wouldn't say she's trans. Like hell, even my trans friend didn't know and was surprised when I told him (and we can usually spot each other).

My friend knew he was lying too. When he asked how his dad ""knew"", the dad only said, ""Well she's really confident."" ...as if girls can't be? My friend says he thinks his dad doesn't want to accept that he couldn't tell a trans person was trans, because it invalidates his rhetoric of telling my friend that he'll ""never be a real guy.""

greatwhitenorthgirl,asktransgender,"Went to pick up my kids from my ex for the weekend, got called transphobic things by her mom (in front of the kids).","Still feeling shaken up by the whole ordeal...

My ex and I have been divorced for 5 years now (she had been having an affair and lying about credit card debt), and I get my kids every other weekend as per our agreement (and every Tuesday evening for a few hours).  I pulled into the driveway,  walked up and rang the bell to let the kids know I was there, and sat in my car and waited (like usual).

The double car garage door opened and my ex and her mother were standing there, with the kids standing off to the side.  (I knew right away my ex wanted a word with me and that she had her mom there as a witness).  

My ex has been trying to pin things on me lately (saying that my daughter (12) caught lice from my house and that my pasta sauce has been making her sick).  I told her I didn't appreciate the accusations she's been making lately, to which she acted like I had no right to be upset by these accusations (and proceeded to flip me off in front of our kids and walk back into the garage).  

At this point her mom walked out to the car.  As she was doing so, I rolled the window back up and hit 'voice recorder' on my phone.  She immediately became pissed off that I refused to talk to her, let alone look at her.  (My ex (now 35) has always let her mom fight her battles for her).

They don't know I'm trans, and I was (sitting in my car) wearing skinny jeans and a hoodie with no makeup.  Her mom started calling me the female version of my deadname to try to get a reaction out of me.  I just held up my phone so I could get a better recording of her voice (since the window was closed).  She then said 'Whatever you weirdo.  You freak...', and walked back to the garage.

I heard my ex tell her mom that I was recording, and then my ex walked back out to my car.  She started trying to apologize for her actions from a few moments earlier (I wasn't having any of it).  I calmly said  'I don't appreciate the discriminatory remarks and will be forwarding them onto my lawyer'.  She played dumb and said she never heard what her mom said.  I then added 'Are the kids coming with me or are you withholding them from me?'  

She let out a huff, walked back and whispered something to the kids before giving them hugs and letting them come with me.  Had a talk with my kids in the car and let them know that I wasn't upset with them for anything and they could always talk to me about anything.  

Just needed to vent.  My hands are still trembling.  I've never been harassed in public for being trans yet.  This is the first real negative incident that I've had to deal with.   Already emailed my therapist about the incident and will be contacting my lawyer Monday (since they're closed for the weekend now).  Going to talk to my kids about it more tomorrow...just letting nerves settle for tonight.   Anything else I should be doing?"
mrkrule,asktransgender,"Anyone else feel ""fake"" while closeted?","I've been questioning my gender for a long time, but I'm indefinitely closeted.

Is it normal to feel this way while closeted? How do you cope with a situation like this?"
olihoproh,asktransgender,Is it possible to use HRT to treat hirsutism in cis women?,"Hello beautiful people. 

I want to preface this by saying I feel a bit guilty asking about this, and I'm not seriously considering it. It feels wrong to me to suggest using the life saving treatment that you all depend on just to improve my own image and self esteem. I also know it's probably impractical. I'm just trying to fulfill my curiosity. 

All my post-puberty life, I've been cursed with a beard and mustache. As a cis women, this is not desirable to me. I've shaved, plucked, bleached, and nair-ed my neck every day since about 14. This has resulted in chemical burns, scarring, pimples, and 5 o'clock shadows. I'm fucking sick of it. I just want to go one day without being shy of my neck. I also have excess hair on my arms, legs, stomach, and back. Though I don't usually care about those, as arms are easily bleached and the only other person who regularly sees my tummy couldn't give less of a shit about the hair on it. My mom also has the same condition, if anything it's worse than my own. She has said it's because we're big, manly women with more than our fair share of testosterone. 

Now, here's where the trans community might have some input. I've noticed from many MtF transitions, that the beards/mustaches fade away into nothingness. Is this because of HRT? Or do MtF people still have to suffer with beard remnants and thus removals? Is there some other secrets you have? Any tips at all are extremely welcome. "
LoveIinus,asktransgender,Told this guy who like me that I'm transgender. Oh well.,"I was at work today. He was supposed to be here to check on me, making sure that I was doing my work properly. Anyway, he's very very good looking and charming. I was very shocked that he took interest in me. He said I was cute, good looking and stuff like that. He took me out during break time and he wanted to hold my hands and stuff like that. I like him but I knew it was never going to be possible once he knows that I'm trans. So I rejected him soooooo many times and he said ""do you know girls have never rejected me before"". Well maybe, since he is so good looking?

Anyways, I let him held my hand because it was my first real experience with a guy. 
He wanted a kiss, I allowed him to peck me but he tried to French me. I obviously stopped him but he was really interested I Guess??

He wanted to meet me tomorrow at my workplace again. He wanted to take this further and take me as her Girlfriend. That's when I decided that enough is enough. I told him that I'm interested in him but I don't deserve him. Why? He asked. I told him that I'm transgender. He couldn't believe it and wanted me to use my guy voice. I did. Then his reaction became a bit repulsive. He was constantly self reproaching and said ""what the f are you doing to me"". Then awhile later he said that he wanted to feel my dick just to make sure that I'm saying the truth. I didn't feel safe so obviously I did not. 

He started saying some hurtful stuff like, ""I swore I would only make out with girls"" then after that said things like ""obviously I acknowledge you as a girl but it just never happened in my life before."" Then said ""how am I going to kiss my future Wife while thinking about what I've just done?"" Anyways I was pretty sure that he wouldn't be interested in me anymore when he said, ""no, I still like you. It's just that this is so effed up and idk what I'm gonna do. Probably gonna bathe and think about what the eff I've just done."" Then he also said some nice things like ""I know this is not your choice, you look 100% female and sound 100% female and I'm never gonna think that you were born a guy."" 

Oh well. It didn't hurt me. I was quite well prepared for this. I liked him but I Guess guys are probably never going to like a trans girl like me. Oh well :&lt; "
Olivellagaylordi,asktransgender,Having trouble with the only therapist that can write a letter... Should I be worried?,"So in January I made an appointment at my college's counseling center, hoping to get a letter to start HRT. A few other transgender people had warned me that they don't write any kind of letters and have a huge problem with misgendering and using old names and just being a bit rude. I looked everywhere else but the few other therapist here want around $150 a session and 3-4 sessions. Since I'm broke as heck I sent an email and I was told that the center *might* make an exception for me and that they would do 3-4 sessions to see.


Right off the bat the therapist has said some things that have made me a little uncomfortable about meeting with her, but this is literally my only option to get a letter so I don't know what to do.

* She has said some things that make me think that she hasn't treated many trans people, but at the same time treats me as if I don't know anything about being transgender or hrt. 

* When I said I didn't want to date because I still look like a girl and didn't want anyone I date to think that of me later, she said that was just and excuse and was childish and that ""kids dont get to transition.""

* She then also pushed me very heavily on my sexuality and what I think about sexually. I didn't feel comfortable talking about that and I told her truthfully that I dont really have a preference and I avoid think anything sexual at all. (Due to bottom dysphoria, but I didn't say that because I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable) Next session she said she wants to go more indepth as to why I dont want to date since my reasons apparently are just a way to hide the fact that I'm afraid of rejection? 
 
* She also at each session makes sure to remind me that it's going to be a while before I get a letter. I told her how long I've know I'm trans and how long I've know that I need to transition. She said that she could tell that I had been unhappy like I am and have waited so long but said, ""What's 6 more months?"" 
    

Honestly at this point I feel so hopeless about therapy, and I really feel like a guinea pig for the center rather than a patient or visitor. I just feel like all my feelings and words are being twisted and like all of my problems are being played down. I'm really hoping next session things will clear up and we can move on, maybe this is just a weird misunderstanding?  Please tell me I can get through this."

Would splitting the dose make my levels higher in general but more consistent over the day? I can get my dose raised if needed but I am curious.

Galactic_SugarPunk,asktransgender,How do you tell the difference between doubt and your body giving you signs to stop? (HRT),"Hi everyone, first post!

So, here we go. I came out to myself as being transgender back in October, and I started hormones a month (and two days) ago. Things have been mostly good. Overall I feel my mood has improved, the decrease in sex drive has been GREAT, and I've been feeling pretty confident in general.

However, since starting HRT I've begun having some panic attacks. This is something I've never had to deal with before. This showed up around a week after I had started hormones, and it got bad enough that I went back to get a check-up with my HRT doctor after a few days (and then talked about the issue with my therapist). Basically it was determined that I was physically fine and was just psyching myself out, after which the panic-y feelings left and I was fine; until a few days ago when I started seeing/feeling some breast development.

This is something I thought I was eager to have happen/was excited about, but once it *actually* started happening I got kinda freaked out. The only other physical change that has started so far has been the decreased sex drive/slight genital shrinkage (which I'm still quite happy about).

I feel like I'm in a very weird spot, because while I have always been uncomfortable with the junk between my legs, I've never been *that* unhappy with the rest of my body, except maybe bits of my face. That said, I totally wasn't opposed to any of the other physical changes, or at least I thought I wasn't, but this boob issue has been really throwing me for a loop and has sort of thrown everything else into question.

Should I consider stopping HRT? Or is this just me psyching myself out again/my mind throwing a bunch of doubt on me? Have any of you (MTF or FTM) dealt with similar issues from HRT?


For the record, I haven't had much of a chance to talk to my therapist about this yet, since I can only afford to see him once a month (my next appointment isn't until the end of February). I also recently had my 1 month HRT check-up/blood work. However, I didn't mention anything to my doctor other than I was surprised at how quickly some things were starting. I'm on Spiro (100mg) and Estradiol (4mg) if that makes any difference.

TL;DR- Been on HRT for a month. Thought I was cool with the changes, but then starting growing boobs, got a little freaked out, and now I don't know what to do."

I always thought this wouldn't be an issue, since I thought I wanted bottom surgery but turns out, I'm pretty okay with having a dick and wanna see what it's to put it to use, so-to-speak. 

So basically, are there any methods you all can suggest for gettin' my mojo back? 

FWIW, I'm going to speak with my endo at my next appointment with him about this, since I'm sure I'm not the only trans woman he sees who's cool keeping her junk and using it. I just wanted to ask around, see if anyone knows some tips :)"
Reliable-Source,asktransgender,Transitioning and lonliness,"Hey all,

Not a question (lol), just sharing my feelings and wanting to hear other people's feelings and experiences.

So here I am, 31, 5 months into HRT. I'm at a point where people can see some changes in my face which is great. Things are starting to happen. I got gendered correctly for the first time by a 3 year old boy, bless his heart, even though I had a male tradie look going. My breasts are barely there but at the same time now quite noticeably there through my clothes. That's a thing now.

I want to share my experience with someone special though, but I'm all over the place. I don't feel ready.

I've done zero work on my voice because I don't know where to begin. I was planning on getting professional help with that but that has to wait until I'm working full time again because everything costs money. I've never worn makeup, so I'd be terrible at that, if only for awhile, even though it would help me pass. But even if I passed in my face, there is still my voice. My body, urgh. I'm in a normal weight range but closer to the overweight range than I'd like, when I'd rather be closer to the underweight range. But I want to eat EVERYTHING. And I don't want to calorie restrict because I'm worried undereating could cause developmental issues in regards to the HRT. Even if I look past my shoulders, height, hands, feet, there is my comically large adams apple. Then there is my hair, my god what do I do with my hair. I've had short hair my whole life and now it's barely touching my shoulders. It's too short to put into a ponytail because there is still quite a lot that won't make it. I just have to wait but in the meantime I barely know how to style it for work or anything remotely formal.

Then it comes to who I'd want to date. I've been with women 95% of my sexual partners and I really would love to have a boyfriend, but as a woman! I'm so unsure about this because it's unknown territory for me. I also feel sorry in advance for the first guy I'd date due to the unknown nature of how I'll feel.

So that's some of the main things troubling me now. As you can see I'm somewhat all over the place. I feel like half of this post is a rant but I also think that some of these problems are quite common for trans men and women, so it could be useful for other people to see that they're not the only one. Except for the few that have their shit together from day 1. Assholes :P"
MsStilettos,asktransgender,MtF Voicetraining harmful?,"I started voice training a year ago with online resources like DeepStealth with not very much success since my extremely deep voice was still dominating and it just sounded weird. I work as a lead developer on a software company and my day mostly consists of meetings and presentations where you talk a lot, and after some time into voice training I started to get problems with my voice up to the point where I almost lost it on long days. After that I consulted a few therapists and they found out that I already have some small nodules on my vocal chords from using my voice in an ""unnatural"" way and they recommended against continuing the voice training at least for a while to see if it gets better, which it did. After I stopped my voice training and tried to get back to my normal voice I don't have any problems anymore.

Does anyone else had similar problems with voice training?

I didn't feel anything, I just felt complete. The piece I've been looking for was just handed to me and everything made sense. 

But i felt like the biggest idiot because I always saw myself as a guy (I'm FtM) and I never thought anything about it. I knew I felt like a boy even as a kid and I knew that wasn't something everyone felt, but I never put myself down or thought it was wrong, It was just this feeling I never gave thought.

Everyday I felt like shit, i hated the way I looked, I was always uncomfortable with my body and tried to hide myself, and I would think to myself 'i hate being a girl' and just go through life like that. I never considered placing that feeling into this or in my life or into anything and I find that funny. I had the piece I've been looking for all along, I just never tried placing it in. Like when you can't find your phone and you're panicking, frantically looking for it until you realize you've been holding it all this time and just go 'oh' and laugh it off. 

I'm rambling and I'm sorry, this is just really bizarre experience, all my life I felt blank and empty now I've got all these doubts, hopes and so many emotions going through and I haven't even started hormones. I'm still a kid (not literally but still growing up ya know) and the road seems like a rough one yet I can still see everything I've always wanted within reach and I don't know what to think!! Man, I just feel so alive right now and I don't know why. 

Sorry for the long pos, I just wanted to get this off my mind for a bit. "
mjollnir82,asktransgender,"Before discovering being transgender, I always doubt/not sure of being who I was told to be. Anyone else?","I will detail a bit more: since child I was told I was a boy, which made me feel ""doubtful"". For years I kept looking at boys and adult men, trying to see myself. I got the sensation of not getting it, and when looking into the mirror, I would see a ""dumb"" and ""stupid"" boy (maybe something that had been said to me over and over again, as it may be normal in families/society, but that glued to me, due to my feelings/situation).
In addition to this, I always felt what today I call ""dysphoria"", i.e., a general sense of disgust and nausea, in the area of the stomach, and also feeling always ""sick"", never satisfied, about anything and anyone, and seeing the future as grey and heavy.
During puberty, I started to be bullied for stuttering, for being fat, for being ""dumb"". Also, that was about the time when I came to know the concepts of ""faggot"" and ""transvestite"". And I started run away from ""those things"". I started to be anxious. But the more I ran away, the more I got that sense of disgust and sickness.

I questioned myself about ""who I was"" all my life long. 
For a long period during my childhood I used to listen to people saying things about me, and asking to myself ""Is that me?"". I think that this is a normal period of life, but I was deeply doubtful, and I also was continuously feeling this general sense of disgust. I also didn't like my aspect, but that is too much generic as a thing, for me to say I had body dysphoria.

What I know is that I was very UNCERTAIN ABOUT MY FEELINGS, and I always FELT SICK.
I was also a kind of detached from the reality, and I was not living the things other people was living, I never had certain experiences, in terms of feelings. I felt stupid also for this.

In the constant doubt, I started with taking the good things that said to me, and then saying ""I am this"", without being sure and without knowing what to do with that. For instance, there was a quite long period in which when someone said ""you are a very kind boy"", or ""you like riding the bicycle!"", I started to say ""Hey! I am a kind boy, I like riding the bicycle!"", but I was not sure. 
I WAS NOT SURE about anything. Just not sure.
Eventually, as I grew up, things started to be more intense, I hit adolescence and it was painful: all my peers blooming, and I was still unsure and questioning. I then started to take parts of me and BUILD UP AN IMAGE that I and others could like, and that could protect me against humiliation. 
All this lasted until my 30s, and while it protected me, it also created me a lot of problems, including the fact that lots of people and peers started seeing me as a fraud and a stupid superficial person.
I said to myself ""be sure! Man up!"" and continued being ""coherent"" with the image I started presenting to others. But I felt I was only a big question mark, a big ""?"", and I feared someone could spot me (which happened, but I pretended I didn't hear/see anything).
I felt I was always at the ""bottom line"", a child, which didn't know who he was, which was in constant danger of humiliation, and need for protection.

Then, one day, I discover that I was watching at the wrong side, that I felt I was a female, not a male. And everything started changing. I FELT things, I FELT similar to others, and I started seeing myself.
I feel so dumb for having done all I did, for having said all I said, and, however I don't feel false any more (I felt false for a quite long period...) as I didn't know myself, I feel a completely different person, to the eyes of other people.
But that's it, amen, I cannot do anything for pleasing people...

Anyone else?"

stygianZinogre_,asktransgender,I'm so tired of all the waiting and uncertainty.,"I haven't been doing great when it comes to anxiety lately. And it doesn't seem to make much sense, since I've been a whole lot happier when it comes to how I look and feel. I'm mostly comfortable with my voice for the first time in my life, I'm actually starting to get some chest hair instead of it all just being on my gut and arms/legs/ass. And I've been trying to lose some weight for a while, nothing too extreme since I figured it'd be more effective in the long run to just stick to gradual changes that I can live with for the rest of my life. But still I've lost something like 8 lbs in the past month or so, and seen definite difference in distribution of the fat that still is there. I'm passing nearly all the time, even to strangers in situations where they've got paperwork or things still with my birth name. But much more important than that to me is that I've actually started passing to myself. Not all the time, but there's started to be times when I glance in a mirror and just see... myself. And it feels amazing. I was walking out of the bathroom earlier, holding something so my arm was raised in front of my chest and saw just the side profile of myself from hips/waist up, and just... I don't know how to put it in words. Just looked like *correct* normal proportioned regular average guy ***myself.*** Even though I could probably use a shower and definitely could use a haircut and was wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants and nothing else.

But I guess that's just it. If I'd moved my arm so it wasn't blocking my view of my chest then that image would have changed. And I hate that so much that it's even hard for me to type that sentence because I don't want to admit to myself what's still there, much less to anyone else. I'm so fucking tired of not being comfortable going outside without having a binder or several layers over my upper body or usually both. I'm even more fucking tired of not even being entirely comfortable sitting around in my own home wearing just a t-shirt. There's just always, *always* that tangible sensation. And that slight peripheral vision. I'm coming to realize that I don't just want surgery, I need surgery.

Maybe it's that thing where it's more noticeable because other things have improved so it feels so much worse by contrast. Or the fact that it feels so close, and yet so far. I could... well, I say I could ""deal with it"" or barely tolerate it, at least, since it seemed out of reach for a long time. Insurance had a blanket exclusion and I don't make enough money to be able to afford it for years, so I didn't torture myself by allowing myself to think about it. But then there was a court ruling in the state I live in that declared it unconstitutional to have that blanket ban. And I had a consultation with a surgeon. But no one can really seem to tell me whether it's actually covered, or if it's required to be covered when that will go into effect. They told me I should hear back if it's covered or not, but I haven't. 

I'm going to call and try to find out either tomorrow or the next day. (Does anyone happen to know, by the way, whether it'd be better to call the insurance coordinator at the surgeon's office, or someone at my insurance directly?) I probably should have called already but I'm terrified to. It's like schrodinger's cat right now, and sure, not knowing is anxiety-inducing. But when I find out, then either it'll be amazing news- **or,** it'll be the most soul-crushing news imaginable. I probably have nothing to be worried about, the surgeon said that everything was well documented, he had a copy of an article about the court decision, but also said that even before that, they'd gotten hesitant or unwilling insurance plans to cover it, so I'm just being stupid and delaying the possibility or even likely chance of amazingly good news because I'm so afraid of the possibility of disappointment. Although ""Disappointment"" doesn't even begin to describe it. Maybe it's not so stupid for me to be having problems with anxiety lately after all.

I'm just so tired of waiting, and feeling like my life hasn't even been able to start yet. Like I'm not ""done"" or ""complete"" or whatever. I hate that I even need surgery in the first place. I don't even like going to doctors or medical procedures, I hate that I don't have any choice, unless I want to go back to being a useless slug without any hope for the future, I'm always going to need that ""okay"" from doctors or insurance companies. I want to just be able to live a normal ordinary life and not have to worry about all of this anymore.

SadieRippedin2,asktransgender,Is this a bad problem to have? Confusions and concerns,"So, I've been working on my voice a lot in the past few weeks, a few hours per day. Today, while working on it, I don't hear much of a pitch/resonance change from when I talk normally.

I put my hand on my chest and my resonance isn't there, and when I record it, it sounds like when I was practicing last week, but it's low key throwing me off.

What's especially concerning me about all this is that I'm gonna be in the closet publicly for a little while longer and I don't know how my ""normal"" voice is gonna stay."
henx125,asktransgender,"Where I once never bothered to ""look"" at my body, I am now becoming hypercritical of it.","Before I realized and accepted that I was trans, I used to always look past myself in a way I'm sure many of you understand. I never really took the time to look at myself in any appreciable detail. 

However, since my epiphany, things have changed. I suppose that is the dysphoria finally coming about. But it really sucks. I used to rationalize with myself that I couldn't transition because I probably would always feel like a guy in a dress, but then I got to a point of not caring anymore and a point of hopefulness that made me think that maybe everything will be fine after I've fully transitioned. 

I've since gone to a therapist and got a letter of recommendation and have made an appointment with a doctor to get started with HRT. But the closer I get to starting it the more I feel like there are so many features of my body that I will never be able to see past, even if others can. I feel increasingly frustrated that I didn't have the maturity to accept myself earlier on so that I might have started transitioning before T made too much of a mark. I can't seem to stop finding new parts of my body I didn't used to notice or think were problems, and I'm so afraid that this trend will continue and that I will only become more uncomfortable with my body than I was before. 

So I don't know. I realize that it is only natural to feel fear at such a major turning point in my life but it is hard for me to really see myself becoming the girl I feel I should be. I feel like I have to at least try HRT to see where I can get, but at the same time part of me just feels like it would be safer to simply leave it at acceptance and not go any further than that. I mean for the most part I don't hate what I see in the mirror (except for when I try to see a girl), I just feel nothing. And maybe that is better than feeling dysphoria and having to deal with the outside world as well. 

But even then I know that isn't really an option, because probably, eventually, I'm going to get to a place where my dysphoria manifests itself in my everyday life, in a way that is harmful to my mental health and wellbeing. My mental state in regards to my gender come and go, but in an increasingly potent manner where the last time I experienced a low point I was driven to come out to my family and try to make steps towards transitioning; because I knew that I couldn't continue like that any longer."
trans_rights,asktransgender,Having issues with my Hormone Doctor,"Hey all! So I'm about to hit 10 months on hrt and I've been on the same dose since 3 months. My doctor increased me at the time to 4 mg estradiol and 100 mg spirolactone. Since then she has refused to increase my spiro, although she we are increasing my estrogen soon, once the prescription goes through. 

She claims that past 100 mg of spiro the benefits do not outweigh the risks. This wouldn't be so bad if when I was getting my levels checked they were constantly way too high for a female. My testosterone levels are 430 ng/dl as of several months ago and my estrogen levels are 669.8 pg/ml as of the same time. I have tried talking to her about how my T levels seem way to high and she says that there is nothing we can do about it and the only way to permanently bring it down is with an orchi. 

I don't know what to do, I know that I can get on a higher dose and lower my T but her refusal to do so is infuriating! Please help, am I wrong? Any advice?"

GAKBAG,asktransgender,MtF: Breast Growth,"So I'm a 23 MtF and I've been on 20 mL weekly Estrodial injections and 100 mg Spironolactone pills everyday, since September 11th, 2014. Early on, I did see a definite increase in breast tissue and breast growth. But it seems that after the first year my breasts growth has stagnated, because I haven't seen that much of an increase in size or definition. This is uncharacteristic of the women in both my immediate and extended family on both sides, as both my sister's and all of my cousins have defined busts. I am aware of how weird that sounds.

So my questions are; Is there something that I'm doing wrong? Is there something that I'm not doing or should do? Does my being overweight and being over 6 ft have an impact, or am I just being impatient? Do I need to talk to my endo about switching out or am I just going to need to have to just get a breast enhancement surgery? Maybe I'm just fated to be this way. Sorry to take up your time.

The problem is: I don´t pass quite yet, guess it´ll take a couple of months. So he´s asked me if I could get him a photo of me. I told him that I want to keep a certain distance for the moment which is true. But what if I would really like to get him know a little more? I mean, I´m in boy mode all the time. And I feel really guilty for not telling him I´m trans. I feel like such a huge liar... He seems to like me a lot and I´m not even honest with him. But if I tell him, I don´t want to lose him, he cheered me up so many times when I felt down, although he never knew why I felt down. He only knows that there are a couple of things in my life that are pretty painful.

I mean, if I´d only pass and I could get him a photo or so...
What would you do? I´m afraid of telling him.


UPDATE: I told him while having tears in my eyes. I started from the very beginning. He understood and was really cool about it. He said he doesn't mind and asked a lot of questions. After some time, we continued chatting like we used to. He still used the nicknames he gave me and everything was just like it used to be.

DreamsAndHonor,asktransgender,Please help. Hurt and lost in romantic relationship...,"I'm a twenty-three year old, pre-op and pre-testosterone trans boy.  I have been in a relationship with another trans guy for around three months now. I am very attached to him and have told him repeatedly that I am committed to him, adore him and value him. Yet I am feeling increasingly heartbroken as the days go on because he rarely contacts me anymore.  The majority of our conversations are through text, and I am always the one who calls him, even just to ask how he is doing and how his day is going. Although we live about twenty minutes apart he's told me he only has two hours every Thursday to devote to me, and no more, because of the demands of his weekly schedule, which includes taking five college classes (we are both attending the same college).

I'm a pianist and have composed songs for him. I have written poems for him. I have dedicated a novel to him. I make certain to tell him I love him every morning and every night. I care a lot about his overall wellbeing.

What hurts me deeply is that he tells me he wants to give me everything, but can't.  Last week he attempted to break up with me twice over text, two days in a row. I had to convince him to remain in the relationship. He brought up that I loved him too much, and that I was too emotionally sensitive of a person, and that those were both major issues for him that scared him. I had no idea they were issues until he told me about them then.

I told him how I'm emotionally sensitive, and he views that as a weakness and something that needs to be fixed. 

I told him how he is my first priority. He recently told me I'm not his first priority. That his work comes first and foremost.  He rarely texts me, doesn't tell me good morning sometimes and ignores certain things I take the time to write, such as my personal opinions on something or when I explain how a certain thing he's told me hurt my feelings.  When he does respond to when my feelings are hurt, he's told me that if I find him so inferior I ought to break up with him -- that if he was in my position, he would leave himself.  

His typical initial response to a conflict is to remark about the possibility of breaking up.  He has threatened breaking up with me weeks ago.  When I missed a bus to one of our dates I apologized profusely and told him how that would never happen again, and that I would get him a little gift for the next date to properly make up for things.  He threatened to break up with me for apologizing too much, because he took it as me acting too clingy and told me he's made too much progress on himself at this point to have to deal with me being so clingy all of the time and treating him as a sort of deity. 

He insults my intelligence at times, which I can understand, because he has been struggling with low self esteem for years.  So I don't take those insults personally.

I don't want to leave because I love him very much. He has bipolar type one disorder, along with anxiety and intimacy issues, and I want to be there with him through all of that.

I just want to be loved back with the same care, devotion and amount that I've been showing him since we first met.

I have been crying over this relationship lately, giving it a lot of thought, and confiding in my friends for emotional support. I feel it's become very one-sided and I want to know what I ought to do. How to proceed so that our relationship is stronger and healthier. I have been providing him with a lot of distance and have been working on and focusing on myself ever since he attempted the break ups.  He was the one who initiated the relationship.  He was the one who wanted to get romantically involved with me in the first place.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I just want to be happy with someone who loves me as I love them. Because I'm a trans guy I am so afraid that I'll never find that.  Not if I leave him.  Am I the issue?  Am I being too sensitive, am I overthinking all of this? "

PennyLisa,asktransgender,Gradually increasing genital dysporia. I hope this doesn't end how I think it might. [NSFW],"So when I started transitioning, I didn't really care much about genitals. Still had a sex-drive, some sexual hangups, but nothing too bad.

I'm now finding sex almost impossible. It kinda grosses me out to do PIV and while I can still do it I don't think for much longer. It's annoying because my wife doesn't really like me going down on her or touching her down there because probably similar stuff. 

I still love affection and we're very affectionate. She says she's not bothered by the sexual stuff, but I do worry about it coming to be a problem in the long term.

I'd love to be 'right' down there, just for... completeness I guess? I've got no interest in dudes or really anyone else except my wife, and I'd be quite happy being asexual as long as that was OK with her. I'd take a magic pill. However the whole process of SRS and dilating and the risk of complications and all that is just way more intimidating than the minor dysphoria about genitals.  I don't think my wife would be very keen on a vagina anyhow, and if I got my sex-drive back that could get frustrating.

Anyhow I guess my question is: Have you had anything similar? Did you go on to get SRS? Do you just deal with it? 

I just hope it doesn't gradually get worse.

Hmm... there sure doesn't seem to be many posters saying ""Yeh, felt this a bit but I dealt with it"". Someone? Anyone?"

madi3799,asktransgender,Roller Coaster of a Week / Just Came Out to Mom (sort of),"Hello everyone. This last week or so has been an absolute roller coaster for me. It all started February 2nd when I had my first extremely open conversation with my therapist about my m2f crossdressing. It was also the first time anyone else has seen a picture of me dressed. When she saw it, she commented how pretty I looked. For some reason that really touched me deeply: I came out of that appointment absolutely glowing and feeling the happiest I've felt in a long time. 

The following day I was already scheduled to visit a close friend. I was already toying with the idea of telling her, and after such a marvelous therapist appointment I became determined to tell her. This went wonderfully as well: she was so incredibly supportive and thankful that I trusted her enough to talk with her. 

Fast forward now through a week heavy introspection and increased obsession with wanting to dress. Thursday rolls along, and this is when things start getting real: I had the opportunity to dress for a rather extended period of time. When I'm finally forced to take it all off, I have major ""ah-ha"" moment in the shower. I just started reflecting on all the things I've been through in my life. Suddenly, it starts to hit me that this all would make prefect sense if I'm internally not male. That's when I broke down and realized that this was likely the truth. I just couldn't believe that something actually could explain all the years of fighting with depression and anxiety, hating the way I look, despising my voice (with a passion), feeling socially like an alien, and having internal conflict because my body movements didn't feel ""right"". I'll never forget texting my friend and saying ""holy crap! My body is the wrong gender!!! How did this happen???"" After making this realization, there's no way I can ever see life the same way. 

Fortunately, I already had another therapist appointment set for the next day. I went in absolutely elated that I'd had my revelation. I proceeded to recount it to her. And this is where I can use some advice... my therapist is really good at listening and helping me stay grounded, but she doesn't give much feedback. I was looking for an opinion on what my next move should be, yet the response I got was just kind of ""stay the course. Don't do anything rash. We'll figure everything out in time."" I'm fed up with this approach! I've let too much of my life be defined by indecision. I'm not about to let this happen again, especially with a potential solution staring me in the face. I owe it to myself to at least explore the options. Furthermore, I know myself well: if I let a lot of time pass, I'll just start rationalizing all of this away and end up back in a miserable state. So, I really don't know what my next move should be. I've been with this therapist a long time and really trust her, but I don't feel like she's overly knowledgeable on gender issues. Is there a big difference between a common therapist and a gender therapist?

Anyway, on to the topic of my mother (this just happened today). First, a little bit of background: I grew up in an insanely fundamentalistic charismatic Christian home. With that in mind, the plan was to wait a few months for me to transfer to a 4 year university. Then, maybe tell my parents once I was out of the house. Well, maybe it's still an applicable plan for my father lol. She heard me breakdown in the shower earlier today and pleaded with me what was wrong. After many many tears and repeated reassurance that she love me no matter what, I finally mustered up enough courage to tell her. The only thing is that i spun the issue extremely delicately and was careful not to use any words with negative connotations (which meant not using the label Trans). I tried to paint the idea that ""I think there's a disconnect between the gender of my body and mind."" She was fairy sympathetic, but not entirely understanding. I tried to prove my point with things from my past. Unfortunately, her response was to counter this with reasons why I was normal (all of which I've internally debated extensively on). It just really hurt when she would say phrases that she didn't necessarily mean in a derogatory way. For example, I showed her a picture of me dressed -- I was overjoyed when she didn't recognize me and asked, ""who's that?"". Anyway, her response ended up being, ""I think you make a way more handsome boy than pretty girl."" I know she was trying to give me a compliment, but that really hurt. There were quite a few similar statements that kept happening... a ""Bruce"" Jenner comment even found it's way into the conversation.

In the end, I'm grateful that she was kind enough to make an attempt at understanding my addition. However, I don't feel that I relayed the full extent of the issue. She seems to have the impression that it's just something that can be ""fixed"" with prayer and a new therapist. The issue of any potential transition was only briefly mentioned. This is probably reflective of the fact that I'm insanely scared and apprehensive about the issue as well. The thought of permanently altering my body and being dependent on medications is daunting. Furthermore, I don't know how well a 6 foot tall, 23 year old body would transition or pass. I don't want to get stuck in a mixed form. Also, I don't know if I'm ready to take on being a potential target of discrimination and bigotry.

If you made it all the way through, thank you for reading. Any uplifting suggestions or comments are appreciated."
Hummdinger27,asktransgender,Thinking of my deadname makes my real name not feel real,"The vast majority of the time my chosen name is my name and I respond to it perfectly and don't question it, but whenever I think of my deadname, it feels more like my name than my chosen one. I changed my name over a year ago and I have changed it legally. Nobody ever calls me by my deadname anymore but every time I think of it, my chosen name stops feeling like my name.

It's not a huge thing but it really bugs me. Does this go away? I feel like it'll go away mostly but not completely, but I really want to hear other people's experiences around this."
m4r1j4v45cr1p7,asktransgender,"So, I need some life advice...","Alright, so... A little background.

I'm a 20 year old (21 in one week) transgender woman, currently attending college to get my degree in computer science (a passion of mine since a young age). I've been on hormone replacement therapy for about 1.5 years now, and while it has made me feel a bit better, I still find myself struggling to maintain a normal existence (attending classes, completing assignments, going to work, etc) due to overwhelming feelings of dysphoria.

I do see a counselor, but the only thing that ever really happens is open discussion of my feelings, so I never exactly sense any concrete progress after leaving the sessions. I'm also starting group this week (specifically one for trans folk), and am really looking forward to having the company, but even still, I find it a challenge just to wake up and trudge through life, given my constant pain.

So, on to the advice. I've basically realized that fat redistribution is not going to completely resolve the dysphoria that I have towards my body (specifically my face, which is my biggest source of gender discomfort) until I undergo significant FFS. However, being a college student, I'm not really in any reasonable financial position to afford this for at LEAST another 2+ years, and possibly more - but honestly, I really don't think I will be able to survive that long without it, especially while maintaining a good GPA (which is extremely important to me).

I do, however, have an amazing and wonderful best friend in Washington state (I live in Ohio) who would most likely let me stay at her house, nearly rent free, while I work towards saving money to afford the more expensive aspects of my transition. In order to do this, though, I would need to drop out.

So, I'm wondering what everyone thinks the best course of action would be. Should I grit my teeth and suffer through several more years of utter torture so that I can get my degree and proceed on with my life as planned, or should I prioritize my own mental well being and take a several year break to allow myself to transition more fully, and then return to school at a later time to finish my degree in a much happier, and more comfortable, state?

Sorry about the wall of text. **TL;DR I'm miserable and want to drop out to save money to afford FFS so that I can get on with my life without wanting to disappear forever. Wondering what everyone thinks of this idea.**

Thanks in advance for any and all opinions. &lt;3"
MonicaRising,asktransgender,The In-between phase...,"I'm 3 months HRT now. Aside from having LHR, my face isn't really any different. I've taken pictures every couple of weeks but I still don't really see any difference other than maybe the skin is softer. I don't expect that I would see anything different at 3 months. But this morning I just bought tickets for a stadium rock concert in May. That's another 3 months from now and at 6 months HRT what am I going to look like? I'm certainly not going to be passing yet. My hair still won't be grown out. It's going to be warm weather and I'll want to wear a t-shirt but I've already got breasts budding... Like, what have I set myself up for, ya know? I should be straight-up pumped for this concert but now my thoughts immediately turned to the hyper-masculine cis-dominated environment I will be in and am I even going to be able to enjoy myself? It's days like these that I F'ing hate being trans. I don't miss being miserable but a rock show was always a place I could just go and lose myself in the noise and the crowd and let loose. Now I'm already self conscious. Like a lot of us, I wish I could just fast forward a couple years and actually look like the woman I already am inside. This in-between business sucks.

Mamablueeyes,asktransgender,Question about pronoun usage?,"Hi Reddit community! This is my first post on this sub Reddit, so please be kind!

As a cisgender female I've always considered an ""ally"" but honestly I'm super uneducated about the trans community and gender issues. 
I have many questions, because I want to raise my 4 year old son to be supported and supportive also. I'll start with my most pressing question with some backstory:

My local Hospital has a provider whose gender is hard to distinguish. The first visit I did not know this employees name either. I have since found out the name but it is a gender neutral name. I have had to talk about the provider in a third person and am unclear on pronoun choice. 

For example: Employee: Did the other nurse give you your meds?
Me: Yes ""she"" did.

I felt bad using the pronoun she, when I didn't know if that was the appropriate choice. I also felt like it was offensive to question the employees gender too.

Of course, I don't even know if he/she IS trans in any way, this employee may just have a gender ambiguous look - but I figured this would be a good place to seek advice. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I appreciate the education!"

DysphoriaConfusion,asktransgender,"If you don't experience dysphoria, what makes you transgender?","To start with - I'm not trying to gate keep, and I'm not trying to troll. I'm trying to understand. I've been reading articles both pro and against for hours, and I'm coming up with no concrete answers, so I thought I would just ask.

I'm a trans person myself, FtM, a month on T and looking into surgery dates. For me dysphoria is intrinsically linked to how I experience my gender. I recognize the validity of nonbinary genders, including agender or genderfluid or any number of identities, and I understand that gender is a spectrum.

Looking at the definition of transgender, it's experiencing a disconnect between mental gender and physical sex, which can be corrected through transition. (""Trans""ition, hence ""trans""gender). Meanwhile, gender dysphoria is a state of unease with the assigned gender. Dysphoria can be crippling, or it can be background noise - what it looks like or feels like largely depends on the person. It can be either social or physical (or both).

So as I understand it, being transgender is wanting to transition because of dysphoria. No dysphoria, no transition, no transgender. 

Gender Identity and Gender Expression are separate entities. How a person feels and what they are is their identity. How they express that is their expression. Liking gendered clothes, hobbies, etc doesn't make someone trans or cis - it just makes them a person who likes those clothes or hobbies. Men can enjoy dresses and still be men. Women can enjoy hard core sports and still be women. No one disputes that, as far as I've seen. 

So someone who enjoys the dress, hobbies, etc that are associated with another gender but does not experience any discontent with being their gender or being seen as their gender - they're a non-stereotypical person, but that doesn't mean they are trans. Being upset that society won't let people enjoy the pastimes that belong in a separate gender's ""box"" is a product of sexism, and something that needs to be addressed and changed - but as far as I can tell, it's a separate issue from being transgender.

But as I said, I'm not trying to gate keep. I'm not trying to decide that people ""aren't trans enough"" because that's both stupid and harmful in a community that should be bound together for strength. I'm just trying to understand. If a person experiences no dysphoria, but still identifies as transgender, what makes them feel transgender? Doesn't that by definition mean they have no desire to transition, and are content with their current gender? What am I missing here, because I feel like it should be glaringly obvious. 

I am genuinely interested in hearing about other people's experiences with their gender, and how they have come to understand it now. And I do it from a place not trying to judge or police - if you say you're trans, I believe you. I just want to understand the other perspective."
I3oog,asktransgender,A bunch of questions for someone who has finally embraced herself.,"Actually this was the first time I have ever actually acknowledged myself as ""Herself"" in a written sentence. It is really hard to describe how I feel right now, but hopefully it is a sign I am on the right track because that makes me feel so good. Hopeful even.

I have sort of known this about myself about as far back as two years ago. I have been struggling with it since and have had mixed reactions among the few people I have told. I am posting this as a combination to get a few basic questions answered and also just to meet people to talk to. I am very nervous about everything, but I hope that I can make some steps towards making myself a happy person again.

A little background about myself: My name is Tim (I don't really have a female name or anything; at least as of right now) and I am a 26 year old general failure. I hold two bachelor degrees; one in music, the other in philosophy. Thusly I am super broke despite having multiple jobs. I have had a kind of rough life, but the worst has been the past few months since having been hit by a drunk driver and nearly killed. I have been teetering on being an alcoholic and drug addict since, but I am really trying to turn that around starting today.

I really fucking hate my body. I am so masculine with broad shoulders, rigid features, and I am very, very hairy. It sucks a lot. Every time I look in the mirror I wish that I could be the opposite of what I am (both in character and physical aspects). I am now very confident that I want to pursue an entire change in my identity, because I hope that it will make me comfortable and happy.

The following are some questions I had for you folks:

* Is it possible for me to actually change significantly enough to pass? I feel like I am so far away from it. I will attach a photo of myself right now at the end of this post in an edit.
* What steps should I take in order to begin everything? Including support groups, therapy, actual surgery, and the like.
* How much can I reasonably expect this to cost? I am very worried I won't be able to afford anything because I lack health insurance and high pay (plus I am in debt).
* What are simple changes I can make to prepare for the change? I know I need to change my diet and get more in shape. Are there mental exercises that can help? Will I need to do anything for my voice?
* How can I come out to people about this? I have told some of my closest and most open friends, but should I write letters or notes? Should I sit down and just confront people with the news?
* What can I do in order to ease my dysphoria and depression in the meantime? I tried cross dressing a lot about two years ago, but it just makes me feel like shit. I want to look pretty, but instead I am just a kinda fat hairy dude in women's clothing and it makes me want to throw up and die.
* I am moving back home to the Boston area at the end of March/beginning of April. Does anyone have advice for groups that may be able to help me or anything? Additionally, I am currently in Denver CO. Anything you could recommend for me for the rest of the month and a half I am here?
* What things can I do to help learn about makeup and hair styling and those things? I want to figure out what I should go for as I transition?
* Is it reaching too far to hope for an entire transition? I fucking hate having a penis so much. I really worry that I won't be able to get SRS ever, and if I do that it won't work.

There are so many questions I have, and I feel so weak and ignorant. I just want to know that things can get better and what I can do to make them happen. If you have any advice or questions of me that isn't relevant to the above I am very open to it. I could use all the help I can get. Thanks for your time

One of the main sources of this anxiety for me is the fact that I am chiefly attracted to women and I just worry about finding a life partner who I feel in love with and who accepts me.

I have met some people online who I like, but most of them live hours away and I doubt they have any interest in me. 

 I sometimes feel like I should just back out now and try somehow to make being a male work. Dating seems like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I worry that I am going to end up alone because I shut myself out of most of the dating pool just because of who I am.

askingforfriendnot,asktransgender,Trouble determining if I'm just attracted or actually want to be the opposite sex,"I'm sure you guys and gals get this question a lot. I hope you don't mind it being asked again.

My whole life I've struggled with anxiety and depression. I have a good transgender friend who said gender dysphoria is like wishing you had another body more than anything. I've never had that I think nor have I been much attracted to other cis-men, although someone like Ryan Gosling...

I digress. In video games I almost always play female characters. In a game like Overwatch I'll look at someone like Tracer and go ""I love her look."" I honestly wish I could cosplay that look, but it would look a bit silly as a cis-male.

In MMOs almost all my characters are women. I role play mostly as a woman. Even my first foray into role play, ten years ago in Garrys Mod, I role played a woman. That was back in high school. I'm still roleplaying women.

All the porn I look at is of cis women. I've never even looked up gay porn out of curiosity, so I'm pretty sure I'm straight. Although I do know a very attractive man when I see one on the street.

I'm asking if this is like an onset of being transgender? Does my depression and anxiety link back to that? I've always wondered what it would be like to be a girl, but it doesn't cross my mind at every waking moment like it does with my friend.

Am I just attracted to the women I play as, or is my desire to play a women a genuine onset of late gender dysphoria?

The general rule that I see around here is that cis people never think about being the opposite gender, or at least it isn't appealing to them as anything other than a curiosity. In the thread, it seems like quite a few people have a fantasy about being the opposite gender. Are these people all at least somewhat trans on the spectrum? 

One guy writes ""My fantasy can be summarized in ""i want to have a dick in my pussy"" but I don't have one, so it's kind of frustrating."" Well, he could have one if he transitioned, right?

There's an awful lot of ""my trans brothers and sisters"" going around and I suppose this is just a friendly reminder that there are a lot of trans folk who are gender neutral, who would be a sibling rather than a brother or a sister, and it's important for the trans community in particular to stand in solidarity with its nonbinary and genderqueer members, because that kind of solidarity and understanding can be difficult to come by amongst cis people/non LGBTQIA+ folks in general."

gaussmap,asktransgender,"I think I was a diversity hire, and I don't know how to feel about it.","Tldr at the bottom. I'm FTM. Throwaway because I'm about to give out a lot of personal info.

So I'm applying to summer undergraduate research programs in mathematics, and I got an offer from one of the most prestigious programs in the country. When I say prestigious, we're talking most of the students who get accepted to this program are Ivy League or pseudo-Ivy League students who go on to do graduate programs at Ivy League or pseudo-Ivy League schools. My info:

- I'm FTM. Legally female in all respects right now. My name has not been changed anywhere so I applied as [chosen name](Legal: [legal name]) on all of my documents.

- I am white.

- I go to a state school.

- My GPA is about a 3.83. From what I can tell, most students in this program are much closer to a 4.0.

- I am in an honors mathematics program which is VERY intense (material is the same as graduate level oftentimes). The program is small and not particularly well-known. I also have majors in statistics and actuarial science. Minor in German.

- I'm nearly done with my mathematics curriculum. (Can specify if there are mathematicians wondering which courses.) I've also done a lot in statistics, which is unusual for mathematicians, but seemed mostly irrelevant to this project.

- I have completed a graduate course in the field of the project I applied to work on, did well in it (4.0), and my professor wrote a (presumably very good) letter of recommendation for me.

- My other letter came from a math professor who I know well. I took a class with him that concluded in a research project (not original research, more report-style) and did well on the project and in the course. I also cat-sitted for him over the summer so he seems to think I'm a half-decent person.

- Honors: Several scholarships, including one recurring and a full-ride to the school I'm currently attending.

- I have been employed as a TA for an honors mathematics course.

The trans stuff: Both of my recommenders know I am trans. I asked them to use male pronouns on my letters and they both presumably complied; I also told them that they could comment on my trans status if they deem it relevant, as it has honestly gotten in the way of my academics in the past year and a half while coming out, starting hormones, and recently having top surgery. The school I'm applying to seems very progressive with LGBT issues and has very good policies regarding trans students, so I expect that the faculty there are at least minimally knowledgeable about it. One telling factor was that when I was contacted I was referred to by my chosen name only. After my personal statement (essay described notable parts of my mathematics education and no mention of my identity) I did include a statement that basically said:

- There are two names on everything because I am trans. Name will be legally changed by start of program. [relevant because these programs are basically paid jobs]

- I am legally female. [relevant because housing, and at some states/universities it's by legal sex] I can be housed with either sex at the program organizer's discretion.

- This has had a nontrivial effect on my education. Particularly, last semester (when I got a 3.0 in a pretty important math course) I was working towards independently scheduling and funding a major surgery which I had to pay for out of pocket. [did not specify what since it's not relevant] Due to recovery, I could not continue to work as a TA and am currently a part-time student. [I felt the latter especially needed justification; some programs only accept full-time undergrads]

- Please kindly take this into consideration when reviewing my application [basically ""I'm not lazy I just couldn't get out of bed sometimes because I felt too bad about my body to be seen in public and sometimes I cried instead of doing homework so please I'm sorry""]

The leader of the project I applied for emailed me five days after submitting my application (same day it was due) indicating that I was one of their top applicants. They wanted me to read the paper they worked on last year and give my thoughts. I did, including a part where I pointed out some flaws in one of the proofs later on in the paper. The reply I got was, ""Good response, thanks."" (Very terse guy I was talking with, so I think this was positive.) A few days later he emailed me an offer to be part of the program.

I accepted because I'm absolutely ecstatic about it. It's a great program, it's research in a field I enjoy and would like to do work in, and all around there's nothing not to like except that it's in the middle of nowhere, but I can get over that. However, a few friends of mine also applied to this program who have better grades than me in some of the same classes (although none had the grad course I did) and were not accepted. I also just feel like I'm way out of my league with all of the kids from fancy private schools.

I keep trying to think of a way I could have cheated my way into this position. Did I accidentally list false grades? Did I accidentally check the box that said I'm Hispanic? (These programs get funding from the NSF and are encouraged to accept disproportionate numbers of minority students.) Or am I just there because I'm trans, or because they can report me to the NSF as female? I didn't want to leave it out of my application because I think it provides important context to my academic history, but I didn't want it to become the reason I made it in. It's really messing with my head because I feel like I don't deserve the position I got.

Of course, I'm very grateful for the offer; I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. It's plain old self-doubt.

Tldr: I got into a very prestigious research program. I'm qualified, but not as qualified as I perceive other candidates to be, especially others who were accepted in the first round. I think it's because I'm a minority, and it's really messing with my head. Am I being dumb, or did I actually get this on my own merit?

I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences with stuff like this. Has this ever happened to you?"

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,How to get a job?,"Hi there :D

---

**TL;DR:** Presenting female, legally male. How to get job and flat? Need advice. Thanks!

---

Following situation: I'll finish high school in a few months, and after that I'm going to move away. Obviously I need a job at my new place. Starting the day I move out, I'm also going to be full-time. However, it will still take quite some time until I can transition legally. During that time, probably 6 to 18 months, I'm going to be a man in a dress, at least in a legal manner.

How should I go about that? When should I tell my possible future employer that I'm presenting female? What should I consider to not ruin my chances of getting hired entirely? Should I tell my colleagues?

The same with very similar issues is of course true for finding a flar as well! Thanks!"
poesii,asktransgender,What reading material do you have for my professor who wants to learn more?,"I'll take articles, good blog posts, research papers, books, etc. She's got a PhD, so she'll be able to wrap her head around more cerebral stuff if you've got it.

There's a professor at my school who is a very well meaning ally with a lot of very flawed understandings of what it means to be trans. She's teaching an Abnormal Psych class (which she's renamed Psychopharmacology to be a little less stigmatizing of the topics discussed) and has a unit on Gender Dysphoria. It sounds bad, I know, but I went and talked to her about it and she's doing a good job of trying to teach her students that it's really only in the DSM for insurance purposes. I'd like to get her a little bit more educated so that she's more effective at getting her students to understand better than they would with her current level of gender know-how.

She knows enough to seem well-versed and to be very supportive, but she very much buys into the ""born in the wrong body"" narrative and, as a psych professor, also relies heavily on the DSM's Gender Dysphoria entry and the experiences of the one or two trans clients she had in the past (at least one of whom was a very by-the-book ""always felt this way"" binary trans girl). 

She was surprised to hear that dysphoria is a concept/term that exists within the community (and in fact that that's where the term in the DSM even came from) and is having trouble wrapping her head around what it actually means. So far her understanding is this weird blend of dysphoria being caused by gender roles, people's parents treating them badly, and the ""wrong body"" thing. I did a decent job of explaining it to her, but I think it would help for her to read more on it. I'm sending her [""That was dysphoria?""](https://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/), but it would be great if people have other things too.

I also want to suggest that she read *Whipping Girl* by Julia Serano but haven't read it myself so I'm not sure what she'd get out of it? 

**TL;DR**, I have a professor who's like halfway to being a great ally and I want to get her all the way there. Talking to her worked to an extent, but I think reading things would help her more.

Things she's not getting:

* How the ""born in the wrong body"" narrative is not always right and can be harmful.

* How the DSM entry is not indicative of every trans experience.

* What dysphoria is and how varied it can be. 

* Nonbinary identities.

* Gender identity vs. gender roles. 

* How transition varies for literally everyone (in terms of wants and needs).

* Gatekeeping (ie. why trans people don't always trust psychologists)

* Probably a lot more stuff than that.

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies; I just don't have the time to go digging for stuff on my own on top of my schoolwork, and I know I've seen a lot of great resources floating around on here before. "
Dustman28,asktransgender,Just had Army Guard Trans Training,"So, in a surprise Officer Development Planning session my Commander broke out the fresh new PowerPoint to cover Transgender Soldiers transition. The whole unit will be covered tomorrow, so I will post again, but here is the gist of it.

1. As a volunteer professional army we are expecting to treat fellow Soldiers with dignity and respect. Promoting a safe environment for Transgender Soldiers improves unit readiness, quality and health. (They can't afford to kick us out due to backlash and they need every warm body)

2. All Soldiers must maintain Army standards, good order and discipline. (Both Trans and Cis need to get along and meet the regulations)

3. Transition is individualized to meet the needs of the Soldier. Once transition is complete, DEERS will be updated and THEN they meet the standards of their respective gender. (They can make exceptions for your transition, but you must maintain your current gender until the system is updated)

4. Transition is complete when you are stable in your preferred gender. (You and the medical board decide when that goal is ahead of time.)

5. The Soldier must identify as Transgender to thier chain of command, see the Military Medical Provider and follow the agreed treatment plan. The Commander WILL approve the updated gender marker once completed. (You do your part and they must approve the change)

6. Exceptions to Policy can be made to accommodate the transitioning Soldier.(PT waiver, bathroom privileges, uniform accommodations, quarters and assignments etc. Can be authorized if needed. This is at the Commander's digression and/or by your request)

This is the dumbed down version of a long presentation that flutters between being fairly accurate to poorly but innocently written. I say that since some examples were INTENDED to confuse people into judging on the side of caution. My Commander repeatedly warned that failure in preventing an EO complaint was a career ender for the officer that failed. I feel better and worse, partly because I always had the correct answer for the questions and almost outed myself too soon. 

I plan to come out soon anyway. Probably next drill depending on how tomorrow goes. There is even mention that the guard will pay for all the HRT treatments, FFS, and GRS if that is part of your plans. I will confirm that tomorrow, but if so then that would be the best way I can see transitioning in my current situation. The drawback is that your only accepted as your preferred gender once it's done and your transitioned.

So, a side poll I guess. Who thinks I should come out tomorrow and take one for the next Soldiers that speak up? I am interested since I want to come out before the Orange-and-Chief tries to reverse anything."
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Looks limiting personality,"I am 16 and this may sound weird but I obviously look masculine and have a masculine body as I have not been on female hormones yet, it just can't be feminine. But I kinda have a slutty/bitchy personality which is kinda like this [popular girl on Youtube and Twitch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFIF66saXQVxRiyckv820Q/featured) and this just doesn't work with the way I look at all (unattractive and masculine) but I actually act like this at home and around my only friend. I hate being limited to not being able to act like this in public as it makes me look weird when I have to completely act like a different person and fail at it, it looked weird when I was a boy and now I still look weird as I am so passive and don't talk much as faking my personality is hard. This is a big reason why I don't have friends anymore, the boys always tried to bring me into conversations so there was no problem with me being quiet but the girls leave me alone in the dirt if I don't talk alot which doesn't work with a fake personality.

The problem is that I have to look quite good to act like this without getting alot of hate (I would still get some hate from some girls as they won't like my personality). Because I am trans, I am not sure if I can ever achieve a body that is in someway this attractive that people would say ""Hey that girl is actually pretty hot"". I know these kind of girls wear alot of make-up and work out alot but is this possible for me? It really has to be because I don't want to spend my life like this, it's the living hell not being able to be who you want to be.

I initially started my blog [How I Met Your Brother](https://howimetyourbrotherblog.wordpress.com) to write my feelings about my boyfriend being an ftm transgender male.

FoggyDay_97,asktransgender,So Scared this is a Fetish! Help?!,"I first questioned my gender around the age of 11 but began to do so quite a bit since I was 16- I'm now 19. Although there were a couple of incidents pre 11 which stick out in my memory.

However, every time I question my gender over the past couple of years it nearly always leads to me getting aroused and masturbating.

What I do not know is if this is a coping method to deal with being trans or me just being a pervert; it terrifies me. I too watch, almost exclusively, transgendered porn. Even when I think about being a girl and doing normal stuff, like going to the bank, I get kinda aroused. In fact I masturbate a lot and I'm starting to think it's a coping method.

Did any of you guys ever feel like this? I just wish I could have a serious think about if I'm transgendered without wanting to jack off. I feel like a pervert and the guilt is really getting me down, if I am transgendered then I want to do something about it ASAP. But it's impossible for me to be honest with myself because I just seem to get aroused when I think about it and then when I do masturbate those feelings go away immediately.

Sorry if this post grossed anyone out, I feel embarrassed writing it. But I feel so confused, I almost want to be trans if that makes sense?

Thanks."
Atlsissy14,asktransgender,Can someone please give me some advice.,"So I've always had the desire to be a female but just recently I have been cross dressing and trying on make up and I really want to take hormones now. 
A huge part of me wants to transition and start doing porn where men just dominate me. But then the other part of me wants to find a wonderful woman and marry her and settle down and have kids. I obviously can't do both and I'm only getting older but I know this desire will be with me forever. Does anyone have any advice?"
Blairnatalie,asktransgender,Not nessesarely transgender related but..,"Morning, like the title says this isnt transgender related but i generally get the best answers from here.

Not sure if many of you remember but a few months back a girl and i went for a hike, had a blast etc etc. Well we both wanted to see where it would take us, and from my impression i thought it was headed in the direction of a relationship. She knows im trans and has no issues with it, shes totally cool with it. 

Anyways a few weeks back i asked what the deal was, she mentioned that she just wanted to stay friends for now and that she wasnt activley seeking a relationship which was fine, we still had each others company, we still cuddled a ton, along with the extra curricular activities (if you catch my drift, were also roomates now lol..). Anyways the other day she mentioned that shes going on a date with a guy we both know and better yet its on Valentines day. This guy is activley seeking to date her, and she knows this as well. I guess you can say im torn and i dont know what to do in order to move forward. I have alot of feelings for this girl, its insane and its really hurting me to hear these things.

Part of me is wanting to distance myself big time to avoid getting hurt more, its a defense mechanism for me to just shut people out. But a part of me does not want to do that at all. I want to be there for her, and i want our friendship to flourish into a relationship. She knows this, and shes said the same in the past. I do not want the friendship we currenty have to change for the worst as its pretty awesome. Were both there for each when we need it the most, its just when i mentioned these things in the past shes always taken a huge step back and thats a result i do not want.

I love my boobs (dispite the fur, which I hate) and it'd love then to be bigger, or at least more feminine in shape (or at least have my nipple not pointing at my feet)...I'm worried that if I go on hormones I'll have truly massive tits really fast and it'll all be too much.

LooseyLewd,asktransgender,"As a trans woman, why have I started getting pat downs at the airport EVERY time I fly since I've transitioned?","So, I don't travel a crazy amount, but I fly regularly enough to have noticed this..

So my question is: WTF?

Like, I have sort of a lot of genitals or whatever, but the machines never saw them as a security threat before. Plenty of boys walk through without their crotches triggering a pat down.. wtf is up? 

It's not like I'm being picked out by tsa agents. It's a goddamn machine.. does it like, see tits and just assume that the only reasonable thing there could be is a vagina between my legs? If that's the case, why are they programmed to be transphobic?

I'm just so confused.."
passionrascal,asktransgender,"I want to have sex with my penis while on HRT, is that possible?","So, I've read a lot of experiences w/ HRT effecting sex and sexual organs, but it seems like there's a lot of anecdotes and very little consensus on what happens on average. A lot of stories about how it shrinks the penis down to 50% or less of its pre-HRT size, a lot of stories where it doesn't do that. Et cetera. There's a story for every scenario and I'm left more confused now that I've read a lot, than when I'd read only a little.

I have a big dick and I like that fact, and I enjoy having penetrative sex with my wife with it, even as a woman. I don't have dysphoria about it, as in general my main drive with my trans experience has been overwhelming euphoria instead of dysphoria. I do have dysphoria, just not about my penis. I wouldn't mind it shrinking a little bit, though I'd guess the shrunken testicles are unavoidable. That might look a bit funny. But what I don't want is total inability to have penetrative sex. I'd still do HRT if that would be the case, but I'd honestly just rather keep functionality. I'm perfectly sure of my womanhood regardless of my desire to have a penis, and I'd rather not have people judge that. I'd also rather hear from people who feel at least a little bit like me, though all opinions and stories are appreciated.

So, I have a couple of questions I'd like answers to from somebody who's experienced enough to maybe give out a sort of consensus on a few questions. Scientific or medical journals discussing these topics would also be appreciated.

Is it possible to keep functionality the same if you use your penis routinely?

Is it possible to use viagra or somesuch medicine to help with functionality?

Do doctors think that not wanting to have SRS means you're not trans, hence leading to them not wanting to diagnose me? I live in Finland, where the diagnosis process is long and filled with doctors who might be wary of trans experiences like mine.

Thank you for your time!"
Aldawolf,asktransgender,really stressful situation,"So I've been trying to push for HRT as much as I can and I only have one clinic avaliable to me. And they need a psych or therapist approval. My psychiatrist are adjusting my medications because for some reason they think my gender identity is being caused by elevated prolactin levels/supressed T levels which are caused by a medication, or it has to do with ""Body image"" issues I had a while ago when I was trying to lose weight or something like that I don't fucking know. They also have asked if I had a significant other trying to push me into this. I've recognized my identity for 9 months straight now and I only came out about it 2 months ago to my psych. My psychs are being really fucking shitty about this and are getting a professional trans psychiatric consultant to meet with me but I've been feeling worse and worse everyday I'm stuck in this state of being denied hormones and it makes me feel so fucking shit, which contributes to an image of ""instability"" as I've been crying a bunch over this shit, with my transphobic parent not helping at all. I don't know what to fucking do. All this ""instability"" and descent into depression and anxiety began with my mom shitting on me when I first came out to her and I've been emotionally broken since. They keeps saying I can't start because I haven't ""handled the dissapointment well"" after being told no once what fucking horseshit. Worst part is a ""trans friendly"" therapist that was recommended to me by another trans person is going along with all this fucking bullshit"

About halfway through meeting with the SW today, she tells me the endo would like to speak with me after we were done. Popped back out to the waiting room for a few minutes, then in to meet with the endo again. Aaaaand I walked out with scripts for 100mg spiro and 2mg estradiol.

Kavik_Ryx,asktransgender,How to go about exploring one's gender when questioning identity?,"Just a couple of days ago I had a sort of semi coming out to my parents, admitting that I was having uncertainty about my gender. My parents, though uncertain about my uncertainty, were empathetic to what I have been experiencing and supportive of my desire to explore my gender. I am at a place in my life where I would feel safe transitioning and have been more open by publicly crossdressing. I hope to spend this year better understanding how I identify by exploring and expressing my gender. I just have no idea what that entails.

As of now, I confidently say I do not feel in the slightest masculine. The most I can say is that I like giant robots, action movies, and the Three Stooges. But other than the Stooges, I don't feel that any of that is essentially male. As for attitudes considered masculine, I often find myself aghast at or apathetic to what men consider to be masculine. I know that physically I have some desire to be a woman, and the way I approach the world makes me feel like I missed out on a lot by not being born a girl. Even so I don't have much of an clue how to act feminine or to explore what it means to be a woman. I didn't have a lot of examples of femininity growing up. So beyond changing my outward appearance, I don't know what I could do to better understand how I feel and what I want.

I know for some, the sense of gender is so strong that they had little doubt of it. But for those who were more ambivalent or ambiguous, what did you do to better understand whether transitioning was right for you?"

I'm 17 MTF and closeted. I've been very quiet about this, and I've managed to keep my female side a secret since I was 6 years old, although it was fine until about 5 months ago. 



I'm starting to wonder if transitioning is worth it. Yes the outcome might be better (but I'm unsure of that) but I've discovered that living as male is not as bad as I tell myself it is. I'm completely fine with going out with male, it's only when I'm alone I dislike it. 



If I live as male, I can just continue to life as if nothing is wrong with me. It's cheaper, it's easier, I don't have to wait months on end for the NHS, or worry about hormones and blood tests, seeing my doctor, reactions from everyone, and just act like none is wrong.

I like the idea of being Eloise Skye (hence the Reddit name haha) but it feels weird in actuality. Eloise feels like I'm pushing myself towards the binary too much and Skye just feels weird. I can't describe it. Maybe it's because I haven't been called either of them I don't know. Every time I've spoken to my therapist I've said I prefer a different name and I'm starting to feel a bit lame. I just can't make a decision, I've always been so indecisive @_@ "

StatsLadyNerd,asktransgender,Indecision on MTF Vag Installation,"Hey Redditers,

I'm a 35 year old trans lady who has had 3+ years of HRT, an orchie, and some minor FFS.  Genital dysphoria has always been, at its worst, only mild-to-moderate for me; it was never the primary driving factor. I still have fun sexually with what I have, and I'm lucky to have a boyfriend who loves me and my body.  The time-commitment of GCS and the  recovery period have seemed out of the question since I have a demanding job, two young children, a complicated home situation with my ex wife.  My parents and my family aren't particularly supportive of me, so I don't know how much emotional/logistical support I would get in the recovery phase of GCS, especially since I don't live in a metro area with a surgeon.

Despite the fact that I don't feel much genital dysphoria when going about my daily life, I've recently felt some strong desires to get a vag for the sake of sex.  I wonder how much is due to the fact that my bf would ideally prefer me to have a vag, even though he does like me the way I am?  (Also, my libido has been unusually low lately.) If there were a ""magical vagina"" option, I would take it in a heartbeat.  I'm having trouble weighing the pros and cons of a surgery which will cause some logistical turmoil in my family life and in my job, and which may have serious complications.  On the other hand, I think I would have taken the risk if I were 20-something grad student with parents who could take care of me for the summer.

Has anyone else gone through this thought process?  There aren't that many 30-something transitioners, it seems, so my situation might be unusual."
Ariel156,asktransgender,A confession,"I am transgender. 
The reason why I can't transition is because I am 15 years old, I go to an all boys school, I come from a very Christian family and (most importantly) it turns me on, which makes me doubt myself. I'm sure I am a girl on the inside but just the thought of trans women, not to mention being in girls clothes, satisfys me whilst making me feel like myself. It's complicated. I've felt like this since a young age but I am not sure of myself. I would like to have kids, and even if I do my girlfriend/wife would probably leave me. Why does God hate me? :("

JejuneJo,asktransgender,Being misgendered doesn't really affect me.,"What I mean by this is that being misgendered doesn't affect me when certain people do it. Since I'm not out to everyone, I couldn't even expect every to use masculine pronouns anyway. 

If I'm at school and hanging out with friends and they throw in a ""she"" and ""hers""m it doesn't really bother me. I only get bothered when they star talking about female specific thing like periods and boys(yes I know boys are not a girls only thing but in my head, talking about them makes me aware of my own femininity).

On the other hand, when my family misgenders me, it hurts. It kinda feels like I'm being stabbed and every time someone in my immediate family say ""she"" ""hers"" ""dead name"", etc, the knife digs in a little deeper.

I know that I am trans at this point, no doubt about it, but this seems a little abnormal. Why don't I feel uncomfortable all the time? Do any of you guys have the same/similar experiences?"

A little extra info:
I'm amab, 17, 4 people know, go to school, noticeably depressed but most people don't care , no HRT but already transitioning slowly since 2014 and live in belgium.

Our rights:
Our trans rights are quite good...
http://tgeu.org/trans-rights_europe_map_2016/
But I still indirectly experience a lot of transphobia and hate. A lot of people make fun of transgenders.

My healthcare story:
My dad booked my fisrt therapy somewhere november 2015. Sessions from january to march 2016. (She redirected me to Ghents clinic)
I booked my first appointment in Ghent in march 2016. That first appointment was in october 2016. There was a huge waiting list. I had to book me as an adult, makes no sense. I have to go through 6 months of sessions to get approved for HRT(lol?). I'm almost there. 
There's also a waiting list for endo. 
Per session I have to waste almost a full day of school because I'm travelling per train (1 hour ride) + (45 mins extra) twice + 1 hour session.
Price per session = +/- 105$. Dad pays 80. I pay the rest from my savings.
This is the only option for me. There aren't any other clinics in Belgium :/

My heart goes out to American students. Trump is a really bad person. 
But I've read stories of Americans that could get HRT within their first month (or even session(&lt;-- informed consent)) of therapy.
The transgender laws for students in America are worse than in Belgium but the support for transgenders is better.

What's your opinion? Which option would you choose in your situation? I'm interested.

Atorm587,asktransgender,At a complicated crossroads. Looking for advice.,"I've suffered from gender dysphoria for most of my adult life. I was diagnosed back in 2014 with primary hypogonadism. Doctor gave me various gels that failed one after another. I can't absorb them anymore. Shots screwed me up badly. I can't tolerate the horrible side effects. 

I stood at a crossroads back then as well (hormones the rest of my life regardless) and chose to go the the biological direction I was born even though I knew I wouldn't be happy. I was just afraid of my family disowning me, my friends leaving me and my career being ruined (I live in the South). I was 27 with a testosterone of 180. There are a few choices that lie before me:

1) Try to learn to tolerate the side effects from shots and continue to live a ""normal"" life. 

2) Get on an intense exercise regimen and hope it gets my levels to where they should be.

3) Take that chance I was too scared to take roughly 3 years ago and go in the opposite direction.

How on earth can I choose? It just seems like my whole life has now branched to many forks in the road. I have no idea which one to take. For those that have gone MtF, how did you make such a choice? My biological clock is ticking. I am 30. The longer I wait, the worse my outcome will be =/. "

AMSTG_Yep,asktransgender,16 Months On HRT: Help,"Hi all! I just thought I would share what has been going on with me since it has been very anxiety, stress and depression provoking. I have been on HRT now for 16 months and I have yet to have significant muscle reduction and breast growth. I used to play football in high school and I had the body of a line backer back then, and a lot of that muscle is still on me. Also, my boobs are only a 38A, and they don't even fill the whole cup. At this point, I've been pretty discouraged because I have been somewhat patient through my transition and holding onto hope that this will get better over time but that hope is slowly slipping away. 

It also doesn't help that my doctor, despite seeing the obvious rashes the estradiol patches I were leaving on me, continued to prescribe them to me and also put me on more transdermal estradiol (a compounded cream that didn't do the same thing the patches did (the rash wasn't there with the cream)). Anyways, my doctor switched me over from the transdermal estradiol to generic estrace, at a significantly lower dose than what I was on. It also doesn't help that my doctor put me on weight loss medication for diabetics since I currently weigh 230 lbs and I'm just under 5'9"".

Since starting HRT, the main things I have noticed is I  put on fifty pounds, my face looks more feminine and my body fat has distributed to more feminine places, and that seems to be about it besides the painfully slow breast growth. 

I'm just wondering, is this kind of experience normal, or is something going horribly wrong somewhere?

Bethann99,asktransgender,Recent GCS in Scottsdale...ask me anything,"I had my Gender Confirmation surgery/vaginoplasty in Scottsdale AZ in early December 2016.  I booked the procedure 15 months earlier...that was waiting list time when I booked in summer 2015).It turned out to be a marvelous experience. I had carefully followed the electrolysis instructions--expect to start a year prior to surgery as you can't control the growth cycle. 

They treated me quite well in the hospital and recovery center. Other than checking in at the hospital, changing into clothes for surgery, being wheeled in to the OR and chatting with my surgeon and anesthesiologist I have no recollection of the surgery and recovery room.  

My post surgery room at the Greenbaum center was nice enough...private room and toilet and shower room, wireless internet and a very attentive and kind nursing staff. The eight days in the hospital are a bit of a blur of routine. Order breakfast, lunch and dinner and eat same.  Watch netflix. Walk around starting the second day, etc. As for physical recovery, I experience discomfort, but not much of any real pain. I was on a morphine pump for the first day and recollect a bit of pain by very manageable. They removed the pump the second day and I never needed the pain pills they prescribed after the 2nd day. My whole crotch was bandaged up with drain tubes emptying into to ""squeezy"" vacuum bottles and my catheter coming out. Before the procedure, I thought the catheter would bother me, but it didn't.  I just needed to be mindful of the catheter line when I went for a walk.  I kept ice consistently over my bandaged crotch...never really felt that cold through all the bandages, but I'm convinced that the ice really helped with the swelling.  

Here's the typical recovery surgery:
""ONE DAY AFTER SURGERY
Today you will spend on bed rest.
You will continue to have ice packs placed on your surgical site.
The nurse will give you all necessary medications. You will be weaned off the PCA (Patient Controlled Anesthesia) and started on oral pain medication which will be supplied by the hospital.
You will be started on a light diet and will work up to a regular diet as tolerated.
The compression device will remain on your legs.
Use the incentive spirometer provided. You will be instructed by the nursing staff or respiratory therapist on how to use your spirometer. The spirometer helps exercise your lungs while you are on bed rest.
TWO DAYS AFTER SURGERY
Today you may have your IV infusion line and the compression device removed. You will be encouraged to ambulate (walk around) gently with the assistance of a nurse.
Drink plenty of fluids. Eat a well balanced diet with fruits and vegetables.
You will continue on oral pain medication, antibiotics, and Acidophilus which will be supplied by the hospital. You will also need to take your Arnica Montana (herbal supplement), that was given to you at your pre-operative appointment, as directed. 
SIX DAYS AFTER SURGERY
Your vaginal sutures and packing will be removed today by Dr. Meltzer or by one his nurses. They will also give you a demonstration on dilation and you will be dilating yourself today.
SEVEN DAYS AFTER SURGERY
Today, Dr. Meltzer or one of his nurses will take out your foley catheter.""

On recovery day six, my vagina looked like...well, like it just had surgery.  Not too pretty, but not terrible. Dialation went well and didn't hurt.  It was a strange and beautiful feeling having a vagina and feeling something inside.  My biggest worry was for day seven, the day before discharge when the catheter came out. I really didn't want to fly home with a capped catheter and make an appointment for its removal. Turns out I worried for nothing...I was able to urinate (even if it seemed to go in all directions).
I'll follow up soon with some post-discharge experience and self care tips.  In the mean time, suffice to say, that I though my vaginoplasty would simply bring be a sense of peace.  As it turns out, my mostly-healed vagina brings be peace, wonder, aesthetic and physical pleasure and joy.  "
I_Dream_of_100_Cats,asktransgender,Looking for advice to coming out to my first friend,"Hey everyone!

Like the title says, I'm looking for some advice coming out to my friend.  Though more specifically, I'm looking for some help with overall confidence in what I am saying.  I've tried coming out to him a couple times before and every time has ended in stammering and uncertainties with me not giving a clear answer.

A few things:

* I'm going to be taking things kind of slow since I'm under stress of finishing up my last semester of college and looking for a job and all that and don't want to get overwhelmed.  But I'm a little worried that it may send some mixed messages of uncertainty especially with how I've talked about it with him in the past.
* He knows that I've been thinking about this for a while and has even tried to talk to me about it a couple times after but like I said I was always vague or noncommittal.
* This is the first and only person who knows about this so far.
* We don't get a chance to talk much during the semester but they're one of if not my closest friend and I feel comfortable coming out to them about this first.

So I guess this meandering post boils down to; What are some ways to keep my confidence and not censor myself or be wishy-washy?  What are some things I should avoid doing or saying to keep from sounding uncertain or unclear?  What are some things I can do for myself to help boost my confidence beforehand?

Specifically, how do you go about starting to buy bras for your continually-growing breasts? I'm sure this is what plenty of AFAB people go through during puberty, but it seems like a bit of a different issue because I'm trans. See, what I'm thinking is, don't you have to keep buying new bras and getting rid of the old ones as your grow out of them? And what kinds of bras do you even buy at first?

I'm curious about the process for you guys. Did you use sports bras at first to hide your boobs? Did you have to keep buying new bras every month or less? I really have no idea what I'm doing."

It was the first time I had ever been called by a female name in person (Anna) or referred to as a she. The euphoria was amazing.

But now a couple days later, I'm finding myself less inclined to wear the women's clothing I had been wearing constantly. I was tempted to remove my toe polish. My shame and regret toward my wife, who is supporting me but is fearful of what is to come, is growing.

zauraz,asktransgender,Idk how to deal with my parents..?,"Hey.

Since years back I have has a hard time talking to anyone about how I feel and think. Doing it makes me feel like I become a burden on others and usually end up with me getting a harsh emotional reaction from myself that is too painful to bear so I keep up giving my hardest trying to supress it.

In securities is basically my strongpoint by now and I now realize that my coming out to my mom probably didn't really get the point forward. I am unsure if she sees it or tries to ignore it in general.

It has been a year since I told my mom that I questioned my gender. I never told her I wanted a female body outright but she asked me several times and even if my reply was not direct it implied it. She got it back then but lately it feels like she is trying to still push me down the line of me being her son. Admittedly I barely talk about any of this etc and I have not asked her to use any specific pronouns. After she told my dad we had several conversations indirectly about it and they always told me they would accept me but 'neither' wanted me to do anything drastic and have been strongly implying that they expect me to get grandchildren and generally dislike the idea of me transitioning. Lately it has dawned on me more and more that all of this is a choice I should make regardless of them..

Admittedly my mom stopped pestering me about cutting my hair. I remember almost crying whenever she did that in the past and I wanted long hair but she kept teasing me about things like ""you can't be a girl as you dislike romance"" and pestered me about specific stereotypical gender notions even if she claims men and women can be feminine/masculine respectively. The worst I guess is when we argue about things, especially the Twillight movies (lol) where she usually ends up using teases like this to tell me that I don't ""understand"" romance etc and some 'girls want to be rescued' bullcrap. I feel both rejected and invalidated talking to her but its been like that from the start and it has made it harder for me to open up to me even if I tried approaching her. I actually was a lot more open with how I felt but was met by irritation and disinterest.

My dad was someone I rarely talked about stuff with before. Its always been my mother that I am more open with although my dad is caring, we are pretty similar in being fairly introverted and also suffering from depression. Whenever this is brought up he keeps talking about how I should ""accept"" myself as I can be feminine as a male, something my mother also tried. My dad is also always indirect about that never stating directly that he basically wants me to not ""change"". I have nothing against men being masculine but its not what I want. It would never fix it. I don't know how to bring it forward but just how people see me feels wrong and being a feminine male would not fullfill the things I want. 

Arguing with my mother is something that seems to have become a staple of out conversations about this subject and maybe I am bit offensive but she usually ends up blaming me for not listening and that she only ever tries to understand me. She stills hold her theory that a surgery I had related to my genitalia caused this...

I have not really anyone its easy for me to be open with about any of these things and the people I seek support of and partially support me like being willing to cut ties with rest of relatives if they would hate me for this almost always met with slight hostility in the past and I myself have trouble opening up and I feel like a constant burden whenever I do open up. Atleast I have managed to tell some that I want a female body but no one that ""I am a girl"". I still have a hard time myself accepting that fact..""

andro_in_ar,asktransgender,"Moving from AR at the end of the year - general questions for residents of CO, WA, CA, OR, and NV","Hello, I have begun my FTM transition with HRT here in AR and am working on getting my gender marker/name changed on my state documents so that I can update my federal ones as well.  I am choosing to move out of state when I'm finished with my degree program this December, and I'm looking at the following states: Colorado, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington (in that order).  I picked these because currently they have policies banning transgender exclusions for private and state insurance programs, and because I have a close friend who would like to come with me who prefers to not move to IL or the northeast, where the remainder of the states with these policies are located. 

My questions are as follows:

*1.) What general area (of which state) do you reside in?  If you're not comfortable sharing this, just the state is cool. 

*2.) How has your experience been finding employment, obtaining healthcare, and socially?

*3.) Have you sought insurance-covered SRS, and if so what advice would you give to someone seeking the same?

*4.) Do you have any recommendations for a transgender person interested in moving to your area/state?

I understand that a lot of this is personal and it's totally fine to omit whatever information you feel like you need to in order to be comfortable posting it online.  My goal in moving is primarily to get out of this state and away from the rampant transphobia (see the recent /r/LGBT post on Jason Rapert for context), but also I'm ready to pursue top surgery and phallo and if I can get any fraction of those procedures covered by insurance it would make a world of difference to my future financially and career-wise.  

Thank you guys and ladies for any information you're willing to share.  As terrified as I am most days about the current state of affairs here in AR, not to mention the direction the federal administration is headed where our community is concerned, the thought that I'll soon be able to at least move to a more accepting place is what keeps me moving forward.

curryisprettygood,asktransgender,worried i'm missing out ?,"Hi everyone !

I'm in high school, and am not out yet. I am not ready to come out, but I'm worried that I'm going to miss my chance to experience high school as my true self (have teachers use my preferred name, get to change out in the right locker room, etc). 

I'm also worried that if I don't go on hormones before I leave high school, or if I decide not to go on them at all, that I'll be missing out even more (having people use my right pronouns without asking, not being questioned when using the right bathroom, having people get crushes on me without thinking that I'm a girl). I know these things happen outside of high school, but honestly I really want those cheesy, dramatic high school experiences people show in sitcoms, and I want to have them as myself, yknow ?

I want to come out and have these experiences (maybe join a boys sports team !!), but I don't know how to start or if I'm ready. I only have 1-2 years of high school left. Anyone else have a similar experience and have any wisdom on the subject ? Should I wait until I move schools again to come out (a fresh start) ? or should I come out as soon as possible so I can experience more ? Or should I wait until I'm truly 100% sure that I'm ready ? Thanks !"
fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,Do you find that some people make you really dysphoric (and some don't at all),"I've noticed how some women make me dysphoric than others (some don't at all).


One of my teachers at college is young (Early 20s?) and is really feminine, has a really feminine body and she triggers it so much, whereas another female teacher who I have (late 30s / early 40s) doesn't trigger it at all.



When I was at school (way before I knew what gender dysphoria was) there was a school uniform. It was mostly the same, except girls had the option of wearing skirts and tights as well. I used to look at them and wish I could wear skirts like them, but I never thought about being female. Also at primary school there was an option of wearing a school uniform dress in the summer (Here in the UK all schools have uniform) and I'd fantasize about being forced to wear one as a punishment to school (I was 9 I think). 



But tomboys and girls that don't really dress that feminine do not trigger it at all, I don't even think about it. Its kinda like this that makes me think I am more of a crossdresser rather than MTF.

It wasn't until recently that I myself realized that I was so obsessed with these guys not because I fantasized about them, but about being them.

Working out:
 Anyways I've been working on my weight, for a good two years now. currently at 170, 5'11"", and 18 years old (so endurance isn't an issue for any exercises). I'd say I'm almost at my goal but I'am at what feels like the home stretch, I only really want to lose whats left of my belly fat and a few lbs on my legs. I already run and do group fit classes, but looking for ways (workouts or a circuit) to really burn what fat I have left. A gym is available to me. I've heard stair stepper is good for shaping booty, thinking like bicycles + a lot of crunches (wanting to focus more on my core to get rid belly fat) 

- curious if the hormones would affect my wight gain/loss?   (currently on 100mg sprio + 4mg estrodial/day) 

- good belly fat burning exercises?

Hair/body care:
If you were limited on money (like 80-100 USD a month), what are the absolute must haves for you. I have nice shampoo/conditioner, hydrate w/ lotion often, wash face, and saving for electrolysis. Anything else major I should be doing? (I just want to do everything in my power to help the feminization process, I want to maximum my passing potential)

- Any tips on feeling better about body hair? *especially facial hair* (I already shave, but I hate it, it takes forever and know it damages my skin. however it does make me feel better about myself) 

- places to get cheep cloths? (do like all of my shopping at goodwill anyways) 

- Where to get cheep makeup? (2 expensive)  

- Any other advice about living cheap and transitioning? 

Appreciate any responses, thanks!"

I rescheduled my appointment with my Endo for June, I'll be 46 then; I also asked my PCP to refer me for an Orchi.

I will not live with the back and forth, the pull is too strong when it hits. My wife seems to have known this all along and is very supportive of it, me I'm just waiting to see if the ""trans feelings"" go away again.

I get so inspired when I see timeliness, and happy when people get small victories like legal changes and acceptance at work.  It makes me belive that I can do this.  

I had a pretty good start into transition before, but now instead of the panic and acceptance I felt inside myself I feel oddly comfortable with this decision.  I still have feelings like I am too fat, too old, to ugly all those good insecurities all people have.  

The thing of it is I know the secret to my transition will be discipline and consistency, the same keys to success in other areas of my life.

So, I know others have done the whole stop and start thing, but how did you use the knowledge you gained from the first time around when it came to starting back into transition. Thanks."

SerraJaneC,asktransgender,Therapy or why didn't I do this years ago?,"So, in short, I made a throwaway account post about a week ago on how I came out to my wife as seriously questioning everything about myself (and always had). I'm 36, and there are some serious passing issues if I decide to go the whole way, but I felt like I needed to at least sort myself out, and so I scheduled a therapy session. Nervous, but excited, I showed up at 6 last night.

Holy cow... I should have done this years ago. I was the last appointment of the night, so we talked until almost 7:30. It was the baseline type things... tell me about your family, the first time you felt different gender wise, etc. But just getting a lot off my chest was so liberating.

He asked me a lot of tough questions, but two that floored me by my response and left things to think about until next week. First was (paraphrased), ""You've got a full closet of clothes, all types, all colors. There's no social expectations. What do you wear daily?"" And I replied without thinking or hesitation, ""Skirts and dresses."" It wasn't the answer, but the assuredness and quickness with which I replied.

The second thing was, ""If you looked down, what would you feel most comfortable seeing?"" and for the first time in my life, I said out loud that I'd probably be more comfortable with a woman's body. He reassured me not to read too much into it, but it was pretty intense actually. Kind of scary in a lot of ways, too.

So I'm not sure where my journey's going, but I thought I'd share my first experience. I don't know what is ultimately going to make me happy, but I'm looking forward to next week. "

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,Questions about weight (X posted on /r/ftm) (and mostly just rambling about being annoyed lol),"I know I could probably post this on some fitness sub, and that people will probably suggest I do, but I'm really not that into fitness, plus I feel safer posting on trans subs since they are the ones I frequent and have experience with. 

I don't really understand the technical things to do with weight like bmi, or muscle mass weight, or what specific things will definitely make you lose weight for sure, and all that. I just know the general-ness of getting in some regular exercise will help you to stay at a healthy weight. 

I'm only 5foot, but I weight 145lbs, and even though it doesn't seem to really show according to [this](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/obesity/how-much-should-i-weigh.php) that weight is overweight for my height. However even though in the past few months I've gone from sitting at home all day every day, to having a job where I'm on my feet all day, and to walking a half mile home from the train every day, as well as lifting weights most days, I've stayed in the 145-147 range for the past year (I started this job and all around november, but was this weight for the whole year before then, and am still this weight). I had been 147 for a long time, and today discovered that I had gone down to 145. When I got this job I was excited about the prospect of being a bit more active would help me lose weight...but I thought it would work a lot faster. I know I'm being annoying by complaining and being impatient, but this is the first time I've ever felt like I was sort of actively trying to lose weight. 

I've always eaten healthy, so I don't really have any diet issues. I know a lot of people might suggest I go to the gym or go out walking more, but for now I don't do that stuff just because binding is a legit pain in the ass when doing that sort of stuff, and on any days I don't have work, I'd really like to be able to just keep that as a binding free day. I'm getting top surgery soon (end of march) and am planning to start doing way more exercise-y things once I'm able to post op. I'm planning to start rock climbing, and on going to the gym. 

If the only exercise you're doing though is just walking every day, how fast will most people generally lose weight? The only exercise my parents do is walking, and not even every day, maybe just two or three times a week (if that), and they're able to lose like 5lbs a month this way...and then here I am having lost 2lbs in like 4 months. 

If I've stayed around the same weight range for over a year (145-147lbs) despite going from absolutely no exercise to some exercise does that mean that is my body's natural healthy weight? And if so, once I start adding more exercise like biking and rock climbing later this year, will it actually do anything to make me lose weight, or will my weight continue to remain in this same range? 

I just don't really know how losing weight works lol. Everyone else I know who has/is trying to lose weight does it by going on crazy diets that have commercials on TV and stuff (atkins, weightwatchers, etc) and by spending half a day at the gym every day, and that's just not the type of person I am or ever will be...but I still want to try and lose weight. I just don't know how to do that without being that type of crazy dieting gym every day all day type of person because that's all I've ever seen others around me do. "

ForeverBenned,asktransgender,Possible Protest Method against transphobic bathroom bills?,"So I just read another users question regarding going topless at public pools [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ux3mx/going_to_the_public_pool_topless/) and some seemed to be rightly concerned about nudity laws, so that got me thinking....


What if those states where bathroom bills are being implemented that force the *state* to treat someone by their gender assigned at birth, what if in those states we had transwomen and transmen  go  topless in organized protest (perhaps on public beaches)?


If the state treats transwomen as men, then they can't be guilty of laws which allow men to go topless on public beaches and such.


It creates public attention to the issue, points out a current systemic hypocrisy and inconsistency in law, and makes the religious zealots confused at which way they should go!


I think it might be just perfect. 


Non-uptight people will even get a kick out of it while the uptight ones that brought the bathroom bills will be forced to re-think their priorities and conflicting thoughts on the issue. "

AliceInThong,asktransgender,Nurture complementing not versus nature?,"Hey,

a while ago I had this idea about various aspects of sexuality being influenced by nurture (/r/asktransgender/comments/5qgpcs/how_do_you_know_what_it_feels_like_to_be_the/dcz6eod/). Reading a bit more and thinking about it, this idea got a new spin.

As we grow, our physical bodies change differently and that is caused by our DNA. But we all start at the same blank state - two cells merging into one. It seems that there is no one to blame for being a short adult, except for one's genes. All we can say is ""I was born like this"".

We all know that some hard work can turn an overweight person into a more or less muscular figure. What if we believe grandma's idea that hanging from trees in childhood will allow one to grow more than DNA sequencing results would expect? Maybe quite a lot of things are predetermined to go in a particular direction, but that does not mean we cannot change them. Building on this, maybe the way our parents raise us determine a lot about our character?

This is where I began to think what could be the process steering us to any direction. Why it just so happens that multiple persons experiencing the same situation learn different things from it? And I thought, that the way we learn is not only determined by our sensory inputs, but our body chemistry as well. It is known that hormone (and other) levels fluctuate over various time scales. Maybe those are wired to be additional input to our brain, maybe they influence the way we parse perceived world.

Back to the topic of this sub. Maybe at certain moments people having body chemistry levels affected by both their mood and genetically predetermined fluctuations gain the experience of the situation for different aspects? This idea could be used to explain why some people grow into successful leaders while others are followers. To explain various aspects of sexuality. Of course it is probably impossible to gather scientific data for convincing research on this idea, but I found it interesting exercise for the mind.

What do others think about it?"

transthrowaway2223,asktransgender,Change in urine smell ?,"Posting with throwaway because this is really embarrassing.

I was on the patch for about a year. My doctor switched me to pill form about 2 months ago. Last month, out of no where my urine smell changed. It's hard to described but it's almost sweet smelling.

After Googling around, they say it could be diabetes.  Which doesn't make any sense because I very rarely eat sugar. Never eat candy, ice cream or soda. I am thin and eat well.  

The smell comes and goes. Has anyone else experienced this ? It didn't seem to start until I switched to pill form. 

My next doc appointment isn't for another 3 months. :(

AgnosticThalassocnus,asktransgender,Some thoughts regarding gender identity and expression.,"I apologize for not really asking any questions, but I just need a medium through which I can flesh out my thoughts.

For some background: I'm 20 years old, AMAB and I've been on HRT for almost 11 months now. I visually ""pass"" as a cisgender female, but I have no interest in going ""stealth"" and prefer to use an androgynous voice to a feminine one. I was raised in a relatively conservative household and felt pressured as a child to be a masculine, heterosexual male. This made me miserable, as I discovered in adolescence that I was not a *heterosexual* male nor even a *male* at all. Once I began my transition, I rejected masculinity in favor of femininity, believing that by embracing a female gender identity and expression, my gender dysphoria would go away. While expressing myself more femininely did relieve a good deal of my dysphoria, it did not remedy the issue entirely. At the end of the day, I do not feel entirely female nor do I feel that I am entirely not male. 

If I had to describe my gender identity, I would say that it is simultaneously ""femininely masculine"" and ""masculinely feminine"", if that makes sense. I don't feel entirely male or female, nor do I feel entirely neutral, nor do I feel like I am both male and female. I'm just somewhere in the middle. I'm sure that there are plenty of possible labels that I could adopt. Personally, I often use the terms ""Trans"", ""Genderqueer"" and, as of recently, ""Androgyne"" to describe myself, but I prefer not to give labels too much power. If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them."

zauraz,asktransgender,Feelings of being left out?,"I had to ask this somewhere so it ended up here. I am still pre everything in transitioning and not out with being trans or a girl.

Here in Sweden feminism and female empowerment is everywhere around me, in school, at home and its discussed a lot. There is a great push to make equality a thing. Sadly it sometimes turns to denouncing men instead and bringing forth women as better but mostly its just equality.

I love all of this and the push for equality but I feel left out. All this female empowerment talk etc and for some reason I can't fathom I feel like I am outside of this, not allowed in, excluded. I can't understand why but whenever I am around people talking about this I can't help but feel like the oddball out. First its the fact that my body is ""male"" and it feels like I am worth less. Then there is my true self and the girl self which sort of wants to take part of this, to feel included and a part of it, idk what to do but it fills me with melancholia most of the time and the feeling that I will never truly be able to feel like a part of any of that as I did not have the luck of being born with the correct gender..

I apologize if this sounds like denouncing feminism or anything and that is really not the intention. I am for equality 100% and really care about issues like that but with my current body and internal gender I feel both left out and worth less due to the biological body I inherit.

addition* It feels like asking this is forcing myself into something I never have been a part of. I don't see where I would have the right to partake in this but idk."

fuzzyroundthings,asktransgender,Question about changerooms,"(My language might be a bit graphic, I'm not actually sure what the protocol is in this sub, my apologies)

I want to preface this by saying that I'm a trans woman, been transitioned for a little over nine years now. I think we're all very aware that bathroom bills are being debated endlessly, not just in the US but also in Canada where I live. Right now a lot of people are specifically upset about the question of penises in women's changerooms.

My question is this: Even if the law were entirely on your side, does anybody here actually *want* to expose their penis in women's changerooms? I can't help but think that this is mostly a non-issue. 

My surgery was years ago, but even if the law said it was fine back then I wouldn't have gone completely naked in any changeroom. It wouldn't just be an issue of my own dysphoria, but the recognition that it would very easily make people uncomfortable and that I have no desire to cause a scene when I just want to use the gym in peace. It's just so much easier to change in a private stall. I know my feelings are my own and I was wondering what other trans people felt about this. 

Just to be clear, I am in no way opposing legislation to protect trans people or let us use the washroom we're most comfortable with. I'm only asking about whether or not there are significant numbers of trans people who, in this current political climate, are actually interested in lounging around a women's changeroom with their penis out.

So today marks first day of the rest of my life! I have a really big smile on right now! :)"
Quiann,asktransgender,Could use some advice.,"For the last 7 years at least (possibly longer, but I tend to be cautious on these kinds of this. Brief note is that I'm 20), I've consistently wished to be a woman. (By consistently I mean every day, generally multiple times.) Not for a day, but for the rest of my life.


My desire isn't to be a girly girl, I imagine that as a girl, I would largely be dressing similar, though more recent crossdressing experience makes me feel very comfortable.


perhaps my biggest question source is that I don't feel trapped in my body. I don't like men's bodies in general (heterosexual as a male), I've never wanted big muscles, or to look tough or for that matter have any other male body than my own.


This may be helped by the fact that aside from my height (6'0) I have a soft face (enough to the point I find it passable as a female's with some makeup and the right hair), size 8 feet and my hands are smaller than my 5'7 mother's and similar to my 5'1 sister's. Shaving my entire body has helped me feel a good deal more free as well. 


Even though I've spent many nights wishing I were born female I still feel ok with my own body. The closest thing to feeling trapped is the fear that I will be stuck with harder features, balding etc as I get older. By comparison I don't fear being an older woman.


Personality wise I'm not particularly masculine, or feminine. I tend to be very positive, gentle, playful and analytical. I'm also introverted, comfortable being alone and really don't feel social pressure. As a woman I don't imagine I'd be particularly different, my life plans (work, travel etc) I would see as remaining consistent regardless of what happens. 


My greatest concerns if I transitioned would be:

1. Family, both present and future.
I wouldn't want either of my parents to feel hurt, fortunately they're both open minded on topics like this. My greater concern is that I do want to have a family one day, and I fear that transitioning would get in the way of that.

2. Loss of sexual attraction / function.
I fear losing all attraction / function. Were this required to transition then it would be a deal breaker. I'm not sure if this would reflect on what I am / should do. I would like to know if this is a concern for anyone who has transitioned.

3. Violence / discrimination 
Mostly violence, it's unfortunate that this is a concern. Fortunately I do live in Canada and have an affinity for urban center.


For now I'm planning laser hair removal for my facial hair (After reading into this as a possible solution to get rid of most of the hair without electrolysis, (fortunately for me I have pale, white skin with near black hair) and while at this point I'm as close to 100% certain I want to be a woman and I'm willing to say, I'm still contemplating what I'm willing to do and accept and will likely do so for a while longer.


I would like to know if anyone has been down a similar path. What would you recommend ? any important questions that I am papering over. Thanks for reading and for any answers.

lordhaxsupreme,asktransgender,Conflicts inside of me: Can you help?,"I need to write my dilemma somewhere so I thought here might be a good start. Sometimes I wake up an entirely different person. It completely surprised me when I realised. Sometimes I turn into a girl and we quite often have some conflicts in interest. I want to listen to old classical rock and pop music, but she seems to be interested in Future Bass and Dubstep, not that I mind of course, that’s her choice. 

My sister/counterpart/whatever has been developing over the past eight to ten years, around puberty, but I think she might have been dormant for longer. Yes, I have always considered myself a man throughout my whole life up to this point, but having discovered that sometimes I am a woman sort of scares me, I never wanted to be considered some sort of trans person, it doesn’t sound right to me at all. It’s just that sometimes I’m a man, sometimes I’m not, although when I’m not I guess I’m not me at all. 

For some reason, we can argue with each other too, which confuses me a little. I’ll say one thing and she’ll counter it, then I’ll argue against that, and It might continue on for ages inside our head, or more often, on paper. Ever since I became aware of my identity I have found that writing my thoughts soothes me and makes the whole idea more comforting. My counterpart is, of course, aware of what I feel just as I am aware of her thoughts too, but putting it all down on paper makes both of us feel better about our situation.

The problem is, both of us have a few friends at our college that are kind of against this kind of thing. They’re nice people overall, but I don’t think I’d want to come out until I leave for University, but that won’t be for another year and a half yet, which bugs me. We should be moving out of our home into shared accommodation soon, meaning I don’t have to worry too much about what my family thinks, but then again, just like my friends, I worry that they might disown me.

Oh, that’s another thing. I said about conflicts of interest between us both? Well, my counterpart and I don’t want to do the same uni course, and we don’t want to go to the same uni either, which is a headache. I have no idea how to solve this issue when we have to reach a decision, because one day it might be me in control, the next it might not be, and if one of us is stuck on a course we don’t even like and has to go to lectures, then we’ll end up not doing as well as we should.

I hope I don’t insult all of you transgender people out there but I’m not sure what to think, whether it’s wrong, whether I’m making it all up, so I need answers. I came here to write down some of my problems and I hope you can help me, I don’t want to feel conflicted but I just can’t help myself, especially with us being CofE christians and all. 

Thanks a lot.

Namizou,asktransgender,Hard to picture myself living as a regular woman?,"So, I've been questioning myself for the past 2 years (I'm 18 now), maybe more, and I'm still unsure if I really am a transgender woman or just really confused.
I've decided to mark an appointment with a gender therapist and hopefully I'll get some answers.

One of the ""signs"" that gets me thinking is that I have this strong wish to have a female body and look, which I noticed when trying women's underwear or lipstick, that give me a very intense feeling of happiness (even though there is some sexual pleasure associated with it, it's clear to me, specially in the case of lipstick, that it is far more than that).
What bugs me is that even though I feel this way and I think about these issues a lot of the time, everyday (or maybe 99% of them), sometimes I find myself feeling, while doing something or talking to somebody, that I must have a very regular boy-ish posture, gestures and hobbies, which get me thinking that I probably wouldn't ever be able to learn/ to adapt to women's usual postures, gestures and activities. For example, I never really cared a lot about how I look, and I'm unsure if it means that I really don't care about it anyway (which would be a problem because of make-up and passing) or if it is caused by the fact that I don't like my body as has been until now...

Have you felt anything like this? I tried to explain the feeling as well as I could, but I still feel I wasn't particularly successful... :/

zauraz,asktransgender,Sexuality and being trans..? [slight NSFW],"Hi.

Since I was young I have had a very distancing and alienated stance from my sexuality. I have always had trouble imagining the act of sex and even been disgusted/weirded out by the idea of doing it as a man. This alongside physical relief weirds me out in general and makes me feel disgusted by myself.

Several months ago I 'accepted' myself as pansexual. When I was younger I was always for some reason intrigued and worried about being homosexual because of growing up in a society where people actively joked about it etc. But I realized that in all honesty I could be with anyone as its the personality that matters the most for me and not the attractiveness/sexuality. This however got quite a shake up later. I have always been sexually attracted to women and not men even if I am open to being with a man but something changed. I tried imagining myself as a girl with another girl and this awoke feelings I have never felt, ever before. Unlike being a boy with a girl, imagining being a girl with a girl made me feel 'right', I felt like I desired something like that. Its hard to describe how I felt but just that idea made me feel amazing idk.

This made me consider that maybe I am a lesbian even though I am still open to being with men, nothing brings the same emotional response from the idea of being with a girl as a girl. I can't explain why I get this reaction nor why I don't get the same reaction imagining myself as male...

Idk, any thoughts on what this could be? Sorry for the bad english and rushed thingy."

transquestion_,asktransgender,ftm here struggling with identity issues,"i'm biologically female and transitioning to male (sorry this is a throw away account i just don't want this on my main account).  the really off thing is that i find myself identifying a lot more with mtfs than ftms and struggle with seeing myself as ftm because i don't want to transition past the point of not being physically perceived as trans.  i feel like trans men get so much more privilege and in some ways im ashamed to be a transmasculine person.  something about that shame somehow bonds me deeper to the transfeminine struggle.  it probably doesn't help that i'm sexually attracted to trans women and feel ashamed of the fact that i would rather a trans woman biologically than a cis woman since i shouldn't be seeing them as different.

basically making a throw away because i know that this all could get a ton of flack.  i hate myself for it because it's confusing and feels like a horrible thing to admit to.  in some ways i struggle with the fact that i was born in a female body because i feel like i should have been born in a male body but know that i would have still transitioned.  i know that i'm not 100% female or 100% male and somewhere in the spectrum, as in i like to identify as trans instead of cis.  i would struggle with a cis body no matter what that body was gendered.

August1453,asktransgender,Anyone's experience similar to mine? (the envy/attraction quandary versus classic transgenderism),"I know all our experiences are unique, so I'm not expecting a perfect echo response from anyone.  Likewise, I'm not positing the old, externally unanswerable *am I trans?* question.  So I don't need an answer there.  I just want to know if anyone has experienced something more or less similar to me.


I'm a biological hetero male (posted here several times before), and I'm trying to figure out if my trans-ish feelings are ""just"" some sort of hetero attraction-based *envy* of women, or a more ""legitimate"" transgender identity.


My confusion arises from the fact that I don't seem to fall neatly into either the category of the classic transgender MtF, or the ""fetishistic"" autogynephile (which is a pretty pejorative term that I reject and which has been discredited, but has to serve in this case for lack of a better term).  


For example, I don't see myself as transgender in that I feel no actual body dysphoria and never have.  I generally don't mind my male identity at all.  I mostly never had the typical gender dysphoria experiences growing up.  So it might seem like whatever feelings I have now are ""just"" of the late-in-life erotic ""kink"" variety.


*...BUT...*


I've never crossdressed in a sexual context, don't fantasize about being a woman in a sexual encounter, and derive no arousal at the thought of either of those.  My feelings are much more related to envy rather than eroticism.  Like, I want to be able to wear stylish women's clothes, be seen as a woman and perceived as having female attributes, etc.  A lot of this is in a public social context.  When I think of myself in certain random situations, I often automatically mentally portray myself with a female avatar of some sort.  It's basically, *women are so attractive; why WOULDN'T I want to be one?*


**So, long story short:**  I don't seem to be transgender (no real dysphoria to speak of, don't fit the classic profile, no desire to transition, heterosexual); but neither do my feelings seem reducible to any sort of fetishistic pathology (no significant erotic feelings at transgender thoughts, focus is mainly on non-sexual female attributes, outwardly directed, etc).



Is this ringing any bells with anyone?  I seem to be fitting two profiles, and neither, at the same time.


Thanks.

I realize im being bigoted and harmful to myself, but theres a reason

Whenever i imagine having sex as a girl, it seems oretty great. But im still in this male body, getting aroused at that thought.  I feel like i ha e a transformation fetish. Once the transformation is over, will i be bored kf life again? When i got near with girls sexually in my past, i always had mixed feelings. Yes im supposed to like penetrating them and heck, the thought of being enveloped by a vagina is arousing, in a more basal way than my ""autogynephilia"".  I worry that arousal is more real, because its the way nature intended it or whatever.  But it really feels more real, and maybe i just habe some brajn disconnect that males me afraid of having sex with a girl.  I want all the social benefits gis have, and the thought of being one anatomically is a turn on. Why is it a turn on?!  Sometimes i hate havinf a penis, but i still want to have sex with a girl to experience it, even tho part of me is grossed out (and yet the thought of being with a girl besides genitally, i guess im somewhat asexual/aromantic depending if guy or girl)

Why cant i just accept it? Because im on the fence.  Sex as a guy makes me feel not right but also good.  Imagining sex as a girl sounds right but im not a real girl, i guess is how i feel.  We are homlogous genitally but not identical, not able ti be surgically made identical. Oh and surgery is shit tons of money to go to suporn, the only surgeon im interested in. Way too much. But thats besides the point; im ranting. 

TL;DR  I cant get past the mixed feelings when aroused. Fml. FmFL. Is dysphoria just something im somehow creating because of hating male side of binary and becoming a woman alleives that?  "

Kaetlynn,asktransgender,Does saying that you attended an oppoaite-gendered friend's bachelor/bachelorette party automatically out you? Is it different for guys or girls?,"Was talking with two friends at work, one who knew me pre transition, and the other I am (as far as I know) stealth to. I asked the guy something about what we had done at his bachelor party several years ago, and immediately internally went ""oh shit"" because I think I caught a weird look from the girl. 

Did I just out myself to her, or is ""a girl attending the bachelor party is a little weird"" more likely her thought process than ""hey, u/kaetlynn might be trans""? (Not the end of the world if she figures it out, but I have liked the fact that for the last 10 months since I took this job, the people on my team just treat me as my gender because they don't know my history). 

What about trans guys who are at least partly stealth to some people, do you need to hide the fact that you'd ever gone to bachelorette parties?

Is either type of party more strongly mono-gendered?"

awkwardpegasus,asktransgender,"People with Aetna Insurance in Orange County, CA","Which doctor did you see to get letters of rec for surgery? My PCP is virtually clueless when it come to trans (though to be fair they are clueless almost all the time given their 1 star rating on yelp). In the past they referred to 2 supposedly gender therapist but both of them were specialized in gay therapy, not gender therapy. Does anyone know/have good recommendation for a doctor that can write letters that accept Aetna around here?

Also just a side note, it might not really matter, but I think I should state it anyway. I would prefer if the doctor is more like a consenting doctor. Even with Aetna I still have to copay $60, and given that it usually take like 2-3 months to get an appointment around here, I don't want to have more visit than necessary. I consider myself to be pretty passable, I have been transitioning since I was 13 and been living full time since I was 15. I have only started HRT in May last year however, but that shouldn't matter too much since I only need 1 year of HRT and then 2 weeks off prior to surgery. Pretty much all of my legal document except passport state me as female (I'm MTF yes), and I'm in the process of getting that passport fix as well. With all that being said, the point I'm trying to make is that I don't need counselling. I know who I am, I'm very sure with my identity. I would prefer if I can make this quick so I can get surgery by next year (I plan to have SRS in May 2018 if possible).

My plan is acquire 2 letters, and then send them to Dr. Marci Bowers to have her ask my insurance to approve my surgery. Hopefully if all go well, I don't have to pay more than between 7k - 12k for surgery at most.

LanvinC9,asktransgender,"Any transgender women who are absolutely not in to the ""girly girl"" stuff?","Most transgender women that I see on TV, newspaper or the media in general are always very feminine. Meaning, they are very in to the typical ""girly girl"" stuff like makeup, shopping, dresses, purses, high heels etc.

So I was wondering are there any transgender women who are not in to (or even hate) those kind of things? 

And if so, I can imagine that your coming out was maybe a bit harder than other transgender women who like the ""girly girl"" stuff. I can imagine that people say things like ""Are you sure you're trans because you don’t like makeup/shopping/dresses etc.""

How do you deal with this? Do you like 'fake it'? For example, act like you are in to shopping just because people will believe you more that you're trans?

40-4,asktransgender,Questions about transitioning,"Soo... I'd like some help

I'm a transgender MtF teen and am pre-everything and am currently questioning how I'll go about transitioning. I'm also
currently trying(emphasis on) to find out my sexuality and I've decided that I sway in the way of women(or femenimity
or what ever the right term is), but cannot deny that I've also fancied men and nonbinary folk. So I realised that if
I do NOT opt for the bottom surgery, I could have bio kids. I'm not really sure if I have critical dysphoria enough
towards my genitalia to be sure that SRS is something I could chose without having to think about. I mean, it's pretty
difficult to go doing regular Phallus things but I've never experienced what it's like to have a Vagina.

Also I've heard that Spiro (and other pill based testosterone blockers) kills your fertility after 6-8 months so I'd
like to know if anyone opted for pills (and maybe if they didn't do SRS) to ask what happened to their fertility?

Man, I wish I had a uterus...."

vegeta0077,asktransgender,Has anyone looked into clavicle lengthening/deltoid implants?,"Yeah I know I should be happy in my own body and all that stuff but I would prefer to not hear that type of stuff in the comments. Basically I know people have broken their clavicles/collarbones and sometimes they gain or lose shoulder width on each shoulder. 

There is a doctor in Beverly Hills who said he preforms it, http://web.archive.org/web/20150113005221/http://www.leifrogersmd.com/site/old%20site/male_shoulder_widening.html 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23482270

I am worried because he is not even an orthopedic surgeon, but why would he lie about this, couldn't he get in serious trouble? Technically the method distraction osteogenesis can be applied to any bone. This doctor is pretty well known in Beverly Hills CA. If people break their collarbones in football/other sports and the breaks aren't clean, why is this surgery considered dangerous? Hasn't clavicle lengthening/shortening technically be done already in normal patients who have broken collar bones? I would really appreciate others help on this.... thank you. I also see how reducing the width could be very dangerous, but lengthening it doesn't seem as bad. "
A_Dubious_Rat,asktransgender,Anyone ever need to take a break from trans subreddits like this to focus on transitioning?,"When I first discovered this community it was a boon to my life. Things were finally starting to make sense and I felt more validated then I ever had been before.

However now that I have come to terms with myself I feel like trans subreddits have become a crutch of sorts. I find myself browsing these subreddits as some sort of cathartic experience instead of actually moving forward with my transition.

In addition to this I see other trans folks facing crippling depression and suicidal thoughts (and sadly sometimes more than just thoughts) because of things like their age and ability to pass, two things that I honestly become more self-conscious of *after* frequenting this subreddit.

I realize that for some people passing is not just a convenience but crucial to their ability to survive. I also realize that transitioning early has some obvious advantages. But it didn't take long for me to suddenly start questioning if I should even transition once I saw other people talking like our lives would be ruined if we didn't transition in our teens and if we don't pass 100%.

The number of threads I started to see pop up with people considering or actually stopping their transition altogether because they felt they wouldn't pass or they felt too old to start HRT...*in their mid twenties*. As someone about to hit 27 this trend really freaked me out. I started seriously considering if a life of depression and dysphoria was worth not dealing with an ""imperfect"" transition. It's complete bs and I can't surround myself with that sort of negative toxicity anymore. I can't be in a community where people just project their insecurities onto each other, especially when so many of us are already in extremely vulnerable positions.

Please know that this isn't meant to be a jab at anyone in particular or the community in general in any way. These occurrences are just the byproduct of communities like this existing in the first place. People here are in a lot of pain and they need a place to express that. It's just sometimes I feel like our pain is worsened by unhealthy ideals often perpetuated from within the community. We can't always help if this happens sometimes, but we can talk about it and maybe try to figure out ways to reduce future occurrences and the amount of harm caused.

*Whew*. That was a lot. Anyway in closing I've been thinking of taking a break from any non-humor trans subreddits until I actually start getting somewhere with my transition, since browsing these places continuously puts me in a weird funk.

Anyone else feel a similar way? Am I completely in the wrong here? Other thoughts/experience worth sharing?"
CreamyMarshmellow,asktransgender,Is it normal to feel this nervous about transitioning?,"Considering this is something I've waited 3 years for, I'm going in for my first discussion of hormones next month and I'm getting nervy and anxious. It's such a big step but this is something I have wanted for a while now. Why is it now I feel anxious? Almost as if I might regret it. "
curesweets,asktransgender,"I'm sure you get a lot of us, but confused new person here.","So for the past two decades I've lived life as a typical cis male. Or at least I've attempted to. I've never been particularly masculine. I dislike hyper-masculine social settings and while I can't say I prefer the other side of the spectrum, I guess I envy it. It's like glancing at the female clothes section in a store and thinking to yourself ""ah, must be nice..."" sort of thing. That sort of lingering feeling has always been there, though it's only really peaked once before this point.

I just kind of figured I was just a guy who liked feminine cute things, which is totally cool, and for a while I was satisfied with that even if it meant keeping my interest in that sort of thing obscured from family. But at the end of the last year, while I was sort of reflecting on things, it just kind of hit me that I'd want to *be* a girl. Like, if I could hit a button right now that'd switch everything over, I would do it, particularly because I'd like to be cute.

I'd always been dissatisfied with my looks. I've tried to tweak and mess with things a bit in terms of how I style my hair or how I dress to get over this, but nothing quite works. I'm in my mid twenties, but people always tell me I still look like I'm in high school, which is one of the few compliments I tend to get that actually brings some sort of relief to me when it comes to looks. However, it just sort of hit me that sooner rather than later I'm going to really start looking my age. I don't really want that. I already obsessively shave my facial hair every day, because I hate it, and the idea of getting more masculine frightens me.

It's not even that I feel that I'm unattractive. I think that for a guy I do alright. Definitely not super attractive, but I'm not ugly. But I still don't like it. I don't even think I'd want to be what is considered relatively attractive for a guy these days. But I've become increasingly envious of how women look. I find if I'm looking at a woman, it's not even because I want a relationship with her, but because I'm envious of her looks.

I think one of the few times I've been relatively excited to try something with regards to my looks is when I had to play a woman in a small scene for acting class in high school. The plan was to bring in a dress, and do my hair and even put on make-up to make it as authentic as possible. That made me super excited. I really wanted to do it (although I didn't really express it as much as I was feeling it). However, it didn't really pan out that way, and I just sort of wore a dress and that's it. I was really disappointed about that. I'm *still* disappointed about that. I don't even think I'd look that good like that, I'm still fairly masculine looking even if I look young, but I'd like to try it...

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I feel like I'm probably trans, but there's a part of me that desperately wants to find any sort of means to shatter that. It's the fear at work, I guess? My friends wouldn't take that well at all... My mother, I have no idea... Transitioning seems like such an insurmountable task and I don't even know if I'd be satisfied with it.

I know I should seek gender therapy, but I'm insured under my mom's insurance so I'm not sure how to go about that without her knowing. I do go to a small group therapy session at my university for LGBTQ people, though, so that's bee helping a little bit. I don't know. I guess I just needed to get this all out there and hear some other perspectives, or something. It's been on my mind constantly for the past two months. Sorry it's so long-winded.

ungracefully,asktransgender,Spiro or E first?,"My doc wants to stagger them (one starting 2-4 weeks after the other) so she can figure out which one's at fault if I start experiencing negative effects, but she said that I can pick which one I want to start first.

I haven't seen much literature online about this (and the time interval is not so large that it probably makes a great deal of difference in the long run). Given that my T levels are pretty low (~200 ng/dL, which is lower than the normal male range and way lower than normal for someone my age) I think it might be better to start E first but I'm not sure if there's any reason I should not do this.

Anybody have experiences/links to papers on this? Given the short interval between starting the two treatments I'm mostly interested in the mental effects (I heard that spiro without E may cause listlessness and lethargy which might be something to avoid), but also the physical ones (esp. related to hip growth/fat redistribution).

I'm at the beginning my transition (I began HRT last month and still in the closet IRL everywhere, no changes at all for now except nipples soreness fyi), and I plan to come out next winter.

But I also need to grow my hair. For now I have kind of a short hair cut,  [here is a pic in boy-mode took this morning](http://imgur.com/a/4erbR), and I really don't know how I can manage to grow my hair right down to my shoulders or above. I'm working as a business/creative employee, and I'm conscious this is not exactly the dresscode of this environnement (people have more of a 3-days beard and very short hair). In fact, long hair for men isn't in the dresscode at all in professional environnement, except in IT. 

Particularly, I know there is will be a phase (when my hair will be right under my jaw) when it will be pretty ridiculous.

caitlynjconklin,asktransgender,When is the best time for me to cycle progesterone?,"Hi,

I would like to cycle progesterone to mimic a menstrual cycle, albeit without the blood and pregnancy factor, and specifically for the mood changes and mental effects of menstruation that cis premenopausal women go through on a monthly basis. 

I'm 34, and a post op trans woman. My endocrinologist has me on 100 mg of progesterone that I take daily. I'm also interested in raising my dosssge to 200 mg. In addition to taking progesterone, I self inject estradiol valerate every two weeks, as proscribed by the endocrinologist. 

I read that some doctors recommend that trans women take progesterone for about two weeks and then afterwards they should go off of it for two weeks. Thereafter, the cycle begins anew. I wonder when would be the best time to cycle the progesterone to maximize the effects of it and the estradiol valerate: the week I administer my estradiol valerate injection or the weeks when I'm not injecting."
pixilsaturn,asktransgender,Is anyone else finding their sexuality fluctuating on hrt?,"Before HRT I belonged in the ""bicurious"" camp.

I found some guys cute. Never to the point of doing anything with them, outside of a little experimentation with my best friend a few times, which I never thought much of as I was single at the times that occured.

LuceIsOffline,asktransgender,I need advice. i'm coming out.,"This is not the original sub that I posted this on, but I was told that in regards to some of my issues and questions, that this may be a good place to ask.

Hey, so I’m going to give a basic rundown here, for better setup, and so that you can understand my situation better. I'm a guy. A paper white, skinny, tall, male. I’m 14. I’m in 7th grade (I started late and have a summer birthday). The school I’m going to is a catholic school. It’s not so bad. Very accepting. I am an atheist. This isn't what I'm coming out about, but it is kind of important for you to know so that you understand that I'm not at risk of being disowned or hated because of who I am. I'm an atheist and it's not a secret, my parents know it, my friends and peers know it, my teachers know it, hell even the principle knows it. None of them really care. They truly couldn't give a damn, it's just ""whatever"" to them. And this is just how accepting everyone is. My parents are liberal, and as such I knew that they wouldn't be upset. I had thought that my new religious school and classmates would be, but they didn't care, like I said. The teachers, while some of them disagree with it and have their own beliefs as to my judgment, I'm sure, are not persecuting to me about it and don't try to make me repent or feel bad. My friends, don't believe that I will be punished or anything like that. While they are religious, they aren't archaic about it, and most don't even believe in hell. Now, I'm also openly ""not straight"". I'm pansexual. I like everyone. But as far as my friends are concerned I'm just not straight or am just bi. I've asked out 2 girls before (failed both times), and don't try and hide my interest for any of the sexy guys the girls swoon over. I've only ever said that I didn't just like girls. I haven't really told them the label for it, but it doesn't matter. Everyone knows that I'm pansexual, no one really cares, I don't care, it's all great. Except for one issue. Well, more like two actually. My parents. They don't know. I've jsut never really felt up for telling them. I once hinted at it when saying that this would be the year of school in which I'd actually consider dating and going out with someone. I kept it purposefully vague as to the gender. I didn't say I was going to ask girls out or have a boyfriend. They both asked me about that and both said that they loved me and wouldn't mind. I said the same thing to both of them, that with all do respect, it wasn't necessarily their business. And they accepted it and that was it. This was of course before I'd come out about being pansexual to everyone, and still felt a bit timid about people knowing. Okay, I have to make a quick pause. I have a plan. I am coming out. And I'm doing it in a way that I'm proud of and think will work best for me. So I've been writing/drawing these pages with pictures/words on them. It's kind of supposed to be a 'parody' of a kids book, meaning that it kind of has that feel to it, where there's a large picture on every page illustrating the story. In this little book, is my coming out confession. It talks about alot of things. And in the end comes out about the three things I need to come out about. One is the pansexuality and to my parents. The other two I'll talk about after this little pause. I think that this way of coming out will work best for me because I'm a great writer. I talk best through written words than spoken. And this is a way that I can enjoy. Basically, my depression (yeah I have it, it sucks, but that's not what this is about) took away my passion for drawing years ago. And only recently am I getting it back. So the two things I love to do, writing and drawing, are helping me come out. I don't want this to be something I hate. I'm going to come out through words and color. Anyway that's all, quick pause over. The main thing that I'm coming out about, is something I've only told three people. I'm genderfluid. And it really sucks ass. Atleast if your trans, you can try and transition, and then it's all fixed. For me, whether or not I feel like a guy or girl, isn't some stagnant thing. It changes. And it fucking sucks so god damn much. If I could have one wish, that had to be focused solely on me... What I would give to be able to change sex when I feel like it... Anyway, sorry I just, it stinks. It really does. But like I said, only three people know. My bestfriend, I'd trust her with anything. Another friend who is transgender and kind of gets my plight. And then a new friend that I've made this year, I've told her a lot and we're really close. All three of these people that I've told, are all accepting of me. I'm not afraid to come out to my friends, well, I am, but not like a lot. My teachers, I really couldn't give a shit about what they think honestly. My parents, I know that they'd accept it, eventually. But, there's all this confusion going on. There's so many genders and sexualities and some are overly specific, some mean the exact same thing as others, some have multiple meanings that each claim is the right one. It's confusing. I get it. And there's the whole 'Transtrender' bull shit that comes with it. Suddenly everyone isn't just fit neatly into the whole binary area and everyone is different. A lot of people are a bit stigmatic towards all of this. My parents are. I think that if I said that I was genderfluid that they wouldn't take me seriously at first. I think that they would in the end. But perhaps the scariest thing, and the hardest for me to come out about. is wanting to transition. And this is kind of the thing I wanted to talk about. I came to the conclusion girls where better than guys along time ago. I can prove it through anatomy, history, society, a lot of things. While men are stronger then women on average, women can do things men can't. Women can give birth for one (just to be clear I know if I transitioned to a girl I wouldn't be able to give birth, nor would I want to, I can't stand pain and don't want to be a parent). I'll gloss over the fact of how women and orgasms work... And of course women do have to deal with periods, which, just... Respect, okay, respect. In history women have proven to be more accepting and generous. I could go on, but don't feel like it. I've always gotten along with girls slightly better than guys. And I find that if I fantasize about men (which is usually when my genderfluidism appears, sexually) I'm more often the girl with a guy than the guy with another guy. I've given it a lot of thought. And I want to be a girl. I'll be happier being constantly female than constantly male. And I know that at some point I'll begin to feel like a guy, because I'm genderfluid and it changes. But I think I'm okay with that. It's the sacrifice I'll make to be happy. I can't change when I want, so I'll change to what I want most. This is going to be the scariest to com out about. To everyone. And that's it. That's everything. All I want is some advice. Some opinions on all of this. What I'm going through. What I'm going to do. And most importantly, advice about transitioning. I've tried researching it, but couldn't find anything that answered my questions exactly. I'm going to put a list of questions I have below. This is a really long thing to read. And if you read it all, thank you. Would you be even kinder, and maybe help me out? I don't really have anyone to ask these things or to talk about this stuff with. So, if you do respond and help me.. God, I, I can't say how much it will mean to me. But, if you do, than thank you. Thank you so much. How does the voice work? I have a deep voice. I've been thinking on it, but this is the only conclusion: If one undergoes transitioning before puberty or during early puberty, their voice won't get deeper and they won't sound like a boy. If one goes through transitioning after puberty or during (to the point where it's to far to matter), than their voice will remain male sounding and they'll have to use a fake voice to sound like a girl. I don't think that's right, it's just what I've pieced together. I really don't want to have to pretend to sound like a girl. So how does it work? How long will it take? I know that it varies upon age and body and a lot of other things as well. But how long might it take for me? What will it all be like?"
Texas-Kangaroo-Rat,asktransgender,Do you even need a birth certificate for anything?,"Like there's a legal clinic tomorrow for getting pro bono help on court gender change, but like that'd literally only really be good for birth certificate, which since I'm doing the passport thing, everything else is unnecessary.

Is there anything you'd need a birth certificate for? should I even bother?"
Peter__D,asktransgender,How should I start MtF voice training?,"I've seen a lot of posts about MtF voice training lately, and I've seen people talk about how you shouldn't be tightening your vocal cords to speak in a femme voice, but that it should be other factors you use to feminized your voice. However, all the videos I've watched on voice feminization have taught tightening the vocal cords.

Does anyone want to explain the proper way that I should go about training my voice? A link to a video would really help. 

Thanks! "
Anxietygirl661,asktransgender,My girlfriend's behavior has become really strange since we both began to transition and I'm unsure why?,"Hi! I'm hoping this is okay to post here, if not, I'm sorry! Just let me know and I'll delete it. 

I'm MtF and so is my girlfriend. We've known each other well over eight years and dated for four of them. We're both 26 and chose to transition together when we discovered we were transgender. 

We're both going the same route in the UK which is through the NHS. Both on hormones, though I've been on mine for a year and she has been on hers 4 months.

Since getting on hormones, my girlfriend has started to act oddly. She has completely 'dumbed' herself down. She's incredibly intelligent, but since starting hormones she just has no opinion on anything and if it's not makeup or clothing, she pretends she doesn't understand because she's 'Just a silly girl'. For instance, I told her I was going to go back to the gym to lift weights and build some lean muscle, as I'm lucky that I'm very petite and girly looking, even before I began my hormones, so I'd like to kind of get a more lean, stronger feminine figure if that makes sense. Plus I really love weight lifting!

To which my girl replied in a text:

'When you talk about macho guy things my brain switches off and I just nod. I'm just a girl I don't know about weights and things, those are guy activities'

I told her that loads of women lift and she just put 'Nope. It's a male thing. I'm just a little girl. I don't know anything.' 

We used to have really meaningful discussions about all kinds of things, but now she just tells me she doesn't know about that 'man stuff' and that 'girls don't talk about politics' or 'My job is to be in the kitchen, I leave the men to talk about movies' and so on. It's really strange.

I know that she is probably trying to not associate with supposedly masculine things, but this is ridiculous. She also still refers to me as her 'man' and tells me things like 'When you go to the gym you will get sexy pecs. I can't wait.' I told her that this made me really uncomfortable to be referred to as her man and her sexualizing my male features, to which she got angry and told me 'It's not my fault I like what I like.' and wouldn't apologise, she simply carried on saying I was her man and how sexy I'd look with muscles. 

We're still sexually active, but we've always been respectful of one another, now she's totally thrown that out the window and keeps telling me how sexy my genitals are and how she wants to get pregnant by me. I know this is physically impossible, as she doesn't have the reproductive organs, but it makes me really uncomfortable to be masculinised by her so much. Last time she began talking like this I told her to stop and went to get up, but she stopped me and wouldn't let me go until she'd 'satisfied her man'. which I did not want. To be honest it made me feel sick and I feel awful about that because she's my girlfriend and I shouldn't feel that way, but I didn't want sex at that time when she was saying these things and she forced me anyway.

Recently she's told me she wants to quit her job at an IT store because she's a girl and 'shouldn't know about these things'. Her manager is my friend, and gave her a job when she really badly needed one, and he's askd me if I could have a word with her about her refusal to do her job. She apparently keeps saying she doesn't know how to do things with computers because she's a girl. She's actually at risk of getting fired, because she's had three disciplinary actions about it, as shes even telling customers she's just there to answer the phone and look pretty. 

When I asked her what job she'd like to do, she said 'Having babies and cooking for my man.' and pointed at me. It's just...super strange and she's making me uncomfortable by misgendering me all the time. 

Am I just not being sympathetic to her? I'm trying, I really am, but she's not making it easy at all. :( I feel so awful for feeling like this, but some of it really upsets me and has been triggering my own dysphoria.

RCady,asktransgender,Would Transgenders feel motivation to change if humanity's idea of stereotypical male and female behavior changed?,"Hi there everyone! I've never been in here and this question kind of popped into my head today and I thought it was very interesting. Basically I would just like to understand more on what drives the motivation to change your physical sex.

Anyway, the title pretty much says it all.

I'm just curious if humanity as a whole discarded their normal beliefs of how males and females should behave, would the transgender community still feel motivated to change their physical sex?

Thanks everyone!"
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I encountered two weird social situations today and I'm not sure what to think about it.,"As in title, I have encountered two situations that I never had before.

First one was at the park, on my way to the shop I got tired so I decided to sit down. UK folks will know how hard it can be when you have to climb up everywhere. So I sat down in a park and were texting my friend, when some guy came (he was running) and asked if I'm alone and stuff. I freaked out and ran away, even though he was nice. But I don't really pass, and in a total boymode so it's impossible that he was hitting on me... Was he? Well, he could be gay but who knows.

Second one was actually at the shop, two kids were running around with toys (swords from Star Wars), and I was shopping for groceries. I heard running behind me, kid ran by, gave me the sword, said ""hold it for a second"" and ran, when second kid came and wanted to fight with me. I was like ""well, okay, I don't know how to use it but whatever"". So I pretended to fight with him, he lightly hit me in a kidney and I said ""Oh nooo, I'm dead"". Then returned the sword and said ""sorry boys, but I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars"". Then I smiled and they left laughing."
transthrowerrata,asktransgender,Early Transitioners: When did you get SRS?,"Are there any other early transitioners over here? If yes, then when did you get SRS?

I'm MtF, started HRT in my early teens and transitioned in my teens. A decade later, I'm in my twenties and I haven't had SRS yet due to financial reasons. I'm wondering how common this is. Did anyone else over here transition early and do SRS later? What was your timeline?"
YayScience120,asktransgender,DAE have a weird mixture of shame and pride?,"I'm FTM and have been on hormones for a few months now. It's been a long, emotional journey to get here, full of crippling self-doubt and joyless depression.

One part of me is proud that I have fought to get this far, for the simple right of being able to be myself. And surreally happy that somehow I was able to achieve this. Sometimes I am in sheer overwhelming awe of the fact that I ended up here, to the point that I feel like crying from bittersweet happiness. 

Then there's another part of me that sees all the negative media attention and notices when other people give me strange looks because they can't figure out what gender I am. The part of me that is self-conscious and ashamed, and just wishes I could be ""normal"" and automatically accepted as a man rather than a freak. I wish I could simply be proud of myself, but there's a part of me deep down that is ashamed of who I am and the circumstances of my birth.

DAE relate to this?"
[deleted],asktransgender,"FtMs, how do you feel about your masculinity?","I have a few questions concerning masculinity. I am currently writing an essay on the topic but finding myself (a cis man) to be intellectualising everything and losing distance from how it feels to be a trans man. I think that it is important that whilst I am studying this I don't glance over trans masculine identity by simply fitting it into neat theoretical categories.

So, my questions for you are these:

For you, does your feeling of being a man make you a man?

For you, does your acting like a man make you a man?

For you, does your having/not having a penis make you a man?

For you, does your having/not having a penis make you feel or act more/less like a man?

I suppose the answer to all of these will be a mixture and all connected but I wanted to grasp the relationship between feeling, acting and 'the phallus'. These questions are specifically aimed at **how it feels for you** and apply to anyone at any stage of transition. I apologise in advance if my questions are inappropriate or patronising. If that is the case then please let me know and I will either fix my questions or delete the post. 

Thank you in advance.

I've been completely stale emotionally and the most stoic fuck ever I really must not be happy.  tearing up thinking how even if I transition ill never be AFAB. How can i be a female when I'm the depiction of typical nerd guy slob, nobody will believe me and i'll just be another pervert that want to go in the woman washroom. Feeling disgusted by my genital and dreaming of SRS. Masturbating; well i must not be that disgusted by it since I've been playing with it.

all that complemented by a natural compassion for people and seeing how i have it easy in life overall over most people, trans or not, i really have no right to complain and wanting to transition is just me being selfish.

meinmyhead,asktransgender,MTF Hormone Levels,"Hello /r/asktransgender!

I recently got back my blood tests 7mo after starting HRT. My testosterone was at 4.1 nmol/l and estrogen at 302 pmol/l (down from about 320 a few months before). I'm on finasteride pills and estradiol patches. How are those levels? I can't find any decent resources online as to what the expected range for levels are for trans hormone treatment (I'm sure I've seen people saying like triple that E level tho) and I don't really feel like much has changed at all. :x

Also, I keep reading people anecdotally talking about progesterone. Is that a thing? (A thing backed up by evidence?)

(I'm getting a little down since I've basically gone a year since I snapped and started trying to get HRT and nothing seems to be happening - I'm 26.)"
Baconof,asktransgender,What does this mean?,"For the past few years I've been wanting to transition and having fantasies about it, both sexual and non sexual. After almost getting a therapist I decided to push transitioning to the back of my mind. The reasons are that everyone in my life is against it and I don't want to lose those people if I did it. But lately I've been thinking about transitioning again and how happy I would be. Thinking about it even makes me happy. What could this all mean? I know it's very difficult to figure out if I'm trans or not or maybe gender fluid. Any ideas? People always tell me to see a specialist but that's not really something easily available for me to do right now to figure it out"
Fap_Doctor,asktransgender,TW: Just me ranting,"It's just a lot of misgendering. Mostly just emotionally numb from it. I'm sitting here, waiting for the Women's Health to call back for my GRS consult.

I don't get why keep spewing hateful things, keep doing it til I get pissed then claim I started things. So, I am just sitting here, waiting for the time to leave for work and I dread my days off. I barely have any motivation to clean my room and get yelled at every single day for being trans. I could live on my own in a apartment, I wouldn't be able to afford food at all.

I've been told that I will regret my decision after GRS. Which is not true as they (meaning family) base their opinion on people who had regrets when GRS happened and not include people who is very happy with their new bits. They want me to meet with a girl, have kids and live in a fancy place. I don't see myself doing that at all. I see myself dating/marrying a girl I am friends with, adopting kids or living/marrying my bf and adopt. They said I never shown I wanted to be a girl when I was growing up. I didn't know if I would have been outcasted or kicked out then, thus I never mentioned it and my sister knew for a long time.

Clarine87,asktransgender,"Whats it like being FtM, on T, closeted, and thus presenting female?","Including pronouns, name, hair, voice(?) etc.

Due to that strange presumption that transmen can start presenting their desired gender sooner than transwomen because the ""stigma and risks of non passing are much less"" we don't hear much about those transmen on T which *are* closeted.

For reference here when I say closeted I mean when presenting as your assigned gender in day to day life after commencing tHRT.

[*Binary*] transwomen talk all the time about going as assigned gender until that becomes untenable, but transmen are perceived to start their transition in a barbershop and 'present' male immediately, but because of this perception we don't hear much about it.

I am genuinely interested to hear the other side, so while we MtF talk about hiding boobs, growing out hair, shaving non-masc hairs, and other stuff while presenting outwardly male. What do FtM do when closeted, on T, and presenting as female?

See I can't even imagine what the otherside does to keep their HRT and comfort rituals discrete because I can't think what those rituals or obvious hrt effects might be. :S"

I am a nonbinary AFAB person who's pretty masculine-leaning, I'm going on low-dose T pretty soon (yay!) and am planning on getting top surgery this summer. However, I've run into some pretty specific complications and would really appreciate some advice...
So my mom died pretty early from breast cancer despite best efforts+a mastectomy and I'm about half her age now, so naturally I'm pretty spooked. My old man's been real cool about me being trans and also understanding about my cancer-related fears so he's also REALLY on board with helping me in my transition, thank god. I brought up top surgery the other day and he suggested that we also look into a preventative mastectomy with ""male"" chest reconstruction instead of ""female"" so that our insurance is more willing to cover it. I'm lucky enough to be in a state where my insurance will already cover a bunch of transition-related expenses, and I'm worried that if I go with a surgeon who is unfamiliar with the situation of a trans person seeking chest surgery I'll get some...weird results. Like, in my experience, those surgeons are used to cis women who just can't bear to lose their breasts instead of a trans person who conveniently wants a flat chest as well as to not die of cancer. That is, if i even will be able to present myself as anything but a cis woman for that particular surgery to go well. Pa's pretty optimistic about our options for the mastectomy, but I'm also still sort of teaching him about the world of being trans and he doesn't know a ton about how FtM top surgery works yet. I want the process to be as easy as possible for my family and obviously the more I can get covered by insurance the better, but I also would be pretty damn upset if my experience of surgery was stressful and had results I wasn't happy with, u kno?"

I have problems thinking, always had. It isn't that I'm lacking intelligence - quite the contrary. But I have problems with simple life things. Writing letters, presenting my work to others, organizing my day, comprehending things that are obvious to others. It feels like my brain is blocked. I'm inert, have problems shifting my focus. Most of the time don't feel a thing, except anxiety and insecurity. I don't understand other people and am not understood. I don't care about anything. It all seems so random, it doesn't affect me.

I have no motivation for anything, never had. The only times I ever wanted something where when I had serious health problems and wanted to get healthy again and wanting to be a girl.

I'm drifting trough life with no direction and I don't care. And when the waves throw me against the cliffs I don't feel a thing.

Sorry for pulling things down. But what I wanted to know is, did anyone of you feel the same? Did it get better with transition?

I wonder if I am putting myself in a great danger for this. Should I stop taking sublingual 2~3 days prior to my new shot?."

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,"Im having a lot of issues with my femininity being nothing more than submissiveness and i need help...help me, please x(","TL;DR being a woman feels shameful and submissive and idk what to do, yet i want to be submissive. But it goes to far, makes me seek validation from others and all i get is doubts and chiding. Cant be a fully fledged human for myself. Women seem to all accept their servitude. How do i be a ""single woman who dont need no man"", without giving up my submissive tendencies, without sacrificing my self xp

I know i sound like someone a bit in the red pill but thats what i see, women being emotionally used by men.  The only things that stips men from having their way with women is good conscience and the law. Men are dominance gender-fied.  And perhaps rightfully so, men feel threatened by the law giving women disproportionate power. Men are losing their natural essence, their manliness. They cant step on womens toes or they mighr get accused of sexual harassment. This isnt me by the way, but i feel i habe some undeniable masculinity in me that while i dint identify with it, its there, socially learned or perhaps innate.

This chapter of this [NSFW] sex story i.literotica.com/stories/showstory.php?id=1192625 describes me almost perfectly, and it shames me, and scares me. i know its not real, i mean, 14 inches...thats unhealthy, but it borders on the edge of reality and thus feels realostic and affects me thusly, because if the similar desires i have and feelings it evokes.  But i don't want to be a housewife, a trophy, a glorified pet xp but i do...but its just a fantasy...how can i be realistic about my femininity and transition in a healthy way. I mean i consider myself a feminist ffs, yet i want to be contrilled, i struggle to make decisions for myself, i want a man to tell me im a woman because i seek validation and cant tell it to myself. I feel like the princess stuck in the castle of her mind, and yet all those stories are the antithesis, total opposite of what feminists strive for.  And i get such shameful feelings.

I feel like all i am is a ""beta"" male. And i worry i just want to validate my submissiveness by being female. I feel ashamed around men.  Strangely men were jealous because i could get girls interest easier--i think thats just because i had a cutish fsce and used a bit of comedic bit of self degredation that got some girls interested.  I want to be emasculated, and yet thats the worst thing that can happen to a man (see Theon Greyjoy, or Tye Spider)..but im not a man...but biology feels much more true than feelings, because its so apparent, so in reality wheras feelings are ethereal flowy nothingness.

But i habe issues because people can luterally contril me with their words. I let them, i guess..but its like it happens because idk. Too unsure of myself? No self esteem?

Men, generally speaking, seem to see the female gender as lesser. Idk. Thats a broad generalization. But leading from that, theres the nsfw sex story, and while not all men are like that..its what i want, but growing uo around men, i simultabeously both desire it and feel sick to my stomach"

I've been seeing a 19 year old guy for the past few weeks and I actually quite like them. They're feminine in both personality and appearance, and really just a super sweet 'sad boy' (aka my type if we're being totally honest here). Thing is, I'm pretty sure they're trans. A lot of what they say resonates and are things I said when I couldn't admit to myself I was a trans woman. I mentioned that I hate my voice and they started going on about how they hate hearing theirs, how they wish it was different and the only thing they even sort of like about it is that they can sing. They talk about how emotionally, they can't relate to any guy guys. How they like butch girl clothes, that they're ugly because they 'cant' wear makeup, that they like how feminine their body is, etc. This was me.
I don't know what to do. Whether they end up my boyfriend or my girlfriend is a non issue, I just want to help them be happy and express themselves. I don't want to be like 'hey dude, you're trans' and drive them away or assume anything about them, I already sort of pushed the subject a little and they gave pretty much the answer I did when I was where they were ""im not a guy guy but I guess im not a girl"""

**How I started questioning** 

&amp;nbsp;

I really started questioning properly on 21st of October 2016. Very strange day that was. It was like any other day, I went to college, went home, but something kinda clicked into place at like 8PM that I might be trans. I somehow ended up watching one of Stef Senjati's videos on YouTube. Watching her made everything click into place. If it wasn't for Stef Senjati, I probably wouldn't of discovered this part of myself (thanks stef!).



**What happened after initially finding out** 

&amp;nbsp;

It was right before half term (it is a week you have off school between one term of school, typically every 1.5 months). I had a strange, almost ""euphoric"" period. I was all like ""Yeah, after half term I'm going to go back as a girl"". How wrong I was thinking I could just do that. I remember picking out outfits online with the intent do start going back as a girl.  I was pretty much happy that I discovered who I am, but that only lasted a week


Then in November, I went back to Sixth Form. It was very strange, the feelings of wanting to be a girl completely went, and I only ever had them at weekends (when I had 2 days off) That then went to every time I was alone in my room.


Towards the end of November I started getting really angry about being AMAB and not AFAB. It was anger. However, that anger started turning into suicidal thoughts by December. I stopped caring about my a-levels, and my life in general. I still don't, I got an assignment due in tomorrow which I have no intention of doing.


When I had time off in December for Xmas, things got so bad. I felt like killing myself. This is still only when I am alone, however. All I could think about is how much better my life would of been if I were female. I almost dreaded seeing family on Christmas Day as male, but when it came to it was actually OK. Although that entire day all I'd think about is being trans.


In January, things went back to normal after xmas. I still felt a little suicidal, but again, only like it was is in November. Not that bad I guess.

**Now** 
&amp;nbsp;

It's now February, almost March. Just finished another half term, and towards the end I was getting suicidal. I'm going to my GP in a couple of weeks to get a referral to a GIC, and it's the most anxious I've ever been about something. I now have no idea what I want to be. Do I want to continue living as male, live as female, or somewhere in between? I have no fucking clue anymore. In the past being AMAB was what made me suicidal, but now it's because I 




Time has moved so fast, almost frighteningly fast since I started questioning. The time between 21st June - 21st October feels so much longer, even though it was the same amount of time. It almost feels like only 1 month has passed in comparison.

Last Friday, I just had my first laser appointment! Yay! But despite a very slight reduction in hair, I'm not seeing reduction at the level I was hoping. I still have to shave pretty much every day right now in order to keep a smooth face, and shaving itself is an activity that makes me feel pretty dysphoric. Having to look at my face in the mirror that long kind of has that tendency, as my hairline has also been receding at a faster pace as of late, and just in general I see the maleness in my face. 

I know that in order to see long-term results, you need to have at least a few sessions under your belt. I have reddish-brown and black facial hair and a very light complexion, which I've heard is generally good for laser. My hair is very thick and coarse though, so I know that's also a factor. What kind of results can I expect long-term? "

This is the first time I've ever entertained the idea of wearing women's clothing; and I was kind of apprehensive about even browsing skirts. At least I was until I found that Amazon don't gift wrap skirts, or even sell them in the size I wanted, then I just got mildly frustrated.


I eventually branched out, but the bullet and ordered a size 16 burgundy dress, gift wrapped, to my office. 


Its odd. I've been feeling anxious almost to the point of nausea ever since I started questioning myself, but now I've actually got a real dress on its way to me, I feel fine.


My plan for when the dress arrives is to try it on and see how I feel in it. Both away from and in front of a mirror.

Is it possible for them to grow more?

Malimestar,asktransgender,Internalised transphobia or fear of being male?,"Hey people, this question is intended for MTFs but enyone who can relate is wellcome to answer. 
So I have 25 years, and for those 25 years I lived as happy guy. I was closeted gay - acting straight and having girls made me feel comfortable but never fulfilled. When I came out I still considered my self as man and was extremly happy, until one night when I was high on weed question just popped (am I woman?). It's been 3 months now and I am still totaly confused about gender dysphoria and gender identity. I feel I lack masculinity and I feel weak even dough I am 6f4in 94kg (big guy ��) I would like to have stronger arms six pack bigger penis but all of my insecurities make me question if I am trans. I allways dreamed of being bottom since I was in active role in straight relationship, when I see my body it resembles me of womans and it makes me uncomfortable (I have wider hips and soft skin). My biggest problem is fear. I think I am less of a man since I get scared for no reason. For example when I am in bed with my partner even dough I get hard I don't have that manly sex drive I can fuck but I don't feel confident enough since no matter how much he tells me I am big enough I think my penis is small (6'4"") and I don't know how do I feel about it, it's like it would be easier to have vagina and that I would not have to think about how small it is. But those that make me trans? I don't have clear perception of my self, only for the last few days I got the idea of me as male in society and it gave some kind of self confidence but when I am alone I don't know how I feel about my self like it's easier to be woman than to overcome my fear of being man. I can't imagine my self as woman, but I am not sure if I can tell for my self I am man. Yet I am not sure is this fear problem made me question my gender since I have became what I am mostly because I was avoiding social situations where I can get into any conflict. When I get adrenalin rush I freeze my heart rate grows up and I shut down and I don't know if that makes me woman."
askingquestions1231,asktransgender,Is the brain of transgender people built to recognize different hormone levels?,"I keep hearing people claiming that the brain of a transgender person is built to recognize the hormone levels of the opposite sex, which could cause depression and other things on its own, even apart from normal body/social dysphoria.

TrickyCharlotte,asktransgender,I'm not sure where to go from here.,"I don't usually post as I tend to be a rather private person so please forgive me if I mess up on any etiquette. I guess I am going to be talking about a few issues that may trigger people so I will throw this warning in here as well.

So I am currently 10 months HRT MTF been on quite a high dose since the 2nd month and blood levels have been good for the most part the entire time except for one brief period where they were massively high.

I had been doing alright until recently where I have had this overwhelming sadness and hopelessness come over me. Basically previously I was quite successful as a guy. I was earning 80 k per year I had all the objects in the world I could want but I was still empty and it did nothing to cure the dysphoria.

I decided to transition in the vague hope that I might pass. Now I realize this may not be what some agree with or believe in but for me I have never had any want to be a  non-passing trans woman. I don't personally have anything against it and I wish I could do it myself but it's simply not in my makeup. I hate attention being drawn to me and I have an absolute meltdown when I am the center of attention.

I decided that if I was going to transition I would have to pass or I would still continue living as a guy. Which brings me to my current issue. I've not been very lucky with my transition thus far and I won't lie to you everyone, I have pretty much resigned myself at this point to the fact that I am stuck in this male shell.

The trouble is I don't know what to do from here, I can't end it because I have a partner who I am very much dedicated to and would do anything for but at the same time I am dying inside. 

How do I come to terms with the fact that despite HRT I will not be lucky enough to pass and thus will have to remain as I was when I started? I don't have any money to afford the surgeries that would be needed, even then there are some things that cannot be fixed with surgeries.

Then there is the issues I sometimes have with my partner, I love her so dearly but it's sometimes hard to be with someone that has all the things that you wish you had in your own body.

I don't know what I expect from this post tbh, I am not always the best at articulating how I feel but yeah pretty lost as to where I go from here. "

lmTheQ,asktransgender,What does it mean to be trans? Am I?,"I honestly feel really awkward even typing this out, but it has been on my mind for a while now so I guess I'll just ask. I think I am really trying to differentiate from being effeminate and trans.

I apologize in advance that this post is poorly formatted and kind of bounces all over.

So basically, I have always been uncomfortable with who I am. A large part of this comes from the fact that all of my interests are conventionally girly and I am jealous of the way girls get to live.

When I was a kid I remember wanting to do ballet, but my parents wouldn't let me. When I tried out for musicals I was always jealous I couldn't audition for any of the female roles. My first year of college I went to a drag show with my girlfriend and I was so excited I ended up putting on one of her dresses before it. I did it in a joking manner, but secretly I just really wanted to try it on. I have always been jealous of what girls get to wear and just the way they get to be in general. 

I feel like my life would have been so much easier if I was born a girl. Not because girls have an easier life, but because I feel like I would have more naturally been a girl. I like to giggle at movie and oggle at cute things. I wish I could have the kinds of relationships that I see girls have with one another, but I just feel like guys don't do that sort of thing. I have always fit in with girls more than guys.

The other thing that bothers me is I feel like most girls wouldn't want to be with a guy like this. I am really not manly at all. It is hard for me to date because it all feels like I am just putting up a front, but what girl is going to want to be with a guy that giggles at movies and crosses his legs. It's really frustrating not being able to be yourself though.

I don't know. You probably don't either because my post was all over the place. Maybe my post is misguided and stupid, but any thoughts? I don't think I would even have the courage to do anything about if I actually was trans, but I wish I could understand why I am this way."

missuniquorn,asktransgender,Anyone with Welsh NHS transitioned/transitioning?,"I began my transition in England then moved to Wales a year or so later, and in England it was pretty standard; I told my GP, got referred to the nearest Gender Clinic (I don't want to say which one but not Charing Cross) and went through the early stages there, which was all fine. However once I registered with a new GP in Wales I got told that because my Primary Care Trust changed when I moved area I was no longer able to go to my old GIC and would have to go through the Welsh system. This then involved being referred to a local psychiatrist in my town who knew basically nothing about trans stuff, and then getting another referral to a different 'expert' about an hour and a half away from my town, who would then refer me to Charing Cross.

Luckily I was already on hormones and my Welsh GP kept prescribing me them so I wasnt overly worried, and I have since moved back to England so will be able to continue as before. However I was wondering if any of you have transitioned in Wales, and what your experiences were like? And also as I may move back to Wales in a couple of years if you have any advice of an easier method than all the referrals!

TL;DR I moved from England to Wales mid-transition, and the Welsh Healthcare system for trans people seemed more complex and took more time than the English one. Any thoughts/experiences/advice?"

Does anyone have experience with changing your gender marker on all government documents and how this might and or could affect your marriage certificate obtained in NC?

Even if you are not a current resident in NC, but simply got married there, I would appreciate any insight into your experience."
genderfluidchick1989,asktransgender,Could I actually be binary trans? [Could become slightly NSFW],"I've thought for a while that I'm actually more genderfluid than binary trans. Like, the idea of saying ""I'm a trans woman"" didn't appeal to me.

The other night I was thinking, and the more I was thinking, the more that ""If that makes me one, then I'm a girl"" kept coming up.

First of all, I've never felt truly like ""one of the guys"" when hanging out in single gender groups. Not that I've always hated hanging out in groups of only guys, just that I've never truly liked considering myself ""one of the guys.""

Another, I tend to prefer hanging around girls, being involved in whatever discussion they're having. I just feel kinda stupid for wanting to discuss makeup and fashion and girl ""stuff"" just because I am seen, typically, as ""one of the guys"" due to my physical appearance.

Another, kinda NSFW, I am attracted to women, but I don't want to be the man in a sexual relationship. I've never really thought of using my penis in a traditional sense for sex. I even tend to describe my sexuality as more ""lesbian"" than ""straight guy.""

Also, when I get more dressed up in a feminine manner, I like it a lot more than when I get dressed up in a masculine manner, even if I am dressed up masculine and people say I look nice. I feel better in more feminine attire.

Also, lastly, I've thought many, many times that if I woke up and had a girl's body, I'd be ecstatic.

So, basically I've never seen myself as ""one of the guys."" I tend to actually like the idea of being around closer girl friends than guy friends. I tend to not picture myself as the man in a relationship involving a woman. I tend to strongly prefer more feminine attire, even when told more masculine attire looks really good on me. I also can, at times, want to wake up in a girl's body. Does that sound like it makes me more binary trans? Does that make me sound like a woman? Could I really not be a guy at all?"

Clarine87,asktransgender,"If a person is misdiagnosed or otherwise comes to transition socially (and/or medically) through the binary genders, and they are in fact thus cisgender - is it detransitioning when they revert and should they be counted as such?","**TL;DR Can cisgender people detransition?** And when they do, should they be counted alongside transgender people which do when in fact their transition ought not have occurred.

This community has given me the impression that ""detransition"" is something which only transpeople do - is it fair to conflagrate cisgender people which went through transition for whatever reason and then detransitioned with transpeople which detransition for whatever reason?

I've noticed a worrying trend of media reports of people which ""de-transition"" failing to acknowledge the **gender identity** of the person in question, often going by their assigned gender, but completely ignoring the question of whether the person is transgender or not.

I was reading this article:
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/03/experience-i-regret-transitioning
7th paragraph:
&gt;At the same time, there was a significant change in how I felt about my gender. Reflecting on the difference in how I was treated when people saw me as a man, I realised other women were also held back by this. I had assumed the problem was in my body. Now I saw that it wasn’t being female that was stopping me from being myself; it was society’s perpetual oppression of women. Once I realised this, I gradually came to the conclusion that I had to **detransition**.

I appreciate that by definition the bolded word is used correctly - but should a person be counted as ""de-transition"" if they're cisgender?

This particular article completely skates around whether this person is transgender or not, but solidly refers to them(FtMtF) as ""she"".

I think its reckless of the media to cast doubt on transitioning without stating whether the subjects of these types of articles were diagnosed (self or otherwise) correctly or not. 

People detransition for lots of reasons which should not be stigmatised or presented as counter arguments to prospective transgender people looking for help - should those that detransition because they're actually cisgender be counted alongside those that are transgender and detransition for their own reasons?

They may be a warning against misdiagnosis - but not against transition itself as a course of treatment IMO.


NOTE:

Use of ""binary"" in the title is merely there to simplify the question's meaning."

i put on my new leggings, flannel, perfected my lipstick, and left. i was really, really nervous. i never go out in more of a ""girl mode"" because i'm always so self-concuious and i'm always afraid of getting hurt. i got to church and so did my coworker and we stayed through service.

does it ever get easier? it feels amazing when i get to see myself as i know i'm supposed to, especially in an outfit that i love. does it get easier to deal with the fact that people are going to be on to me? that people are going to know i'm trans? i wish so bad that people would just see the woman i am as i see me, no matter what."
abbxrdy,asktransgender,[MTF] For those of us with daughters: Do you worry that guiding them through life will hurt you?,"This hurts to write, and I feel like a shitty person for even thinking it, but it's always in the back of my mind. My daughter is 2 and I worry that as she grows up, I'll be envious that she gets to have a normal life and experience things that when I was younger I could only sit from a distance and watch. 

I'm afraid that when she starts grade school, it's going to dredge up bad memories and that could affect my duties as a parent.  It's one of the central reasons I decided to pursue transition. 

I figure that in order to get over my past and deal with my present misery I have to own my situation and deal with it. I certainly can't be a good parent if I'm suffering with crippling dysphoria and thinking about suicide all the time.

I'm doing a lot better after 7 months of therapy and a month and a half of HRT. I'm hoping that as I slowly morph into the woman I should have always been that I'll get over the envy I get when I see other people who didn't have to deal with all this, and get over the crap I suffered with in the past. I have a son on the way too and I worry about him not getting to grow up having a dad...

So, how has parenting been for other transwomen? Are my fears unfounded?"

Why I always felt so sick? Was I depressed?

I sincerely don't know anymore if that is something related to gender dysphoria, or something else. I just don't know. It was bad, I felt sick, and life was difficult.

2nixruu,asktransgender,"Apparently I ""require a referral from my primary care physician"" to see the nearest IC doctor, best next steps for HRT?","So I gave the nearest IC doctor who has recommendations from Transgender patients, and I am told that as long as I'm not a patient at this clinic, I require a referral from my primary care physician to schedule an appointment.

Getting a referral is not really going to work for me right now--the current pcp I have on file I haven't seen in 6-7 years, and works about 350 miles away. For all I know he's retired by now, and knowing my parents in their decision to choose him over other physicians in the area, he's probably not the most likely individual to write a recommendation that will eventually lead me to hormone therapy. I could get another one, but my company insurance doesn't kick in until just a bit later.

I need to know what the best course of action from here is. Without a referral, IC is not going to be doable--outside of the nearby IC doctor, the next nearest is about 4 and a half hours' drive away, and I am not spending that time just to go see a doctor.

My options as I see it so far are:

1. I can go the therapy route. I would need a recommendation for a good therapist in my area who I could visit for gender therapy. Not interested in a gatekeepery type of person (obv) and not looking for someone that's going to take weeks to get me to getting HRT. 2-3 visits is about what I want before I can start making next steps.

2. I can find some way to get a referral for this IC clinic. I don't know how, (ideally someone could explain it to me) but I wonder if there would be some other way to get a referral without too much headache.

3. I can try to get a new pcp. This would mean that I need to start seeing a brand new doctor without usable insurance and then immediately get a recommendation for HRT. It sounds very unlikely and might take a very long time to make any progress.

Therapy sounds like it would be the easiest, apart from having to find someone in my area that can do it without having to do a 3 hour drive each time I want to visit them. But therapy could potentially be slow. I understand that it could be a little while under any option to get HRT, but the less time in limbo or spending time in appointments the better.

What would be the best recommendation for the route to go from here to get on HRT? Some combination of most painless and fastest would fit what I'm looking for best.

QUICK EDIT: I should mention that even though my insurance doesn't kick in for a little while, one of my company benefits is essentially a service that allows you to call a line with qualified doctors, tell them your symptoms, and then they can write you a prescription for certain medication. It's kinda like WebMD but by phone (which sounds sketchy but is actually quite well rated and reputable). I don't know if this service could help at all in this case, but I feel like it's worth mentioning just in case."

ryannefromTX,asktransgender,So here's what's happening in my world (long 1:30 AM ramble,"Well, my mom's dead.  That might be a good place to start this story.

It's 1:30 AM and I have to wake up and catch a plane back to Texas in two hours.  So I'm probably not gonna bother sleeping at all at this point.

I've been on hormones for 9 months, an actually ADEQUATE dose of hormones for about 6.  I've male failed a couple of times, but the facial hair is killing me.  Eight laser sessions, four hours of electrolysis - over $800 in cost - and I still have that telltale beard shadow that can't be covered up.  I've more or less given up on presenting female because the beard is just too strong of a giveaway, even more so, I think, than my 6'2"" height and my 50"" rib cage.

Then at the end of January, I get an email out of nowhere from my uncle.  ""Your mom has cancer, and the doctor's given her about two weeks to live.""

Now, I should probably mention that I'm not close to my family.  I don't talk to them a lot, for a whole lot of reasons - none of them trans-related, so it's not a ""hate my cross-dressing son"" thing.  I hadn't spoken to my mother at all other than the occasional email for about 10 years at this point, if that gives you an idea.  Sucks, but ""coming out to the family"" was a stress that I thankfully have never had to deal with.

So I fly back to where I grew up.  For the first time in a decade.

I wound up staying with my mom's long time boyfriend of 20 years.  I generally refer to him as my stepdad, even though they were never legally married.  He's a country-born, white-bred, deer-hunting, truck-driving, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, hardcore Republican.  Look up ""Trump Supporter"" in the dictionary and it's him.  Trump sign was still in his yard when I got there too.  I did my best not to get too pissed off at his political bullshit for my mom's sake, and he was courteous enough to turn off Fox News and not talk about politics when I was around, at least.

I probably don't need to mention that I spent the whole week there in boymode.  Had to wear 2-3 shirts at all times to hide the blossoming tits, but I forgot to bring a razor with me and had a full goatee by day 3, so boymode was never compromised.

I saw my mom in the hospital, and she was ecstatic that I was there.  Gave her a hug for the first time in 10 years.  Started worrying about how I'd ever tell her I was trans, as the shock might quite literally kill her in her fragile state.

Never had to worry about it, as she quit breathing 3 days later.

Now remember, stepdad and mom were never legally married, and common law marriage doesn't exist in this state.  This made me her legal next of kin, and gave me the task of doing EVERYTHING.  Dealing with the funeral home, closing her bank accounts, filing death certificates, etc., always having to introduce myself as ""the only son"" and getting a little sad every time I did.  Stepdad paid for everything, but I had to sign all the papers.

Finally got everything finished today.  Needed too much coffee to get through it, hence why I'm still up at... now it's 2 AM.

Yesterday, stepdad told me he's planning on flying me out west this May to see​ the rest of my family and console each other and talk about mom and whatever families do.  I'll have been on HRT for a year by then.  Heh, maybe my name'll even be legally changed.

Or maybe not.

So what's my point here?

I just spent a week in boymode.  And really, it's just... easier.  SO much easier​.  And my mother's death, ironically, gives me the best chance I've ever had to start interacting with my family again, and I have no doubt they'll cut me off permanently if I ever come out.  I can't get rid of this beard so I can't even present female anyway.  I'm a head taller than everyone around me, male OR female, with a rib cage so huge that the boobs look kinda silly glued to it.  So passing will be nigh impossible.   And I genuinely won't ever be happy unless I pass; I know this isn't important to many folks, but it's important to me.  I'm transitioning because I want to be a girl, and IMO I'm not really a girl unless people see me as a girl and treat me as a girl.

I guess I'm just... I mean, I'm not gonna quit taking my HRT. It's just that family back in my life is another complication now.  And I don't know what I'm gonna do if I go through all this and the end result is a giant burly dude with an oddly soft face and a moderate case of gynecomastia. I'm gonna be 35 soon, and I feel like I'm running out of time to get the ""female experience"" I've been craving since I was little.

There's probably not much any of you can do about any of this.  But if you read all that... thanks.

And if you didn't...

TL;DR - Transition isn't going well and my mother just died, bringing family back into my life for the first time in a decade."

Galactic_SugarPunk,asktransgender,Hormones losing their effect?,"Hi all. So I've been on HRT for about a month and a half now. Things started off pretty great; better mood, more energy, less sex drive/boners, etc., but after about 3-4 weeks I started feeling like I was reverting back. My energy slowly went back to where it was and my mood gradually started dropping back down. I had my 1 month checkup with my endo on the 1st of the month, but things hadn't gotten to the point where I thought much of it then, so I didn't say anything. I was still having good days, so I figured it was just mood swings (which I did mention).

However, the ""reversion"" seems to have continued and in the last 5 days or so I've noticed my sex drive returning to what it was and the good days have mostly vanished (or rather, the ""good"" days are back to being ""meh"" days). I've also noticed, or rather haven't noticed, the supposed side effects of spiro, namely having to pee a lot (and I have been making sure that I'm staying hydrated, so I don't think it's from lack of fluid).

Is this normal? Is my body just going through a flux? Or is it maybe that my levels aren't right? I'm taking 100mg of spiro (50mg tablet morning, 50mg at night) and 4mg of estradiol (2mg tablet morning, 2mg at night), which is what my endo prescribed when I started. I had blood work done again at my 1 month checkup, but I haven't heard back about results (which I assumed meant things were fine, but now I don't know).

For a bit I started freaking out thinking that I wasn't actually trans, but after forcing myself to calm down and think (been doing some mindfulness practice lately), I reeaally don't feel that's the case. I think something else is going on, just not sure what."
mid-brow_undertones,asktransgender,How to come out to a friend,"So, I called my old college roommate with the intent of telling him I plan on transitioning, but before I got to it, he brought up a mutual friend who had transitioned a few months prior.  He said something to the extent of ""it really surprised me and I didn't see it coming.""  ""Isn't that ridiculous?""  And he kind of laughed it off as absurd.  He complimented me on getting her pronouns right, but said that people get too uptight about it.

After I prodded him a bit and explained how important pronouns were to them, he relented and reasserted that of course he supported the LGBTQ community and would work on using correct pronouns.  He just came off as really judgmental and it honestly felt like he viewed her as a freak.  I got scared and I didn't say anything about my plan to transition after all.

This guy is my best friend and I love him a lot (like, our relationship was basically as close to being a romantic relationship as possible without actually being one, we spent all our time together).  I remember being sarcastic, judgmental assholes in college together and it was fun, but I always viewed it as a joke and I never actually disliked anyone.  I'd like to think he was the same way, but this has me really worried.  If he rejects me, I honestly would have rather not said anything at all.  We were planning on getting together again soon though and by then I will probably be on hormones.  I don't know if I can hide it.

I want to communicate with real trans people, but don't have a readily available way to do it which is why I'm reaching out to you here today. Feel free to answer as many questions as you would like. 

Here's what I want to know:

2.  Which experiences have empowered you or helped give yourself a positive self image? 

3. What is one thing that you wish that your teachers would have known (or would know) about transgender people?

4. Anything else you want to communicate or tell me about that you think is important! This could be general misconceptions, other experiences, or anything at all! 

If you can, please list how you identify yourself personally so I can have context for your input. This is more for my own knowledge than anything else.

For some context, this hasn't been a lifelong thing. I don't recall wanting to wear dresses and play with dolls as a kid. I was a pretty happy and outgoing kid. It was about the onset of puberty that I became the unconfident, depressed sad sack that I still am today.

I think my issue is with my body image. I'm not I'm bad shape but I hate my body. I have had acne and sweat a lot and feel gross. I don't like facial and body hair but I can't keep it away. I've been apathetic about the way I look for years. I wear baggy clothes and have worn my hair the same way since I was little.

My family and friends tell me they've never seen me being trans as a possibility. I think if it's there I've repressed it deeply. I cannot say for sure if I am trans and I want an answer so I can get on the right path.

I've been seeing a therapist lately and just today began taking steps towards joining an LGBT support group on campus. I just don't want to be wrong and feel stupid about all this. What I've felt could be dysphoria but I'm not sure.

I've taken tests and done thought experiments. I think if I could I would be a girl, but I can't give a good reason why. I can't help but feel like I know so little about myself, like an empty husk that's been going through the motions for years.

So if you've read all of this, I commend you. I guess I just want an answer. I know it has to come from me. But I feel stuck in the middle and I don't like it. Sorry for rambling, but writing this out has been somewhat therapeutic.

Does it sound like I could be trans or am I just depressed and should drop it?"
WhatsWithMyGender,asktransgender,Just came out to a friend for the first time and it went really well.,"Leading up to it, I had never been more nervous in my life. Once I told him, and he was totally cool with it, I felt a wave of relief unlike anything I've ever felt before. It's unbelievable how good I feel right now. The only other people who know either forced me to tell them (parents), or found out by accident (roommate), so telling someone purposefully feels soooooo much better. I just had to share because I feel so fucking good right now."
Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,"I just started hormones, and I am so depressed.","I feel like this is going to take forever, and the thought of that keeps bringing me down. I can't really think of anything else, and I wish I could present as female, but I'm far too bulky and masculine looking to do that.

I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm waiting for something that may never happen. "
Do_You_Hear,asktransgender,I could use some advice,"My child sent me a text today telling me they are transgender. MtF. I (mom)  am the only person in our family that knows.  Several friends do know. 

I told kiddo that I love them more than anything. 

 Kid told me that they had to stop seeing a  gender therapist after he (no disrespect, I just don't know what pronoun to use)  lost his job.  I am paying for that now.  

I've said I love you.  I've said I'll pay for the therapy,  I will support my child through all of this. After we texted and talked,  I treated kid exactly the same as I did before I knew. What else can I do? 

Husband/dad doesn't know yet,  and won't until kid is ready. His family is a bunch of morons. Kid knows that I am on his side,  but how do I help if they aren't? 

What exactly is transgender? I believe it means the body is male,  but the brain (soul? Spirit? IDK) is female.  Is that close? 

I've seen the pronouns xe, hir, cis etc but I don't know what they all mean.  

What should I ask kid? What else do I need to do? I just don't know what comes next, and I want to make sure I don't screw up.

Edit: I am reading all of the info you guys have given me. Thank you all for sharing. I read a few comments, then tear up a bit and go to something else for a while and come back. Not gonna lie, This is hard for me, I can't imagine how hard it is for her and all of you. 

She has told me that her friends use she and her, but that I don't have to use those if i am not comfortable. She has been uncomfortable for a long time and no one gave her a choice. So in private, and here online, I have a daughter. I told her that I would like to go to a therapy appointment in the near future, and she likes that idea. 

She is also the person who pointed me here, so Hi baby! I love you bunches!!

I will continue to read through all of your responses and literature you have so kindly provided me. 

Thank you all so much for your help.  "

aconfusedmoron,asktransgender,"Chest dysphoria, but in which direction?","For the last few days I've been in a bit of a loop. I stuff socks in my shirt, then look in a mirror and like how it looks. Then later I get bothered by the socks slipping down, or being unconvincing in shape/feel. I try to fix it, but it doesn't work, so I toss the socks out. But a few minutes later I want to put them back in my shirt and the cycle starts over.

And the whole time I just feel awful.

I've never been conscious of my chest dysphoria this strongly before. But now I can't shake the fear that I'm giving myself dysphoria by doing the sock thing, and that even though I consciously think I like how it looks I'm actually just cis and I'm giving myself dysphoria in the other direction by padding my chest. I'm not sure if that actually makes sense but I just feel really horrible and invalid."
RefreshToken,asktransgender,Melatonin and estradiol?,"Hi friends,

For years melatonin was my remedy for sleeplessness, but I haven't used any in a while - turns out a gender identity crisis is a great way to forget little chores like buying more melatonin when you run out. My sleep issues are returning, and I'd like to use it again - but Googling around brings up vague rumors that estradiol and melatonin don't play nicely together, and any research papers I find on the topic are well over my head. Does anyone know if taking melatonin a couple times a week will disrupt feminization, or cause some other deleterious side effect? I've already looked into other ways to sleep better and found them lacking - the other pharmaceutical options are quite bad for long term use, and my waking schedule fluctuates too often to have anything like a stable sleeping schedule."

And because people will inevitably ask for this info in responding: I'm at about a year on HRT. I've had ok development so far - I have breasts, if not especially large ones, particularly for my frame. My genetics aren't really great for this, I suspect - my mom was an A cup until she was pregnant with me. My age doesn't help either - I apparently look much younger (yay!), but I'm not 20 or even 30. :|"

If I definitely have the funds to do VFS (on top of the funds to do other transition-related surgeries), should I try speech training first and see how the results go, or just go for the surgery? I'm a bit worried about the speech training, not for pitch so much, but for my tone and cadence, which don't really match typical female *or* male patterns. Am I right in thinking that VFS would create a sufficiently convincing pitch (more so than voice training), such that my atypical speech patterns won't prevent passing, or is that totally deluded? 

Does pitch even matter if I have an unusual cadence to my speech that isn't really feminine *or* masculine?"

mrsindigooo,asktransgender,mtf/24: Does everyone know?,"So I'm living in the Republic of Panama and I am experiencing this weird thing where everyone is using the correct pronouns. LOL! I know this doesn't sound like an issue but I guess I'm just really really confused because when I look in the mirror I still see a huge disgusting monster. I basically want to know if this is something others can relate to or have experienced when going ""full time"" for the first time.

My look is not super femme, I basically wear tight ripped pants w like regular tees. I feel like I'm not even trying sometimes so WHY are they doing this? I like it, of course but it's like I need to know if they're just being nice to me or if they genuinely don't know because that's like so wild and hilarious to me and creates such a big gap between what I see in the mirror and what others see.

I talked to my best friend about this and she said ""I understand that you feel that way when you look in the mirror, but that is not what others see"". Like, okay. I am flat chested and truly doing the bare minimum and I have a huge face. 

It's just so strange because this country is so backwards with LGBT stuff so it feels like I should be facing more harrassment? I'm just so confused! Growing up as a gay teen I was so bullied and now that I'm presenting as female everyone is just being so nice or at least respectful. What's happening?

I guess it could also be that they have so little of a concept of what trans people are that they just assume I'm a girl because they wouldn't even come up with the idea of a ""man"" dressing in womens clothes. 

Or maybe times have changed in South America and people are just nice."

Ughihatemyself123,asktransgender,Does anyone else despite everything..Crave to be cis or in the right body..In a way?,"I've been hating myself forever. I wish that I could just be cis. if there was a button to be cis or the ASAB and body I want i'd press it immediately press it. Being trans has done nothing to benefit my life in any way and the people i've developed relationships with due to this were practically boulders on my mental health and didn't care about one bit about me. They were so mean yet so persuading in their journey for true ""Radicalness and social justice and smashing of the patriarchy"" Despite insulting my existence and using privilege as a pick me up for whenever I asked why. I guess I wish this was all a dream, I wouldn't even care if I woke up a cis girl even... Anything to forget all this pain of looking in the mirror and seeing nothing but a bunch of unwanted body parts.

 Going on an ultra feminization treatment rage to become the ""hottest cis girl alive"" because I keep screwing myself over and thought that my dysphoria was because I was flat chested and a dull girl, Losing all communication with my mom after that morning when I was a child and she told me that she wouldn't love me if I turned out not to be her daughter after discovering trans identities  for the first time. Growing a questionable fetish to the idea of shapeshifting, genderbending at will and rebirth that I attempted smothering myself in my sleep just to see if I would die and get a brand new body. Crying in the shower whenever my period came..Going to tumblr of all places to find refuge due to the painful puberty changes. Being poisoned and gaslighted in the process but was so lonely I didn't really care...

 I just don't want this. I didn't want this at all. In a bittersweet way I miss that old shy cis girl who was full of jokes and actually had a plan for her life to become something and isn't some angry  femboy who riles with visible jealousy from seeing  happy fem cis  guys and would go back if that is absolutely my only option, But if I had a choice i'd just be reborn as a cis guy and work my way up from there. I don't even know why i'm writing this, rebirth doesn't exist and i can't transform into some cis guy, i'm just going to be stuck like a hypocrite because modern level HRT and SRS just makes me feel more angry and disgusting, knowing that the only way I could have a penis is if I barf up 30K$+  or more while cis guys don't really have to do much or anything, it just hurts. I really don't know why i'm writing this, i'm practically screaming into the void already as so many people have made these posts before, I guess i'm just trying to.. er.... stay sane,( If I even have that trait anymore)

So uh, thanks for making it to the end. I wonder if anyone has the same experiences, just waltzing around because we still have no idea where that magic button is located.

arretine7,asktransgender,Transgender or mid-life crisis - am I making this up?,"Hello everyone, I’ve been lurking here for a while but this is the first time I’ve posted anything. I’m 
floundering in doubts and feeling like I’m driving myself crazy so I’m looking for insight and perspective that I don’t seem to be able to achieve on my own. Sorry, this is essentially another ‘Am I trans?’ post and quite long.

In a nutshell, I’m a 49 yo genetic male and within the last year I’ve looked at aspects of my life to date from a new perspective and come to the conclusion that I might be transgender. Now, I know this is something only I can identify and decide, but it’s happened pretty suddenly and I think advice and experience from others will be useful in that process because I am in a state of confusion and maybe denial as I swing from being very nearly convinced and secretly relieved, to thinking I’m imagining things and its all the product of an elaborate mid-life crisis, sometimes on an hourly basis.

I don’t want to go into enormous detail and length over the factors I’ve been thinking about and trying to interpret, but a general outline might be a good idea. One of the key things for me is the fact I crossdressed from a very early age - early enough that one or two memories of this are among my earliest recollections - I’d guess I was 5 or 6. Unlike many, I don’t really remember wishing I was a girl, I didn’t want to play with girls toys and had no female friends. But I did crossdress - a lot. I remember enjoying the feeling of the clothes, but I also studied myself in the mirror when I did it - there seems to have been something symbolic as well as sensual about it that was important, something about the visuals. 

This went on into my teenage years by which time, with the onset of adolescence, it became a very sexualised behaviour and so it remained - until recently I thought that’s what it was: a fetish, a sometimes unhealthy sexual interest in female clothing. I conveniently forgot about the extensive pre-pubescent crossdressing though I did look at girls and wonder/wish about being them. It seems stupid and unbelievable now, but I never linked the early and teen crossdressing in a meaningful way. 

As I got into my later teenage years the crossdressing tailed off. The reasons for this I think were firstly that I had less opportunity as I moved away from home, but also because when I did it, I found myself uncomfortable with the result. Having now researched things a little more, I now think this might be a dysphoric reaction. I never really though I’d suffered with dysphoria but now I wonder. I’ve never been comfortable in my skin or with certain aspects of my body, but I’ve never known why - I’ve not really though about it, other than to curse it - I’ve been especially uneasy about my face and sometimes, looking in the mirror, or at a picture, I have had, and still have a sensation of mild surprise and perhaps disappointment that the image is me. It seems quite probable to me now, that the discomfort I began to feel from crossdressing stemmed from a mismatch between what I felt I should see and what I actually did see. I’d be very interested to hear if anyone else has suffered anything similar - can dysphoria manifest this way?

My general mood and outlook on life are another issue I haven’t ever connected up. I’ve suffered from low mood and outright, though mild, depression fairly continuously since my teens. Mostly it’s been a background thing, but there are times, increasingly in recent years when I’ve felt everything was ultimately pointless. My motivation for most things continues to be affected by it. Anxiety has always been there too, which has affected the way I live in many, everyday, ways. I wonder now if it’s connected with some deeply buried and unrecognised identity dissonance.

I’m now left in a disbelieving state, on the one hand with a whole pile of confusing emotions and possibly half-baked, yet powerful conclusions and on the other thinking how on Earth does this suddenly crop up after 40-odd years? It seems so unbelievable I could have hidden this or not recognised it for 40 odd years and contributes to my own fquestioning of the authenticity of my feelings. 

That last point is one worth asking about as well, as most of those posting here seem (at least to my eyes) to be quite young: there are few oldsters like myself (I could be wrong, but that’s how it seems). Folks my age grew up in the 70s and 80s. Personally, those years were spent in a fairly remote small town in the UK. There was no internet and no mention of trangender issues in the mainstream media which was all that was available. As a consequence, I was totally unable to develop any sort of conceptual framework about the subject, let alone understand it might have relevance to me. Whenthe subject of trangender people did crop up (I can remember just two or three occasions) it was in the context of being freaks or figures of fun. I’d be interested to know others’ experience of this and what peoples’ thoughts are.

I guess I should also mention my own emotional detachment - I’m not very in touch with my feelings and their causes and never have been. I often feel that I’m an observer, like I’m looking at into a room in which my life is happened from outside through the window. I’m unsure whether that’s just me, a symptom of depression or stress or possibly connected with dysphoria in some way. That might have had an influence on how well I’ve been able to join the dots too - as well as my woeful lack of education in the relevant issues and signs!

I’ve written rather more than most probably want to read, but I’d appreciate any input as I’m struggling at the moment, varying between everything being shoved to the back of my head, and being right in my face and unignorable to the point that I’ve had to park my car while driving to cry.

Thanks all"

[deleted],asktransgender,Depressed about my situation?,"I've posted this in another subreddit but I think posting it here would help.

Hi guys, I'm a pre-T college dude and I'm pretty depressed about my situation. I really need to move out of my parents house. They have been stalking me on my social media and basically going into my private information. They even threatened to hack into my computer and see what I'm up to. Unfortunately the college I want to go to is in an expensive area and I have no form of transportation. I feel terrible and I can't take it anymore because my mom is forcing me to do things I don't want to do and I'm so uncomfortable with my voice, body, appearance,etc. I feel like I'm held back from going to new opportunities and moving out will help me pursue my passions much more and be more successful than ever than if I live in my parents house.

I don't have a lot of friends and I tried to ask some of my good friends about people they know and so far I haven't found any people. I tried using the transhousing network thing but that didn't help at all and I had no people contacting me. I don't want to waste my 20s being hidden and not being able to be myself. But I don't want to end up wasting money on an expensive place when I could just split the bill. How do I deal with this dilemma? I don't know if I will ever find any roommates ever. And my dreams of being stealth will be gone too because I plan to go into the media field and people in my area will recognize me if I ever become big or anything like that. 

I have thought about taking a break from college(1 semester) but I want to finish my education as quick as possible and then move out of my area. I'm sick of living here but the schools here are cheaper and take my community college credits. Unless if I transfer again, then the stealth issue and maybe even other minor issues would be resolved. "
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,I might need to look into switching to Whitman-Walker in DC as a backup. Do they prescribe injections? Progesterone?,"**Backstory:** Every now and then I start to worry about my hormone levels.  I've been on HRT for 19 months now, and my Estradiol levels have never, in all that time, reached 100 pg/mL.  The closest I've gotten was 93 pg/mL.  My Endo thinks this is fine, and I have to really tell her that I don't seem to be seeing much feminization, and I'd like it if I could please go up to &gt;=130pg/mL.  She's examined me, and told me that my breasts appear to be Tanner 2.5 or 3, and I don't appear to be developing a very feminine fat distribution (hips not really a thing), yet still is resistant to increasing my dosage to bring me a bit higher into the allowed range, which goes up to 200pg/mL.

I'm on 2.5 Climara Estradiol patches now, i.e. 0.25mg/day, which would probably be roughly equivalent to about 5mg/day of oral Estradiol.  It's rapidly becoming clear that I'm probably not going to be getting up to the midrange levels that I'm hoping for on patches, because I'm running out of space on my body to apply the bloody things.  I could do 3 at a time, but I think that's my limit.  Injections might work better, but my Endo is scared of injections and thinks that trans women who take them may just magically die because Estradiol levels often reach &gt;=1000pg/mL 2 days post-injection.  She also says she doesn't know anything about progesterone and doesn't want to prescribe it.  The last time I asked her to up my dosage, from 2 patches to 2.5 patches, her first suggestion was that instead I might increase my Spiro dosage, which baffled me, as my T levels, at 8ng/dL, are already terrifically squashed; the range is like 0-45, or up to 80, depending upon which source you go by.  Why on earth it would be beneficial to up your Spiro dosage when your T levels are already very low by female standards is beyond me, but that was her recommendation, and I was able to bargain her up to increasing my patch dosage from 2 to 2.5 instead.

So I'm contemplating going out of the Kaiser Permanente network, where all my care is covered, and to another doctor, where only my medication would be covered, because this is my second Kaiser doctor now.  The first one was visibly hostile to me, treating me less like a legitimate patient with an appointment, and more like an unwanted intruder who she was barely able to restrain herself from kicking out of her office.  I was seeing her for 18 months (during which I only saw her in person twice, once pre-HRT and once after 15 months of HRT), and during that time she never once examined me.  This second doctor is much nicer, but still very hesitant to go beyond the lower parts of the Estradiol reference range, much like the first doctor.

So I'm thinking that perhaps I may need to see a doctor who is an absolute master at seeing trans patients.  Someone who sees thousands of trans patients, and knows the ins and outs of treating trans women, rather than a doctor who cautiously sees trans patients every now and then and prefers that they have E2 levels that are within the 70-100pg/mL range because they don't know if mid-range levels of Estradiol are going to make them explode.  Whitman-Walker sounds like a place that would fit that description.  They surely must see thousands of trans women there.

Are my suspicions correct? **Will the doctors at Whitman-Walker, who are doubtless accustomed to seeing tons of trans women, be more comfortable with prescribing Estradiol Valerate injections and Progesterone**, and be unburdened by fears of trans women exploding from E2 levels that are in the mid to upper reference range?

My insurance wouldn't be accepted at Whitman-Walker because it's Kaiser Permanente.  My income is within the range that ordinarily they would give me sliding scale care, but I don't know if they'll still do that given that I have insurance, just not insurance that they accept."
MysticSheik,asktransgender,Why is the gender binary so sacred for many people?,"Hi!
I always see cisgender people getting straight into their defensive positions whenever gender is the topic. Lately in Norway there were articles about the possibility of acknowledging a third gender, and cis people were so against it and there were a lot of hate around it.

I just can't understand why. I mean, if some people get to have a marker in their passport because they are intersex or bigender it won't affect them in a any way, yet they are so against it and hate it. Why are people so against making other people feel good? Why is it that the gender binary is so sacred and that so many people seem to defend it with everything they have?"

mjollnir82,asktransgender,"Not being at ease with my therapist, even if he's very known in the TG help?","Mtf here.
It is one year that I've came back to my birth place and got a gender therapist. 

The story goes like this: I had a gender therapist from the local hospital, but it was only for 8 sessions, and then I had to change therapist. Then I decided to go for a private one. I thus spoke with the director of the clinical department of sexuality and gender identity of the hospital, explaining my situation, and he gave me the name of a therapist, which is very experienced and known.
I then went and see this therapist. And I felt not at ease. I got worried, as I knew that with being not at ease, the therapy could be a pain in the ass. And I spoke with him about this.

Long story short, after ONE YEAR I am still with him. On one side, I thought that it was better to stay with a therapist with which I was not at ease... cause I was never at ease with male mates (I know... I know...), but on the other hand I felt very uneasy, and I still do. In the meanwhile some things are solved, but... I still feel not at ease, and feel that this is taking too much energy from my side.
In the very last days, however, I started to feel more at ease. But... I feel that he doesn't believe that I am a girl (but maybe I don't believe it myself either...).

Have you ever experienced something like this? 
Jeez, I hate all this! I feel a crap! My God... I always make a mess out of things.


**Update**: *I am actively searching for a new therapist (a female one, specifically), while I am discussing with my actual therapist the things that I am feeling with him, my doubts and the steps I am taking.
Thanks for your help!*"
Jul2Dec,asktransgender,Three little questions about GRS and HRT,"Hi!
So I'm gonna do this super quick. I have three questions and I'd appreciate if you guys/gals can answer them:

1. Is it possible to get a GRS that removes the balls, but keeps the penis? I read some things on twitter about this and this was so interesting to me. I always thought you had to go all the way, but it seems like you don't? If you'd keep the penis would you still be able to get erections and use it like normal, just without ya know... White stuff coming out? Somehow this feels a little embarassing to ask... &gt;_&gt;

2. When going on HRT is muscle loss really that big? Because I don't think it's biologically possible to have less muscle than I have. Except maybe in the legs because for whatever reason (maybe cause I cycle a lot?) I've always had strong legs and I kinda like em.

3. When your boobs grow, do they feel like cis-girls boobs in the sense that you can get aroused?

Thank you and have a nice day :)"

will this invalidate my identifying as male in the community as a whole because although i feel like a man, I still want to portray myself as a woman (although highly exaggerated(?)). Would I be seen as a trap because of my outward feminine appearance?  I've been thinking the more I'm comfortable, i'd like to start dragging full time, maybe join a house if they still exist.

sparkle-farts,asktransgender,Where'd my orgasm go? [NSFW],"So for the the first few months of hormones, I was having very satisfying orgasm.  I don't know how hormones effected that because it had been a while since having sex, and then I started having really really great sex (anal and penile stimulation) which were accompanied by mind blowing orgasms.  tbh i think the hormones had nothing to do with it, i just think my partner was fantastic.  

But now, when i'm masturbating, it feels really good and then when i feel like im about to climax, the feeling stops.  my penis feels like it would normally feel right after orgasming and I don't have any of the feelings that go along with an orgasm though.  I do not ejaculate any more which is fine, but is the ability to have an orgasm dependent on that?

Side note: my penis hurts when i'm fully erect now.  Not sure if thats relevant.  

I should note that I haven't had sex in about 6 months now.  But when i would have orgasms administered by other people, it was very satisfying. In the past 6 months, I think I've had 1 or 2 satisfying orgasms while simultaneously stimulating my penis and prostate. But I also have hemorrhoids now and any kinda of anal stimulation is not quite an option.  

Other facts about me:
-21
-trans woman
-4mg estrodial/day in the form of a pill
-200 mg spiro/day


tl;dr:  After a year of hormones, i dont have orgasms.  When masturbating it feels pleasurable and then just stops without really feeling like a climax."

millennium_fae,asktransgender,"ARGHH my poor, sore legs ... does anybody on T sympathize?","I've been on T for 15 months, and since the sixth month mark, I've had persistent soreness in my legs when walking for a certain amount of time.

I've mentioned the soreness to my doctor just as a side note while listing recent changes, and nothing was made of it so I assume it's normal.

The soreness just feels like a minor muscle strain that stretches from the front of my calves and up to my thighs if I'm climbing several flights of stairs. If I'm walking for more than 15 minutes - or at a faster pace - the soreness will start up and does accumulate. Once I give it a rest for a few minutes, the soreness is gone. 

My best guess is that my muscles are changing and growing, and things are awkward and unbalanced. Anybody empathize, and how do you deal?"
ella1297,asktransgender,Help with confusing situation?,"Hi,

I'm a 19 year old high school senior. So a year and a half ago i admitted to myself that i am gay, and went through depression because i wasn't ok with it. long story short, my parents found out i was gay, withdrew me from the school i had gone to, and kicked me out. originally, i was going to be kicked out on the street (i lived in d.c.). however, the ""compromise"" i came to with my parents is that i would ""fix"" myself in exchange for being kicked out and sent to other family members in new hampshire to live. 

however, in january, i admitted to myself that i am a girl. i've spent a few weeks adjusting and accepting this part of me, but my dysphoria is really bad and crippling and i have to transition because i don't think i'll be able to wait any longer. however, my problem is this: my family, even the ones i moved to over the summer, are not at all accepting and there is absolutely no chance i will be able to transition without them knowing and kicking me out. so what i'm thinking of doing is leaving my family and living on my own, but i don't know what to do or how i'm even going to survive all alone, much less be able to transition and be myself. for over a year and a half i have suffered severe depression and it's only getting worse, and i'm scared and i don't want to feel like this because the pain i suffer is too much for me to handle and i'm lost."

Perniciosasque,asktransgender,Need some encouragement or maybe some friends?,"I think I could use a little encouragement right now. My transition (to begin HRT, basically) suddenly seems very distant and I wouldn't mind some uplifting words or advice on how to cope with it.

In my country we have certain gender clinics you go to. I had to wait 14 months to begin my ""investigation"", so to speak and I had my first appointment back in June last year. I've had my blood checked and I've met with the speech therapist where I recorded my pre-T voice. It seemed like I was close to getting my diagnosis which is a requirement to get HRT.

I checked my online medical journal about two weeks ago and it said ""Main diagnosis: transsexualism"" which is odd because nobody has told me anything. So I made the decision to give them a call today and I kind of regret it now. The kind lady on the phone told me that 1) I do not have the diagnosis yet and 2) I won't be able to get my next appointment until after the summer. Maybe.

**Boom.** The sheer size of the lump in my throat at that very moment... I can't even describe it. Here I was, thinking I'm close to being done with this BS, getting shot down in an instant. I'm so sick and tired of this.

The lady then went on to tell me that I could give another gender clinic a call and see if their waiting list to the psychologist is shorter. I will. Definitely. I can't see myself coping with having to wait even more. At least right now I can't, even though I've already been waiting and waiting. I know it generally does take longer than 6 months but if you add the 14 months to that and now an extra 6 months it becomes very overwhelming. I used to have a friend who went to a different gender clinic and they only had to wait 5 months for their first appointment and they was done in under 6 months. I know you're not supposed to compare but both of us shared a lot and the only reason my process is so drawn out is because of the gender clinic.

I'm 150% sure that transitioning is the only way for me to ever be able to live somewhat happily. I only wish I'd come across the word 'transgender' sooner.

Thanks for reading. If you don't want to specifically talk about anything trans related, I'm up for it. I think I just need some distraction right now. Thanks!

Feelabitlostwithher,asktransgender,"Sooooo, i love a girl.....","Not sure if its the right place to ask this stuff but i kinda want to get this sortof off my chest and this may be the best place for it.

So a few years ago i met a girl online, we started being very cutesy with one another and eventually we started a relationship. It only lasted a year or so and it was online but she had sent me some pictures of how she looked but was always concerned about her voice so never spoke on mic. Eventually it ended because i was going into depression about my course and was drifting away from everyone.

Eventually when i started feeling better about a year and a half ago i got back in contact and after a few months we started stuff up again, at this point she was more confident with her voice so i could properly talk to her, and she was generally a bit more confident about herself so was more open and outgoing then she was.


Now, heres where it starts getting into the territory of why im here.


So she came out to me that she was trans. it only came out after she was having considerable worries about a couple of surgeries she had kept quiet about. She explained that she was post-op and there was an mistake during her surgery that caused other issues and she just wanted to talk to me honesltly about it and have me accept her. Of course i was perfectly happy with it, i know its hard to explain it to someone youre attracted to and i have nothing but goodwill towards anyone who has gender dysphoria. So i told her i still loved her and we moved on, me giving her as much support as i could and letting her know nothing had changed.


This brings us up to a week ago, when she was in more of a panic about her surgeries and revealed that it wasnt to fix the mistake, but to actually have it in the first place, she was not post-op. Again i told her it was fine and i still loved her and nothing had changed.


My worry is not the love for her or the way i treat her, its just i now feel like he could be lying about other things consideing she lied about so much already. I just want to know if theres anything i can do to make her feel safe and trust me. I do want whats best for her, but i feel i cant if she keeps stuff like this secret.


I think thats enough of an info dump, just wanted to get this off my chest. For reference i had inklings of her being transgendered and pre-op before she told me either and decided not to inform her of my suspicions in fear she would get angry at me for making such assumptions if they were false"
August1453,asktransgender,"I don't know which would be more difficult to handle: actually being trans, or this being just a midlife crisis","I'm 41.  AMAB, physically very masculine, not bad looking as men go.  But I could never transition, even if I *were* trans.  Too much to lose.  And above all, I'm just too old.   :(


My bigger fear right now though, ironically, is that I'm NOT trans: that this is just a crisis, a phase.  I really don't wanna be the pathetic middle aged guy wearing nail polish and women's skinny jeans who'll outgrow it in a few years and be embarrassed by having gone through it.  (NOT because transgender behavior is shameful, but because midlife crises carry a social stigma around them.)


So either way, I'm just heartbroken.  Either I'm trans, and will forever live with dysphoria, or I'm NOT trans, and any little thing I do right now to relieve dysphoria will just make me cringe when looking back on it years from now (again, because midlife crises are ""pathetic"", not transgender behavior)."

When I was interviewed, I knew about the equal opportunity system and awkwardly said..""hey, well..I'm transgender."" I was greeted with relief of ""hey, that's totally okay! You don't have to tell anyone if you don't want to it's your own personal business, and we're just glad to have you on board"". I was so happy!!

..Anyhow like..the guy who hired me EXPRESSIDLY said ""you don't have to tell anyone if you don't want to"" AND ""nobody has to know if you don't want them to"". But he keeps on calling me ""she her miss ma'm"" when I even stepped aside to ask him ""hey can you call me by male pronouns and all because that's what I asked for when you hired me"" but he keeps doing it? Even when my nametag says my boy name on it? And this is the worst part that is the meat of my argument and what I am getting at; all my new coworkers KNOW. People I had met for the VERY first time, coworkers I had never seen before suddenly knew I was trans literally overnight, saying things like, ""Hey ma'm! OH I am SO sorry I know I know you want to go by HE right?? I'm so stupid I'm sorry honey!"" But.. I just met you?? How do you know??? So after meeting my supervisor and seeing the man who hired me/my manager pull the supervisor aside after she called me ""ma'm/she (meeting me for the first time) he pulled her over and said ""hey we talked about this"".

I just wanted to start as ""the new guy :)"" but now I'm ""your new TRANSGENDER """"""guy"""""""" coworker!!!"" And people keep overdoing it with ""hey brother! Hey man! What's up dude!!"" Everytime they see/talk to me like they feel like i'all get really offended if they don't overmasculinate me at every conversation. 
I just
The fact that people I had never met knew about my trans status from the VERY MAN who said it was my business and then the gossip spread through the workplace in literal hours after I started working I'm just,, so upset I've been crying. I feel like my confidentiality and my trust in my coworkers has been broken and that I have been really disrespected by people who I wanted to get a fresh start with. And I feel like..I can't mention it or say anything because I feel like if I talk about it that ""being trans is all I am"" which I already feel through their burning stares while I'm at work.

2. I've heard that mental changes from taking hormones happen very quickly, with in the first month if not in the first week. And also that you can very easily tell whether they're right for you, as they will have amazing psychological effects on transgender people but be very damaging for cis people.

Hello, I'm aware that there are already a lot of posts regarding this issue, but I'm still not sure about the answer.
Just to give a little context, recently i've come to the conclusion that I'm almost sure i am a transgender girl, so in the case that i eventually create the courage to tell this to my mom and start HRT, i want to know more about your experiences with hair regrowth.
So, I'm not really suffering hair loss, but i do have widow's peak(i guess that's what it's called), I believe all the males on my family have it, but none of them is bald, so I don't actually worry about losing more hair.
I am really hoping that it could regrow, because my hair has always been one of the few parts of my body that i like, but now i feel like the shape of my hair is too masculine because of that, I took 3 pictures if anyone is willing to see it, here's the link http://imgur.com/a/UHWRi , any chance for my hair to fill in those parts? Also, what other changes should i expect?
I'm sorry if this post is too long, I'm really not sure of what i should write and I'm still very afraid of my future, thank you if you took your time to read it! :)"

I'll be honest, I didn't like it. Nothing really to do with the makeup job itself apart from probably needing a darker foundation, it's just...

...well, I felt like the way I looked. A man wearing makeup.

I tried to find some angles in which I looked prettier, more feminine, but it didn't work (I never realised how goddam MASCULINE my chin looked until this.) If anything, I feel more male than I have in a long time - by my reckoning, if I was actually trans, even looking slightly more feminine should have felt good. Instead, everything just felt off. I only really liked my appearance from a looong distance.

What do you folks think?

BeltedDress,asktransgender,Thanks for the compliment... Kind of?,"I keep getting complements from people who clearly are clocking me first.

First example (I'm MTF by the way): I went to a living room concert for one of my favorite musicians. I'm in line to get some merch when suddenly, the musician's mom comes out of nowhere and says that she wanted to say that I'm brave and beautiful and hopes that someone tells me that every day. (Suuuuuper surreal btw)

Second example: I hop in to a taxi. Without saying a word, he looks at me: excuse me, but is it sir or madam? ... I'm a woman. You're such a beautiful lady! Where would you like to go?

Like... People's heart are in the right place, but I always feel a little worse, so I never know how to respond. How do you respond in these situations?"
Eleanor_Rach,asktransgender,"Feel More Trans When Hungover, Why?","So I've been questioning my gender for a long time on and off since I was probably 11/12, I'm 20 now.

I will go through patches of not wanting to transition and then periods of really bad dysphoria. But I'm still apprehensive about transitioning and scared I will end up filled with regret.

Anyway, one thing I find really weird is that nearly always when I'm hungover I will feel an extreme urge to transition. I have nearly made doctors appointments several times when hungover to discuss transitioning.


I dont know why I'm like this, it's hard enough being hungover without intensely questioning my gender. But then the next day the urge and malaise is gone and I feel quite happy being male.

I know it seems quite trivial but has anyone else had experiences like this? What do you think it means?"

shelbon22,asktransgender,Questions about orchi,"I tried posting this on /r/mtf but didn't get much response. So I'm pretty dead set on getting an orchiectomy but I have some questions for those who have done so already.

If you still were able to have erections pre-orchi, did the surgery change that?

Does it help HRT to be more effective? Or did it just make so an AA was no longer necessary?

Aside from erections, did it have any impact on sex what so ever?

I don't plan having SRS but I've read that they use the scrotum in the procedure, I think to make part of the labia. In the chance that I change my mind about SRS, would that cause complications?

_Unoriginal_Name_,asktransgender,Any advice on how to improve my coming out plan/coming out letter to a friend?,"(This is my first time posting on this subreddit and on reddit at all, so I apologise if I've formatted something incorrectly or broken any kind of rules.)

I'm 15 years old MTF, I'm too terrified to come out to my parents due to anxiety, even though I know their views on LGBTQ+ are positive. So I'm planning to come out to a trusted, long-time friend by leaving this letter where they'll find it, but it'll be found after I've left school so that they have the weekend to think it over.

This is my first draft:

&gt;Dear [REDACTED],

&gt;There's one thing I'd like you to keep in mind while reading this; I have agonised over this for more time than I can remember, I have been far too scared to tell anybody for far too long and I'm honestly surprised I convinced myself to write this. I suppose I'll stop delaying it and get to the point.

&gt;I know that you had someone close to you come out to you before and you didn't seem to react negatively (Yes, this impacted my decision to tell you.), however I don't know how much they elaborated on how they felt so I'm going to say this in the simplest possible terms: Even though my body is male, my brain and gender identity are female. This difference between my body and my brain causes lots of emotional stress and anxiety. If you hadn't guessed, I'm transgender.

&gt;I would appreciate if this was kept between us, telling other people (Even people you might consider close to me) would be a  breach of my trust, I would like to tell people on my own terms. 

&gt;You may be wondering how many people know this about me, the answer to that would be **one**, it's you. I know we have been going through a bit of a rough patch with our friendship lately, so I hope me telling you all of this  before even my family is a sign of how indebted I am to you, for everything.

&gt;For now, I won't ask you to call me by preferred pronouns or by a new name, I'm not ready for that yet. I wouldn't feel comfortable being treated female whilst physically I am completely male. I haven't fully decided on any names yet but I have some ideas, your opinions would be appreciated.

&gt;I just want you to remember, I'll still the same person with the same interests, however my physical appearance will change throughout my transition. I'm not saying there won't be change, but it will be for the better. 

&gt;You are free to ask whatever questions you may have, I will try to answer most of them, though please avoid anything inappropriate. Also, I'd prefer if we spoke about this at a time when there is no 'Third-party' to eavesdrop.

&gt;If you send me a text or call me, I may not respond instantly or at all, this is purely because coming out is a terrifying thing to do, I'm sure you can guess why. But that doesn't mean I'm holding anything against you, I'm not.

&gt;I don't open up to people often, so I hope I can count on your support.

&gt;Thank you for your time, [REDACTED].


Any advice is appreciated.

DialgaTheTimeLord,asktransgender,How to come out to and perhaps educate an ignorant parent?,"Hoo boy. So I'm starting to actually get the ball rolling a bit here, and I'm more than a bit nervous. I've set up a meeting with someone on campus to talk a bit about this whole deal. At some point though, the time will come when I come out to my mother. My step-mom Phyllis and my dad are a bit easier to talk to about these things... but I don't live  with them. In fact, I rarely get time to  see them these days because of college. 

Now, my mom is... tolerant, I guess? I don't think I can call it 'accepting' exactly, though I think she'd still support me. She thinks it's funny how many kids are gay/bi these days. The idea of being trans is even more confusing and funny to her, and heaven forbid they're *both*. I told her that my friend Gabe's brother is trans and gay, and I'm pretty sure she said something like: ""So she think's she's a guy and she's into guys."" Yes, that was more of a statement than an actual question. Then cue a chuckle. It does NOT help that *literally on Christmas day* she confronted me and asked if I was gay. Technically, I am, but not the way she thinks, being FTM lesbian and all. So yeah, I'm pretty sure you can see my frustration and anxiety about this.

TL;DR help me explain being trans to my mom when I'm ready to come out."

mjollnir82,asktransgender,"I was wondering why I always felt (and feel) that I can't bear being homosexual, but I am totally cool with the idea of being transgender AND bisexual","I am born male, and always feared the idea of being gay and effeminate. But now I discovered that I am TG MTF, I am ok with being effeminate or masculine, as well as of being straight (I.e., attracted to male individuals) or homosexual. Like, I feel I can bear things better than before.
Also... I fear being a male gay (and I feel a strong malaise when thinking that), but I don't fear being TG (and I feel wonderfully well)...

Anyone out there experienced this? 

May this depend on the fact that being misgendered/mis-identified (like someone saying ""you are not what you think you are) mines the confidence about what you feel, making you insecure and needy? 
Or am I living a kind of dissociation? "
loveasaconstruct,asktransgender,I'm in a weird situation with my parents and have no idea how to get out of it. Advice?,"So I suppose a little bit of backstory is in order.  

I'm 18 right now. I've identified as transgender (MTF) for somewhere in the neighborhood of 6+ years -- it's kind of hard to put a date on when I first started identifying like this, because it was a weird process.  

I came out to my parents when I was 13 or so. I wasn't berated or yelled at; my parents were just super confused and didn't know what to do with the knowledge. We didn't discuss it for a good while after that. Fast forward to a couple years later -- my mom, a high school art teacher, had a trans student for the first time and it seemed to open her eyes. We talked a little more and still nothing came out of it.  

Fast forward AGAIN to about a year and a half ago, and I managed to work up the nerve to remind my mom about this whole thing, since I believed that it had gone from her thoughts. We had a couple little discussions about it and then fell silent again.  

Finally, we reach this past year. A couple months ago, my parents sat me down at the dinner table, and my mom soon began crying and pleading with me to accept myself. She said that she saw how much I was hurting (a completely correct analysis), and that she and my dad want nothing more than to support me and help me move things further. Hell, just the other day, she was talking to me about ""my transition,"" something I've never heard her discuss, and she's been talking to me more and more about things relating to my gender and my identity. I seldom find the courage to say one word in direct response.

*The problem comes in here.* Being 18 and able to consent and all, I finally have a real opportunity to get hormones. I would be getting them through my provider of choice, Planned Parenthood -- I could basically drive out tomorrow and start getting screened and evaluated, because my local PP offers trans services, including HRT. The issue is that for some reason, I can't bring myself to talk about my gender with my parents. Every time I feel driven to, even if it feels like a matter of life and death for me, I back down almost immediately. It feels terrible. I have something a ton of trans kids wish they had -- accepting parents -- and yet I can't even make myself talk things through with them.  

This is consuming me now. I'm reaching a peak point of dysphoria. I feel less and less like myself every single day, and it feels like I'm being eaten alive by the sheer self hatred and discomfort I'm experiencing. The question is, what the hell should I do about this? I've always been painfully awkward when it comes to talking to my parents about important things, especially emotion- and mental-health-related things, and I'm completely stuck right now.  

How should I start this conversation back up? How do I get past this horrible, awkward, anxiety-borne barrier that's keeping me from being happy and living as my most authentic self?"
MurakamiDelRey,asktransgender,If I knew who I was I'd have an easier time fucking hating myself.,"I've been angry all evening and it took me a while to work out why. I'm never me. I seem to change who I am for different people. For some people I'm this cunt who loves to blaze up and get drunk. For some I'm a feminine queer guy. And it goes on like this, for 4 or 5 different people or groups. I'm at the point where I don't fucking know who I am. My mood and personality is never the same. I was furious at the start of writing this post and now I'm almost fucking crying.

Has anyone else dealt with this bullshit? Is it because I'm trans? Am I making this shit up because maybe it will distract me from who I really am? Even with the people I'm out as trans to I'm not me. I still pretend to be someone else. 

I'm so over this and over everything. I want to run away but even then I'd still have myself to deal with. "
tgpineapple,asktransgender,I had an awkward passing moment today!,"I had to get my blood drawn today and I'm used to it but waking up super early to get it done has got to be the worst. I got to the centre and everyone was super nice to me and I was like ""what this never happened before."" I sat in the lobby and waited awhile and this russian technician called me up. 

She called someone up before me and she looked really strict and like super terse to him and it make me kind of anxious. Anyway, when I went with her into the room, she was like super nice to me, making small talk and trying to make it as comfortable as possible while she confirmed my details. After that's done she drew my blood and she was like ""don't look at me, don't look down."" I guess so I wouldn't freak out or something. _This wasn't my first rodeo :P_ She was assuring but I kind of laughed it off to myself. 

At the end she was finishing off the writeup and she suddenly turns to me and asks ""are you on hormone replacement?"" when she was looking over test details. And I was like _oh no is this bad_. I said yes and she asked what I was on and I gave her details. She asks me to check the labels to make sure they're correct and asks me if I'm sure - to which I say yes. 

She then hands me the form and points to the M under sex and furrows her brow and says ""is this correct?"" And I looked at her and nodded yes. Then she asked me again, ""are you sure?"" And I said yes again. Then she said ""I just need to make sure because you look like a lady to me, not a man.""

:O That made me so happy. I've never had a moment where this kind of happened. I guess she said it to make me feel better because she knew what hormone replacement meant (for me), but I like to think I passed. Regardless, it was such a nice thing to say and I feel totally accepted and awesome. I'm already on a high because yesterday I went out in guy-mode with some people I knew and some people I didn't and everyone who I didn't know just assumed I was cis and didn't question it. I had to avoid answering questions that would out me as trans :T

Peter__D,asktransgender,How much does facial structure change with HRT alone?,"Right now I'm living as male/androgynous because I'm staying with my conservative Christian family until I finish college in a year. For reference, [here](http://imgur.com/a/0QQoU) are some picture of myself.

I'm really curious though about how HRT would change my face. I'm definitely a tomboy, and wouldn't wear much makeup past mascara and eye shadow, so I don't want to rely on contouring my whole life.

MonicaRising,asktransgender,3 month HRT blood level test results,"I don't go to see my Endo for 2 more days but I got the test results this morning. From everything I'm reading on the internet I should be pretty thrilled with the results. And I think I am kind of excited but I can't be sure. Here are what my results are as of exactly 14 weeks:
T = 27 ng/mL and E = 213 pg/mL
So... that's totally in the target range, right? 
These levels, at only 3 months, seem like levels that some trans women struggle to reach for years - so I feel like I should be feeling very fortunate, no? Does it even matter at all that I took my morning dose maybe an hour or three before the blood test? I only take half of both in the morning and then half of both at night. All comments based on experience are very welcome!
Oh - I am 4mg estradiol sublingual and 100mg spiro orally, per day

throwawayaaaaaaaawhy,asktransgender,Is it safe to deliberately atrophy your penis?,MtF with terrible genital dysphoria. I'm poor and probably never going to be able to afford SRS.

OkSoHereItIs,asktransgender,"Really Overwhelmed, Could Use Some Advice.","So I am 18, Male, and definitely in an unfamiliar situation. 
About 4 months ago I came out as Bi to my girlfriend who is fully supportive and we're still together, and about two weeks ago I came out to my immediate family, who are basically understanding, if a bit hesitant and slightly connotative at first. 

Now I have throughout my life always been very attracted to the female form, so much so as to occasionally wear female clothes in a mirror, and sometimes wish i could experience being female. I always assumed I just had a very perverted mind, but recently I've begun to think that it may be something more. There is definitely a sexual attraction component to it, but it also seems like when I'm alone I want be more effeminate , and when I do it makes me happy, and feel more comfortable with myself. 
Obviously this all seems to point in the direction of me being trans, but I'm just not sure what to think at this point. 

So what do you all who have more experience think I should do? If I do come out to anyone, it will be to my girlfriend first, and I would want to fully commit and start HRT as soon as possible if this is indeed the path I find is best, which would obviously need to involve my parents, and likely it sounds therapy, which isn't something I've undergone before. Sorry this has been pretty rambly, but I'm just looking for some opinions on what I should do, having no idea myself. Thanks :D"

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Doctors ruin it every time...,"I am 16, live in Germany and should have gotten estrogen today... Well, the date was originally December 2016. Everytime I did go to the therapists to get the confirmation, I got rejected, destroying my hope everytime as they tell me that I will get the stuff to get the recipe for the estrogen at the following appointment.

Now last time I was visiting the therapist, she said she will call the endocrinologist and will tell him that everything is ok and we can finally begin. Today I was really hyped to get estrogen after all the time, I was there and my endocrinologist told me that my therapist discussed to not give them to me, again... I started crying and don't know what to do anymore. I just feel like trash not only because they are not giving it to me but because that they crush my hope to dust everytime.

I got a new appointment with my therapist in 2 weeks, she said she will then finally give me the stuff, I obviously can't trust her at all. Another problem is that I am missing in school as it takes 2-3 hours to drive to my therapist all the time. She is not just ruining my transition, happiness and hopes but my education, too. What to do? I actually have really bad chances to do anything as I am underage and they can treat me like shit all the time without someone to stop them."

So at this point I'm trying to sort out a therapist to explore this gender thing, along with my general anxiety and random bouts with depression, and the fact that I have hardly any confidence outside of work.

The problem is there are a million 'therapists' but I get the feeling a lot of them are like chiropractors, so it feels like a bit of a minefield, and I don't want to waste money.

So what do I need to be looking for?  I'm not interested in someone who's just going to fast track me into hormones, I'm not really at that stage yet (honestly the doubt from questioning gender embarrasses me a little and it's really hard to talk about out loud).  Should I be looking for psychologists, or LISW, or something else?

If it helps, I'm based out of central OH if anyone has specific recommendations.

pastelbloodbath,asktransgender,"On and Off Dysphoria, but not knowing what I want. What should I do?","hi, i'm currently living and presenting myself as a woman to everyone. doing makeup, having longer hair (not by choice), having feminine tendencies, etc. I expressed myself as more masculine in my early years and mid teens (wanting to identify as a male and wanting to go by Matthew) but eventually started going back to more feminine things out of expectation (i guess). i have the constant strong urge to chop off all my hair, but just settle for cutting down to a part way down my shoulders so that i don't ""freak"" anyone out. I can't afford to have it cut, as I live with my parents and don't have a job, as I have severe social anxiety. 

in my later teens i tried to express myself as ""genderfluid"", but gave up on that as i didn't feel comfortable as that either. i then stayed in some sort of apathetic medium until recently, as I've started to want facial hair and masculine features again. I've only recently realized i depersonalize my body a lot of the time, and not taking care of myself as much as i should. i'm 20 and generally starting to become more and more uncomfortable with my voice and facial structure and hair to the point of not wanting to talk, and I haven't left my house since june of last year, except for appointments. 

The problem with all of this is that I don't know what I want to be or present as. I don't feel enough of a man to have a penis or be the stereotypical male, but when i see my face with makeup or dresses or anything feminine, it's incredibly hard to identify with it, to the point where sometimes i don't want to believe that it's me. i feel like i'm in some sort of medium where i can't/don't want to express who i feel like i am inside, but it's tearing me up inside to continue on like this, and I don't think i can continue on like this for another 5-10 years. I mainly don't want to burden anyone right now. I feel like it'd be easier just to stay a woman than to put everyone else off/make someone else go out of their way for me. I don't know what to do, and it's almost literally killing me. Any advice would be appreciated. "

They originally wanted me full-time to even get hormones, and the rules have changed a couple times since then, but I finally thought they were happy with me starting full-time this summer. I live in a really red state with almost no trans services, so I can't really go somewhere else if they drop me. I'm kind of at their mercy and it's really started wearing me down.

I'm not sure what to do. The idea of losing HRT scares the hell out of me, but I don't feel at all ready to make this jump. The experience so far has been really stressful and full of pressure, and I've never really been happy with how I've been treated. Driving a state over to the closest IC clinic seems crazy but I feel like I don't have any options if they decide to drop me as a patient.

zauraz,asktransgender,[NSFW] [Rant] I am making myself sick..,"I masturbate, a lot. Especially to ""non-sex"" porn but fanart and clothing. I have kept trying for so long to get away from it but I always return in the end so I have more gone towards accepting myself for doing it which helped more than combat it in all honesty.

However here is the problem.. I am a girl with a dick atm.. I am a girl that ejaculates from male genitalia and lately that makes me more and more sick of myself.. How can I be a girl and jack off with male genitalia?! I never thought of it like this before but I always had a feeling of disgust or illness after masturbating before but now its worse because I know that I am probably doing the most ""unfemale"" thing there is... I am abusing the body of my biological sex for pleasure.. a body I hate... Yet however I can't stop as it feels good..

Right now I wish I could have SRS to remove the potential for masturbating altogether. I wish that I could stop it all. Yet I do keep wondering how I will feel once that ""THING"" is gone.. I am disgusting... yet I am still disgusted by female genitalia sorta aswell but atleast it would be flat down there.... I don't want this shitty worm between my legs for anything else than the sexual pleasure it gives me but yet some part of me wishes to keep that.. However it is also the one permanent and constant reminder of my biological sex.. its the one thing that I feel is truly holding me back from being a girl.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore or cope. I don't even know what it is really, self hatred, depression? Maybe the dysphoria I won't accept? I am still just a ""boy"" with hormones jacking off to porn which is so far off from being the girl I want to be... I am impure in so many ways.....

[deleted],asktransgender,Having one of those impossible to move depression days. cw: self-harm,"I managed to leave the house to go to the bank (but only because I need money to pay my psychiatrist) and when I got home I crashed and I just can't move. 

I should be feeling great. I got gendered female twice today (once on the phone, once irl in dude-clothes) but I'm just incredibly depressed. It could be that a good friend's having issues with her girlfriend and that I love the hell out of both of them (like family) and seeing them upset has crushed me or it could just be general mental health bullshit.

But it just keeps being like this. I'm medicated (antidepressants and ridiculously high dose mood stabilisers) but I'm still feeling like crap.  I had my 1 blocker anniversary two days ago; I hung out with some amazing friends and had a great time, but by the time I got home I was so depressed I had to self-harm just to make it through the night.

Idk, I should really be happy now. I've changed my gender legally everywhere I can. I've changed my name; I have some great friends who are more like family to me than most of my family. I'm going to get to study translation (my favourite field in the world) at my new university this year. I even sometimes get gendered right. I just think that my brain chemistry is hosed and I can't enjoy anything?

Idk, anyone else feel like even though everything's going great in their lives that they can't be happy?"
th3saurus,asktransgender,Hits and Misses with updating my new name and gender marker,"I was a busy bee today, I went to court to tear down the notice of ruling, and they gave me my certified court order.

I went to the DMV, then my credit union, and finally made a long voyage to the town over for my social security.

The DMV went smoothly, except for the photo of course, but hey those are always bad. I didn't have to fill out any additional forms, just the normal one, and I renewed my permit at the same time (aargh, maybe this time I will learn to drive).

Afterwards I went to the bank to get new checks and cards. I ran into a little snag, since the credit report was under my new name, I appeared to have no credit history. I was still able to get everything I needed, but I will have to be really careful to pay my card off completely each month until the system has figured out that I have the same credit history as my old name.

Finally I made a long trip through the rain to visit the social security office, only to figure out that a learner's permit is not an acceptable form of ID for them. It was a bit of a shock, and after the arduous journey it took everything I had not to burst out in tears right there.

Still altogether, I'd say today was pretty successful.

Mikaela_,asktransgender,Coming out problems,"Hi! 

I'm 18, MtF.


I want to come out to my mom, so I can get a therapist and hopefully start fixing my life a little bit.


There are a few problems with this.

1. I know my mom would be okay with me being gay, or bi, or whatever. BUT I have NO idea how she would react to me being transgender. The only reason I'm not homeless or living in a shitty apartment on welfare is her support, i don't have a job or the capacity to get one realistically. If she were to react badly and discontinue that support, I would be screwed.


2. Language barrier. I speak English and a little bit of French (enough for small talk) and she speaks French and only a tiny bit of English (barely enough to say hello) this would be a problem, I have no idea how to write in French so I have to do it in person which leads me to 


3. I'm a big coward, telling friends I didn't even really know that well online had me shaking unable to move for minutes from the stress, I can't imagine how I'll take this one.



Also are there any gender therapists in Quebec who speak English?"

Reon98,asktransgender,A Little Rant. Hoping Some People Can Relate? (What If?),"My dysphoria is a pain in the ass.

I don't remember having any noticeable or painful dysphoria before I started questioning. I don't know why that is, and to a point that makes me feel invalid as a part of this community. It's not that it wasn't there, I can cite examples of things that could have been manifestations of dysphoria, but even so.

To make it worse, it's now just really weird. Most of what I hear about dysphoria is people talking about how it's just painful to live in their bodies; an overwhelming wish to have been born differently. And okay. Yes. I have that. But also, my dysphoria is more often than not, a little voice in the back of my head- a deep bass- that just constantly leans over my shoulder and says ""you're not really trans."" 

And like. It scares me. I'm afraid of being wrong. What if I've just made this up? What if I'm totally off and I'm just a hypochondriac or I'm letting others influence me? What if this isn't dysphoria at all and it's just my conscience telling me what's right and wrong?

And then, I kind of get back to ""normal"". The voice goes away and the fear of my future sets in. What if my parents find out? What if I never am who I want to be? What if I'm killed. What if? What if? What if?

It all feels so stupid and futile and I don't understand why I feel this way. Why didn't I feel this before? Why didn't I just know like my other trans friends? Why wasn't I born a girl like my sister? 

I know it's idiotic and dumb to ask. The answer is simple and it all boils down to luck or god or the universe or something. But I'm just so.... Confused? But also certain. I'm scared, but excited? I don't know.

It's like I want to cry, but the tears won't come.

TL;DR: I'm ranting and asking the same questions everyone probably asks all the time on this subreddit."

stardustarchives,asktransgender,Exhaustion-based nervous breakdown - I'm getting treatment now,"Hi everyone, 

I've known that I'm trans for about a year now, and while my partner has completely accepted me, and I'm out at work, I'm still completely pre everything. My mom knows, and while she just wants me to be happy, you can tell that she still really has no idea how to process the information. 

Various factors have prevented me from starting my transition, as well as getting treatment for my other mental illnesses, which include depression, PTSD, severe anxiety, and DID. These range from a lack of health insurance (which I have now), as well as an unwillingness to admit that I'm sick and that I needed help. 

Yesterday while driving to work, I suffered a massive mental breakdown. I dissociated harder than I ever had before, and I was shaking so bad. I'm honestly surprised I was able to pull off the freeway and park without crashing/getting pulled over. It took me about an hour to come down, at which point I was able to drive home and then collapse for about 12 hours. 

I'm taking the rest of the week off work, and getting appts scheduled as soon as possible. It's time for me to get treatment. That was the scariest thing, and if I keep putting off being the person I really am, I really don't want to know what would happen. "
WintergreenGrin,asktransgender,Would anyone be interested in doing a mini-AMA with a trans woman (me) who has been full time without any problems for three years? I see so many questions on here from people just starting out and I want to help but I don't even know where to start.,"I know that my experience is unique to me and that I can't relate to every person's life situation, but I *have* successfully completed a MtF transition and have reached a point where I am never misgendered, I never have to use the men's facilities, and I generally just forget that I'm trans most of the time. 

I remember how tortured I was when I was first starting out. Weeks upon weeks of anxiety and turmoil, trying to find my own way. I didn't really have anyone to give me directions so I had to stumble through it on my own. I wished a lot, back then, that I had a trans woman friend who had already completed her transition. So I guess I'm here to try to be that friend to any other trans women (or anyone else) who may need some guidance or just want to bounce transition-related ideas off of someone experienced.

About me: I'm 29, American, I started transitioning at 24, and I went full time at 26. I want to get SRS done eventually, but I don't mind waiting. Pretty much everything about my transition ended up being better than I had imagined, which is great but it makes me want to give some encouragement to other ladies who are maybe not quite where I am yet.

I was dressed up and excited to greet the surgeon, waiting at the top of my driveway for pick up for 2 hours... The transportation never came and I was given excuse after excuse as to why. One man strongly expressed his discomfort with Miss Deadname and others told me they'd redirect me to the proper service but always hung up.

I already filed a complaint but this is handsdown my worst experience with Caresource yet, once more I grow to hate my stupid male dead name and the frustration it has caused me... especially with the fact my genital dysphoria is growing exponentially worse each passing day  and it just sucks.

After talking with the assistant of Dr. Unger and the LGBT Clinic staff it turns out the soonest Dr. Unger has an opening now is April... considering my initial appointment was February.. that hurt, that hurt a lot.

queersparrow,asktransgender,Where do you go for emotional support?,"Feel free to just answer the question without reading my long vent below.


When I was a teen, I always thought coming out was no big deal, and that my sexual orientation would just be unassumed until I chose to clarify it one way or another. When I came out to my mom as bi/queer, it went poorly; I'm assured that my family will love me no matter what, but I have no emotional support whatsoever - mom still acts like being queer is something I'll grow out of - and I haven't had the courage to come out to anyone else in my family. We don't acknowledge my relationship out loud; my partner is just ""my friend."" Between that and mom's obvious confusion and lack of understanding about trans people, I just can't bear to bring up my issues around gender. So family is out for me.

My main source of emotional support around LGBT+ issues has been my partner (and best friend), who I've been with for several years. They came out as a non-binary trans person a while ago (maybe two-ish years). It was pretty sudden, and caused some bumps in our relationship, due to us having very different experiences of gender. I thought we'd worked things out a bit - I've been doing my best to support them any way I can - and they've been working on legal, social, and recently medical transition. They've pressured me in the past to confront my own gender, but it takes me a long time to work through stuff for myself, and I was having a lot of trouble figuring things out for myself while also trying to be a supportive partner. I've come to the understanding that I am trans, albeit of extremely different experience than them, and wanted to talk to them about it, but was afraid to because of our past miscommunications about gender. Three days ago, we had a discussion about communication, and I expressed that I wanted to be more open with them. They told me that when I am closed off it makes them uncomfortable. So I told them I'd been giving it a lot of thought, and I'd like to try going on T. Two days ago we had a long talk about my gender, where I encouraged them to ask questions so we could clear stuff up and get on the same page. I mentioned that I need to get a therapist, and somehow our conversation devolved into accusations about me not getting a therapist earlier, then into them having a meltdown over our previous communications issues. Yesterday, they broke up with me (pretty much in their therapist's office, apparently, and then just let me know after they'd already made up their mind). I feel betrayed, because they asked me to open up, and when I did, this is what happened. But I'm also crushed and adrift, because they were my partner and my best friend and now I don't have them any more. 

I travel a lot, and I had a therapist who works with LGBT+ people and takes my insurance picked out, but I picked her because she works in the town where my now ex-partner lives, and that was the one place I always go back to. But since the one thing keeping me in that place is gone now, I really don't want to be anywhere near there any more, I just want to keep moving until I forget everything. Only I don't know how to have a therapist without settling down somewhere?

I want to talk to my friends, but they're all very cis, and they just kind of nod and agree whenever I mention stuff about gender. 

I feel like I worked so hard to get to a place of understanding my gender and knowing what I want to do about it, and I don't want to lose that progress, but now everything's just gone topsy turvy. I don't know where to turn. I just feel alone, like I should never come out to anyone ever again, because all it does is ruin my relationships with people I care about. :("
bong-cop,asktransgender,"Okay, how the HELL do I gain weight?!","I've always been really thin.

But... how the hell do I gain weight? This is something that is completely, COMPLETELY foreign to me. I'm so used to starving myself that the thought of eating three times a day still seems unnecessary, but holy hell do I ever need to if these pills are gonna work. 

So for those of you who were in my shoes, how did you gain weight? How did you set yourself up with the mindset to eat three times a day? How did you change your routine? What foods did you eat, and which ones did you avoid? Any help would be much appreciated, thank you :)

Personally, I have a very lovely friend. Ever since I came out to her, we've been so much closer. She's so sweet and she makes me feel welcome, and she knows what I truly am, but that doesn't matter to her. We talk every day, and she hugs me all the time, 

I was always scared to get close to girls, because i always thought that guys shouldn't get close to girls unless they were attracted to them. And considering ive never been attracted girls, I Just thought I had no place around them.

But after accepting myself and coming out, I've truly made a connection with another girl. And that's so special to me. I'm actually going to write a note expressing just how much I treasure our friendship and give it to her.

So, fellow trans people, do you have any supportive friends that you really care about?

AlexShadow21,asktransgender,How did you Know?,"For about the 22 years I've been alive, I knew something was different about me. I was born a female, but to this day I acted/dressed/and hung around with boys, but I was always called a tomboy. Throughout my middle/high school years I was fine with being called a tom boy, but once I started college, I realized I hated the term.

When I started college, I started watching FTM youtubers, and hearing their journey made me realize that a lot of what they were talking about, I could relate to so strongly. Body dysphoria was one that hit home so much for me, as my years being labeled a ""tomboy"" I would wear mens clothes, both pants and shirts, to cover up my body to make me look less feminine. I even have kept my hair in a short mohawk style hair cut for 10 years.

Where I live there is no LGBTQ groups, and the ones that are in my state are 5+ hours from my little apartment. I've looked for groups online but none of them have ever answered the one question I wonder about.

How did you know? or rather when did you realize that you were happier being the person you knew you were meant to be?"

becoming_madeline,asktransgender,"Ugh, this back and forth","For the last year, up until three months ago, I was in transition and going part time.  I had an appointment in January for HRT, but cancelled it.  

About November, I swung back hyper masculine, stopped transition, deleted every Internet foot print I had about being trans, unfollwed and left all the transfer groups I was apart of.  

I never gave it a second thought, was even embarrassed to use the word transgender with my gender therapist.  I grew a beard, shaved my head bald, threw away my breast inserts and clothes.  

During this time my wife and I have repaired our relationship, she's gotten a job and because of a work in jury I am a stay at home dad.  We love these roles, it works for us.  Just a note, my wife is supportive of me no matter how this goes, we agreed during my transition we wouldn't  divorce or if we did we would just live together and co-parent.

With all this being said, it hit me three or four days ago, just at the store I saw some panties on the rack and thought I'd look good in them and then boom!!!  It all came flooding back, I've been trying to find an equilibrium so I don't come off as unstable.  

I told my wife, she said she was expecting it to happen, even after I swore it would not.  She wasn't even bothered by, she didn't miss a beat and said nothing would change about our relationship. 

I know some of you must have gone through this, I just don't want to go back and forth, I mentally couldn't handle it.   I am not afraid of becoming her again or rather me again, I don't even know how to say it.  I just don't want to keep going back and forth for the rest of my life, but either way I can be at peace I just don't want to swing between hyper masculinity and transition.

by the way, my choice of words matters a lot. i dont choose them, they just sorta come out ""naturally"", but they are my prison because of my unawareness and lately worsening inability to feel (i think it was gradually declining over time due to arguable PTSD from this life and then i had a sharp decline in college)

for instance, i have to approach her in the right way about say, getting a haircut.  i mean, all my young life she urged me to get it cut short because it looks good short. so i started thinking it looks good short (i always hated it though, but i question the validity of my own emotions thanks to her, and my dad, and other relatives, and friends, and males in general, but anyway--).  sometimes i think i am a dog and am not trans at all (not literally a dog but i feel like i let myself get controlled like one, because idk why. i guess im a neko/furry/whatever but that's besides the issue) 

its kinda pitiful because im 22 and living at home after dropping out of college due to coming down with mental illnesses.  but anyway, today im cutting my split ends, and yesterday i talked about going to a hair dye specialist to get my hair colored.  she didn't say much, other than trying to get me to go to a generic haircut place to get it cut and colored at the same time for less.  i explained, shortly i admit, that i want to go to a specialist because they know how to match color with skin tone, and shade properly, and other niche things (and it would be with my own money, even tho i think i probly make her feel guilty about that without realizing it).  so today i go to the bathroom to try to trim my split ends myself (to save some money, and i honestly want to learn to ""dust"" (less than a trim, just the split ends) it myself--

see, "" "", i start mocking and hating on everything feminine because i hate myself, further because i was made to question myself further further because i needed encouragement from family/friends/society [cant expect that ive come to learn] when the opposite was given in return), and i decide to tell her im going to cut my own hair.  she says ""NoNoNo, i need the bathroom in the mornings"" (she's pretty OCD like that :/) and then im kicked out of the bathroom and then *she doesn't even use it for the next 30 minutes*.  fml rite?  so--before dinner i decide not to tell her (knowing she'll get suspicious of why im in the bathroom since she isn't informed of what im doing at all times), and we have an argument during dinner about how i feel broken and blah blah blah, and they say ""how can we help"" and i say well i feel controlled.  dad scoffs.  mom listens politely.  but things escalate for reasons ill blame myself for (and am mostly to blame, im such a damn leech on them, they always bring that up, and all they see is that i treat my mom bad and dont take me, the real me, into account so im always wrong but that's the thing itself that leads me to be mean to her, and to my dad, except its harder to be mean to him because idk, males, im ""beta"", not really but that's how i feel.  so then after dinner she goes into the bathroom and replaces *her shears* with her other shears, telling me i need to use those ones, they're better because they're sharper.  i said i was doing just fine with the other ones (but she really is OCD and protective of her things, that's fine, but jeez, i dont want to change myself just to be allowed to trim my own hair) 

suffice to say, im going to go buy my own shears.  xp

 i hate living here, but i have social anxiety and depression and a loss of emotional reactivity, and i get told that hormones are messing with my mind and i dont even feel good about taking the pills (hormones) but every once in awhile i feel pretty ok about being trans and that keeps me going, even tho at every turn im going against my upbringing, even tho they're verbally supportive.  run on sentence kms.  and its been two years and im expected to have got my life together by now and i haven't (and i dont even have my license because im a failure at life, got too nervous and hesitated too long the first test and failed for it, they woulda passed me if i was a girl i **just know it** ok, men need to be assertive, and the second time i was like an inch too far from the curb parallel parking so my very sweet aunt drives me to therapy every week and i hate being chauffered around i hate being a leech but here i am perpetuating my misery"
GabiCap,asktransgender,coming out when drunk?,"So I am newly realized I have dysphoria and a couple people know. For a couple weeks I thought about telling a co worker but then decided against it. But then....

After a few texts consisting of drunk ""high school drama"" even though we both in our mid-late twenties, I asked, ""Would it make us even if I gave you juice on my no one else has?"" And so I told her I'm trans.

Until that point it was pretty much hints that I was gay and liked girly things. And she seemed pretty happy I told her! Now I'm not sure if I should text her ""So.... about last night"" or say something at work, or just ignore it.

I have sensitive skin, I am very prone to razor burn and I almost always cut myself somewhere. Facial hair is my number 1 source of dysphoria and to see it gone, or more easily manageable, would make me a very happy girl. I will get laser hair removal at some point, but I can't quiet do that yet. So my question- is there anything i can do in the short term to manage this?

seekingcontemplation,asktransgender,Hormones/AA Question,"Hi all! 

Just a thought so far. Older Trans woman on the wrong side of her 30's here... I've been on low dose HRT at my request (1mg E, 5mg Finasteride, 50mg Spiro) for about a year now. Happy with the small changes, love what it's done for my once troublesome cystic acne and my skin. Not presently attempting to be ""out"", but considering in the future. 

I was just looking for any general advice, as I have an appt. coming up soon... and am wondering if any changes might be helpful, like upping spiro and dropping finasteride (I'd like to think I've done all I can with the hair loss issues, I think I'm one of those won't get any worse but not any better people). 

Anyway, It seems I'm a little more tired out quite often, which I'm wondering if I'm nuking T without much to replace it with, and if I'm just one of those that's quite sensitive to Anti Androgens, because isnt this a relatively low dose combo? Especially since pre low dose hrt I was pretty high T (with fin only). 

Any advice? Could I maybe get better hair loss regrowth with more spiro/no Finasteride? Etc?

GilerToad,asktransgender,Unisex icon - inclusive of transgender?,"Hi all,

I have just launched a natural skincare and grooming brand that is intended to be used by everyone and be completely inclusive. As most many differentiate it was my intention to use the unisex logo which combines the male and female circles with cross at the bottom and arrow at the top. 

I have put a draft  on the site today www.london-natural.co.uk if you can't envision it.

A friend suggested to me today that this unisex icon might offend some in the transgender community as it doesn't include transgender- the opposite of my intent. I assumed the icon was all encompassing.

Is this true or is it tiptoeing unnecessary?

I would be grateful for any guidance on this issue so I can communicate the right message.

Thank you for any advice.

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,Somewhat Out and Dysphoria (TW/NSFW-ish),"It was actually the very same day that I made my last post but the thing is, It wasn't on my terms at all and I had absolutely no intention to tell anyone for quite awhile longer but now I am on the road towards getting a therapist but I don't really feel much better, at all, I am happy that I will be able to see a therapist about this eventually and I haven't been kicked out of my house but, I don't feel much brimming confidence in having any of them know.

My parents are liberal and seemingly accepting but I am unhappy so far about talking to them about any of it, such as when I mention that cis people don't question their gender for months on end but they usually reply with something like 'Yes they can and they do' and I am like, 'Okay I guess..."" and things like this have happened a few more times and I make references to other accounts of trans people I've read and they say ""Don't be so consumed about giving yourself a label, you don't know if people on the internet are telling the true story and you shouldn't be over-researching it"" of course they said this in a much nicer way but it only hurts me when they say it, even if I wanna give myself a label, maybe you should just let me and I've been on the internet most of my life, I know how to navigate it and the things I refer to about trans stuff is usually not scientific papers but real life accounts of other trans people that I RELATE with. I am not just shouting random things about being transgender as well if they are worried about me 'over-researching' either I have gotten nowhere near what they mean and never will or that went out of the window two months ago.

They are nice and I paraphrase what they said into a shorter version, they say it much nicer usually but still... I am NOT happy that they know about it as I AM still questioning but I am more sure than I am not sure and I imagine a lot of it just needs me to see a therapist about it to clear it all up, but now with them, I FEEL like they are silently judging, I know they probably aren't but I still feel like they are and I feel terrible, because I FEEL like a spoiled brat who should probably have just stayed quiet and been the 'prodigy' child of the family.

Like I've said before in previous posts, I don't really know why I want to be a girl, but I don't have any reason I'd ever want to stay a boy besides ""It's easier to"" and this is where I get into my 'dysphoria' if you could call it that. I am going to list off things I think are dysphoria as well as other things that I need answers to.

* I hate taking off my glasses because it's takes away the only distraction away from my masculine features like my jawlines and brows and I find myself much happier when I feel that my face looks more feminine BUT I am not always bothered by it (which I explain later why I HATE this).

* I can't really say if I have the stereotypical 'gentital' dysphoria, I've found recently now that I've been questioning I hate having erections (yet testosterone makes me love it &gt;:c) and I have tried to tuck (unsuccessfully) as well as I have had passing thoughts of removal or destruction of my genitals but, I don't have a constant HATE of them, mostly because they are small (no shame there) and if I did something drastic, I wouldn't ever be able to have a vagina and finally, I think I've experienced post-coital tristesse for years, maybe even since I first hit puberty but I don't know how much this really means or is it just a common thing?

* I don't like/don't WANT to like my male sex drive, but testosterone doesn't seem to like that type of thinking because it's hard not to think about sex sometimes and unlike a decent amount of people I've seen around here (I know ALOT of people don't do it but there does seem to be enough people to mention it) but I've never already been exposed to trans porn (and still haven't) though I do find myself sticking to places like lesbians and such, though minimally because I avoid masturbation and usually only do it twice a week on average. In addition, most people say they can't do it without imaging their penis as a vagina but it is almost impossible for me to do that, it's just so obvious that I have a penis and I DO hate thinking about PiV sex with me having the penis but it's also almost impossible to imagine myself TRULY being in the female position because my penis is like ""Heeeeeeeeey, I see you there... can't forget about me, just take this testosterone and there won't be any problems, you see?"" and I HATE it, most of the time I am forced (by testosterone) to imagine myself in male position for a second, it's not me, just some random figure that I usually can't see the top half of, because I am legitimately disgusted by the thought of ME, MY body doing something like that.

* I actually HATE myself when I feel fine as well, I am afraid that my transness will just walk up and disappear on me, leaving me cis and it makes me want to have MORE dysphoria so that I can actually constantly feel like I am trans for sure and I can just start making my way to changes. I WANT for it to be clearer to me whether it comes in acceptance/clarity or a crap-ton of dysphoria which I imagine most people would be asking to NOT have, which makes this sound absolutely stupid.

* I don't like to see facial hair and I like to see it gone (I look more feminine), but sometimes when I am between shaving it, I'll be feeling it for some reason (only the sideburn area, when I am leaning on my hand) and be like ""I don't know how to feel about this at all..."" and I don't like it.

* I can't provide any reason for why I would want to keep a male body as well, if I had a choice, I don't I wouldn't have reason for either really but, I'd choose female. I would rather see myself with feminine proportions and parts, I don't like my tall and brooding nature, as if I am a Englishman straight out of the nearest pub (I am not dissing Englishmen! Most of my family is English and I am just saying I wouldn't want to be them because ya know, trans :/ but take it as a compliment because I think of them when I think strong masculinity, not saying that they ALL have to be super masculine so yeah...)

* I am scared that I will suppress it all and find myself in my thirties and have it all come up again and I don't want that to happen, I want to do something now, whether it IS HRT or for now therapy. I feel maybe I am too focused on looks and not focused on the social, though, I've never really been social AT ALL.

* Other times, I AM thinking about the social part of transition, I remember how I have never really been masculine and I have never really liked masculine things and now, I just hope that somehow I can morph into a more feminine and considerate person who can actually talk to people once in a awhile.

* I sometimes want my parents to stop saying my given name but I would feel guilty about it because I am just questioning, I would feel weird about it probably and I don't even have something like a name thought up and I think it would be very rude to try and ask for something like that, as well if they say no or wait, I will just feel bad about it and as well I think ""You'll probably just be fine without it, it doesn't REALLLLLLY bother you"" a lot of the time and just stop thinking of it as a possibility besides having a very SLIM idea of what I might like (Josie, Jennifer, Sophie, Sophia, Zara, Veronica) but I don't think any of them could ever fit. 

* Sometimes, I hate listening to my own voice, but sometimes I don't! Which confuses me on why, though I find if I sigh, grunt or anything like that, it's usually much worse and more often it bothers me.

* I don't really know but, is there a difference between suicidal thoughts and actual suicidal motives? Because I would be lying if I didn't think about suicide sometimes but, I still have a sense of self-preservation, I am not walking into roads without looking but I am thinking about it and have thought of many ways that it could be done, but no true intention to do anything stupid anytime soon. Also, is it that bad I lied to the general practitioner (who will probably be my new family doctor) about having such thoughts, I don't think much of them as of now.


I know people say dysphoria comes in waves and such, but what is it supposed to feel like when you are in the calm of the storm? I just want to be sure of myself but I don't even know when that will happen. Does anyone have anything that they can relate to?

Can I still be trans? Or is this something else? If I transition will I have made a mistake and want to go back? I mean it seems absolutely out of the question, the sheer fucking joy of waking up one day as a woman would suggest otherwise. But I dont actually *know*

Lately I have become more and more secure in the fact that I am a girl and I seem to have a resolve to transition but this also for some reason scares me. I still worry that maybe I am wrong, maybe there is some other reason I am thinking like this, Maybe I am delusional? All of these horrible and shitty comments I am reading all over the place just keeps this fire burning and now I am even questioning if this is real. All the comments about ""mutilating your body"" and ""you will still be male regardless"" makes me feel like shit.. Being trans is a real thing and I want to believe it but my internalised transphobia like I said just keeps using this as an argument.. It took me a lot to get over the feeling that ""I will never be 100% a biological female"" but now that work seems to come undone due to a few stupid people on the internet.

Songus,asktransgender,Did anyone else have their lives changed by a cheap pair of tights,"I bought a cheap pair of tights today and tried them on. I did it mostly as a bit of a thrill but it's turned into so much more.

The way they feel is extraordinary, like the most comfortable and natural clothes I've ever worn. I love looking down and seeing them and the way they feel against sheets. 

This has made me want to try more girls clothes, particularly boots and skirts. It's no longer a kink thing, they are just the clothes I think I'll feel most comfortable in. I've felt so clouded and depressed lately but these cheap tights have taught me the most important lesson of my life. I want to be a woman.

Zeuphrosyne,asktransgender,My friend is shaming me for the eventual surgeon I may choose,"Hi, 

I(17)have a friend(25)who is mtf like me and who sent me multiple hurtful messages because I told her that I could not go to Thailand with Chett for multiple reasons, mainly because of financial issues. Indeed, I will see Dr Monstrey in Belgium(By the way if you have informations about him, I would gladly take them) and I will maybe choose him but the thing is that like every other surgeons (correct me if I'm wrong) that isn't Chett or Suporn, he's using the penile inversion technic.

 And since my friend planned her operation with Chett in a few months and always idealised him, she's telling me in details that I will never have a great vagina because of the method used, that I will have no sensations in my vagina, that it won't be good looking, that because I like men they (sorry it is a little bit explicit) will never be able to enter me because I will only have a 3 inches depth... She said things like :
 ""Don't ruin your life"" 
""I know for experience that men will reject you if your vagina isn't good looking and if they can't have a traditional intercourse with you"" 
""You can save up money if you want, you just have to push yourself, find a job.. do you think other trans girls have it easy?"" (When would I be able to, I just can't I'm just 17 and I'm going to begin extremely hard studies)

She thinks Chett and Suporn are the best in the world because of their technics and we can't have an objective discussion about it.  Now I think about how maybe she is right, that I won't have a great sexual life because of a failed surgery, how when people will see my future genitalia, they will know that I wasn't born with it..

What should I do? Even on this sub it's like there is an idealisation of the Thai technics.. Should I wait almost 10 years to gather enough money (I have to do my studies first) and live with my current genitalia that I despise in order to go to Thailand because apparently they are the best. ..?"
ImHereSoIDntGetFound,asktransgender,I definitely understand passing privilege now,"So I pass pretty well.  During a month of full time I've never been clocked or misgendered.  There were two instances of misgendering when someone was dealing with my dead name, so I don't really count those, and one questionable time in a bathroom when I was sweaty and weird looking for some reason, but I don't think that had to do with my gender.  That changed today.

I was out shopping and looking at shoes when some lady calls her daughter in a nervous tone.  The store was basically empty so when I heard someone talking I looked over at her, and she was looking at me with a scared expression.  Oh good, I'm not a girl, I'm a big bad man who's trying to rape kids or something.  Sigh...

As the title states, I now understand and appreciate the privilege I have by (usually) passing so well.  I can go about my business without being questioned, stared at, and just generally assumed to be a woman like I am.  I really feel for the people who have to face this struggle on a daily basis and can't even go to the store without being seen as a freak.  To those of you who don't pass and are treated poorly because of it, I'm so, so sorry. :(  I now know how awful it feels and I hope that you're one day viewed as the wonderful and true person that you are.

Has this happened to anyone else?

6yyyy,asktransgender,Its really weird sounding like a girl. [Yeson VFS],"I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this so I'm telling you guys, sorry for the blog post. 

I'm 33 days post OP from Yeson Voice Feminization Surgery with Dr. Kim, I've been taking for about 3 days now. Learning how to talk all over again feels so.... weird. It's like someone else is talking for me, my voice doesn't recognize the sound coming out as my own. My brain keeps trying to go lower but it physically can't, my male pitch is gone, if I try and talk super low like a guy it just cuts out. 

Right now I sound super raspy (hoping that goes away as time goes on) and anything more than short conversation makes my cords tired. I still expect my old voice to come out but it doesn't, it's someone else's voice, well, my voice now.

I'll try and do before afters at the 2 or 3 month mark, because right now, talking is such a big task and the raspyness is harsh. 

I've been to embarrassed to talk with my mother or father or brothers, I'm not sure why. I feel embarrassed about having a females voice, it doesn't feel like mine yet. They all really wanna hear my voice but I told them I would after I figure how to use it correctly. 

Is the raspyness normal? Did anyone else get super shy *right* after VFS? "
tao-nui,asktransgender,Coming out through Skype?,"Hi there,

My mom is really far away, as well a dear friend that I feel the need to come out to before making the leap, like 10 000km away. I don't know when I will have an opportunity to go back to my family to come out, and it's bugging me.

Somedays I feel like ""fuck it, let's call them through Skype"". I'm supposed to begin my transition in the next couple of months but this is holding me back.

I'm afraid. Is it a good idea? I feel like telling them Irl would be the only way for me to get that done properly, but I'm kind of stuck with a dilemma.

HiImRebecca,asktransgender,Any tips on dealing with intense romantic loneliness?,"Hi! I'm just gonna jump into it.

I've always felt kinda lonely, since I have yet to do anything romantically with anyone. Pre-HRT, I was pretty good at making it not a problem by repressing my feelings, and even though I got crushes on people, I always found them to be impossible for me to pursue: before I came out to myself, I used the excuse that they were too attractive for me, and after coming out to myself, I've only gotten crushes on straight girls, so that's literally impossible for me. So even though I sometimes felt sad about it, it wasn't really a problem.

But like a month or two ago after starting HRT, I started getting this craving for physical touch and cuddling. It wasn't too bad, but it basically replaced whatever sexual feelings towards people I had! And up until Saturday, I knew how to deal with this, by basically ignoring it and hugging people a bit more!

I'm not really sure, what triggered this, but I think me seeing so many people making out on Friday was probably part of it. Either way, on Saturday evening, I began to feel so incredibly lonely, and that ""cuddle craving"" I mentioned earlier became so intense! I don't know how long I cried for (and I spend even longer holding back tears), but in the end, I just gave up on everything and went to bed at 9pm.

Sunday wasn't better, I already felt pretty badly, when I woke up, but I kept myself distracted all day by reading [Rain](http://rainlgbt.smackjeeves.com/) for the first time. However, when I reached the end in the evening, it didn't take long for my feelings to come back, and I probably ended up crying for an hour and a half combined, while the rest of the time between 9pm-12am was spend trying not to cry. So I tried the whole ""going to bed to fix things""-trick again. Which didn't work the last time, so why should it now?

And it didn't work this time either. I would've probably stayed home today, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to show up to be able to choose my group for our 1st year project at my uni. So I went, and I was so close to breaking down a few times today. I still haven't cried properly today, but I've been really close to several times since I got home.

What is even happening to me?! I'm wishing so hard to have a girlfriend, that loves me, to cuddle with. But that's not how the world works, and this whole thing is ridiculous! How can I overcome this, without, you know, doing the obvious solution and try to find someone to date, which I'm really not ready for?

Help..?"

Futurist110,asktransgender,Can one have an androgynous gender identity?,"Can one have an androgynous gender identity?

Basically, I had some more time to think a lot about my own gender identity recently as a result of me being largely bedridden (due to some illness; I'm currently working on figuring it out). Anyway, though, what I've concluded (indeed, perhaps ""confirmed"" is the better word here) is that I want to have a body and face where I can be viewed by people as male, as female, as both male and female, and as neither male nor female. Basically, I want to have an androgynous body and face which could give different/various people different impressions of my own gender identity.

Anyway, could I have an androgynous gender identity? I mean, I don't want a body and face which is either fully male or fully female; rather, I want something which (other than my genitals) is in-between the male and the female.

Any thoughts on this?"
_hannakon,asktransgender,An introduction and some questions - how the heck do I start?,"Hi everyone! I've lurked here for long enough so I figured I might as well go ahead and jump in too. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I'm a trans girl, but I kind of have no idea where to start and am feeling kind of overwhelmed. I'm in Canada (Metro Vancouver outside of Vancouver Coastal Health area), for reference.

The first thing I want to do is be able to talk to a gender therapist to start to work through things, but since I'm a poor student and don't plan to come out to my parents any time soon, expensive private places are off the table. I was thinking of trying the only place that offers free counselling to people outside the VCH area (Catherine Holman), but obviously that's not a viable long-term solution. Anyone been in the same boat and have advice? Even if it doesn't pertain to where I am, I want to hear other peoples' experiences.

I also have the problem of all the hair on the top of my head beginning to show signs of thinning (although I'm ahead of the curve relative to the other male members of my family). What's the easiest way to get myself on finasteride ASAP? Doctor's appointment? My GP is the doctor for my entire family, so I'm not sure I want to go down that route, are there any other options...?

I've also been reading up a lot on how to shave my legs and stuff, really excited to be able to do that when I'm alone in the house this week. 

It's been tough, and it only gets tougher from here, but I think I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Right now I'm just happy to be able to hang out here, what an amazing supportive community c:"
atheist_observer_,asktransgender,Confused about my gender and about my Sexuality.,"Hi all,i am a 21 year old male. Ever since my childhood...i have had conflicting opinions about my sexuality. I remember starting to mastubate from the age of 7. I used to mastubate by fantasising about me being a Woman and pleasing a man. This has always been like this. I would occasionally mastubate to women but almost all my fantasies predominantly involve I being magically transformed into a woman and having sex with a man. However,in my normal day to day life...i am attracted to women and not men. 



Hence,i have been confused about my Sexuality since my mid teens. For now,i think that i am a Blanchard's Transexual.....but i am utterly confused. It would be real helpful if someone could give some inputs as to what i really am. Am i a Transgender? Am i a Homosexual? Or am i a straight man?"

idfklmao,asktransgender,"I (biological male, very early 20s) suspect I'm transgender, and I don't like any of my options","Having things other people want but I don't has kind of been the story of my life. I'm very attractive, I have a partner that's perfect in every way and I have awesome friends. 

As a kid I was raped, and had a lot of really weird stuff done to me. I don't remember any dysphoria before that, so I imagine that to be what started it. 

I'm bisexual but I prefer heterosexual porn because I imagine myself in the woman's PoV. I don't just want women, I want to *be* them. I love women's clothing. My masculine features make me extremely insecure. All of this makes me really insecure and depressed. I'm barely functional and I feel like my brain is going to implode.

I don't want to be trans, I just want to be a girl. HRT sounds like such a shitty compromise, and I could regret it and permanently fuck up the objectively excellent body I have, but I don't think I can go on like this. 

I love my partner more than I thought anyone could love another person. All I want is for him to be happy, because he didn't just make me happy, he showed me what happiness *is*. He's an incredibly intelligent and perceptive person, but also genuine, open and considerate all the time. He has no bad side. I've been with him for four+ years and he's never treated me poorly, not even out of anger or stress.

I can't hide anything from him, he always knows when something is bothering me, and he always says ""what's wrong?"" in his recognizable soft, warm, concerned tone, and I go silent because I can't speak without breaking down and sobbing. I don't want to burden him with my problems. I don't want him to worry about me, I wish he didn't care about me. I want to free myself from this life, and free him from myself, but I know losing me would break him, and I can't do that.

I feel bitter about meeting him. I've never felt more bitter about anything in my life. Ever day I wish we had never met and he had a happy life without me to burden him. I would be so happy and relieved if he told me he doesn't care about me and never wants to talk to me a gain, but I know he never will.

I asked him a while ago as an idle question how he would feel if I was trans, and he said he wouldn't care, but I still worry how it would affect the dynamic of our relationship, and I don't want to bother him with my problems. I wish I could die without him ever finding out.

I could kill myself so easily. I have exactly what I need and I know exactly what to do. I have no survival instinct and I'm desensitized to pain. It would be so easy to end this cruel joke of a life, but I can't do it because it would break the person I love. This is such a fucking cruelty.

I hate this so fucking much. I don't know what to do.

HazelCheese,asktransgender,It feels like my brain just flipped a switch. I can't even think right now.,"I realised I might be transgender (mtf) about 3 - 4 months ago. I've never had any physical dysphoria, only the repeating idea that I'd prefer to be a girl. I started seeing a therapist and everything about it has been mostly positive. Last week I felt better than i have in my entire life and I told my best friend. It went better than I could ever have imagined. 

And then on Monday I felt like a piece of shit. And its getting worse and worse and worse. I've felt these cycles of questioning before now but never as intense as this. Just feeling the wig on my head or seeing the makeup on my face or feeling my sports bra makes me feel disgusting. 

It's almost a reverse body dysphoria. Seeing myself dressed up in the mirror and photos is horrible. Yet when I take it all off it and look at myself again I don't feel better or like it. It just is and I just don't hate it. And yet wanting to take my wig off makes me hate myself even more because then I'm fake and don't really want it.

I feel like I've gone through a phase and telling my friend caused it to wear off. I thought I had figured out what was wrong with my life and now I'm crying to depressing music because I don't even feel like I want it. Like. I want it, I think I do, but I don't feel like I want it? What the fuck is happening. I can't even think straight.

I can't see my therapist till next tuesday and I'm terrified I'm not even going to be able to drive by that point. My brain just won't shut the fuck up. It's impacting my performance at work. Does taking off the shelf headache medication help with this? "
georgemitch,asktransgender,This is me.,"I've never been attracted to a woman before I met this girl in my class. I am attracted to men and I am very very ashamed of myself, because I know I am a very disappointing son in my parent's eyes.

My parents want me to marry a woman, have kids and build a family. I myself like kids too, only a woman can give me biological kids, so I try very hard to suppress my desire for guys. I have never dated a guy before. I've had crushes on a few, but I never got a date because the guys I've had crushes on are all straight.

The reason I love this girl in my class:

I've never felt like this towards a woman before. I am very happy I am finally attracted to a woman. She makes me think about her day and night, I really love her. I want to be straight because I don't want to be a shame to my family. I thought I am finally not gay anymore. Although my feelings for her are strictly platonic, I love her and want to be with her. She has changed my life. 

Need to clarify on one thing first: I only crossdress secretly. The long hair you saw is a wig. It doesn't look fake because it is a very high quality one. It took me a long time to save up enough to buy it. I don't go to school like this. My parents are transphobic. My dad would kick me out of the house if he knows I am gay.

I want to be heterosexual so much. But who am I kidding? I made a post about my mom freaking out after looking through my phone. Because I was browsing male nude on my phone. I write about how much I like this girl on the internet every day, yet I watch such things afterwards. I am not sexually attracted to women at all. I have never had any sexual fantasies over this girl. I just want to be around her and talk to her. She has smiled to me very kindly, I am recovering from my medical condition because of her. I really love her.

About my medical condition: Its throat pain. I have throat pain due to voice training. I was very unhappy at high school because the guy I liked didn't like me back. We were very very good friends, our personality was a great match, I very surely knew if I were a girl, he would date me. My hatred for women started at that time. I am jealous of girls. Why can they get guys but I can't. So I decided I want to become a girl too. I want to be prettier than them.

So as a first step I started to train my voice when my parents were not at home, I had great successes, perhaps due to the fact that I have a rather feminine voice to begin with. I started to try to raise my usual speaking pitch bit by bit, thinking my parents wouldn't notice. But they noticed. I was forced to drop back to a manly pitch. I was so depressed. I got very used to speaking in a high pitch, I felt very comfortable that way, I couldn't do a lower pitch anymore. But they forced me to and I had to oblige. The pain and inflammation started at that time.

The pain lasted five years. Until I sat in the class and met this girl. She smiled to me, I don't know why, I felt very happy. There are other girls that smile to me too. I actually believe I am quite attractive as a male. But I don't like them at all. I don't know how to react when I say something and then they giggle like they are embarrassed. The reason I say I couldn't interact with women is because I had to go to school dressing as a man, I had to fake a masculine personality but I am not attracted to women. I don’t know how to react when women treat me like a man. And also I was still angry and jealous towards women, I didn't like to talk to them. Especially Stacys. My high school crush used to show me pictures of him going out with a Stacy from another school. This is why I hated Stacys so much.

Now I am not angry at women anymore. I realised how twisted my thoughts and opinions are after meeting this girl in my class. Although revenge and hatred might be the reason I started crossdressing secretly, now I am not doing it out of hatred anymore. I truly wish I were a girl, because I want to feel loved by a guy.

But this is not possible. I want to live an easy life. I am biologically a male, I should find a woman to marry and have kids. I love kids. I want to have a family with a woman. I know I can be romantically attracted to woman too. I want to be straight. I am in huge distress.

After getting my chemical AP degree in Hungary, I plan on moving to Århus for a top-up for my AP to equal BsC and finally start my master's. 

As Hungary is rather... conservative and hostile towards anything LGBT (socially, legally it's actually surprisingly progressive), I do not dare to do anything more than toy with hair and blame it on fashion.

In Denmark though, with the law rewording and general impression of the society, I am thinking of outing myself from day 0 even before getting to start HRT, as it's been way too long delayed. Of course, doing so as tastefully as my body shape allows, doing exercise/losing weight to make it more allowable.

With that, the reason I'm asking this question is: Would I face any discrimination from the Århus Academy during an English course of Chemical and Biotechnical Top-up course, and in Århus university itself during my master's (in case of not getting to start HRT even then)? What about from stores, gyms and stuff like that?"

stasisorchange,asktransgender,I've made my decision.,"Hi everybody! Another wall of text incoming. This one's a bit different than the last, though.

I still don't know if I'm actually trans or not. Still not sure whether I'm (mentally speaking) an effeminate man, a tomboyish girl, or a true nonbinary who just happens to prefer the idea of living in a female body. But given how depressed I've been, and how close I've come to suicide, I'm certain of one thing - I definitely, certainly, absolutely, without any question whatsoever, DO NOT want to continue being a man anymore. My feelings of inferiority regarding my body, my distaste for masculine behaviors, and my total lack of success in the male gender role (socially, sexually, and financially) WILL end up killing me if I remain a man - and sooner rather than later, because these problems can't be fixed. I'll never be able to grow a full beard - I don't have enough facial hair (people say my goatee attempts look like pubic hair on my face - one person even called it a mouth vagina). No surgery exists to fix my tiny penis. I'll never be a fan of drinking games or competitive bragging or sports or gym workouts. I'll never find a girlfriend or get married - I don't have the social skills to out-compete (*other?*) men. I'll never get to find out what it's like to have sex (or even kiss - I'm THAT inexperienced, and that undesirable). I'll never be rich or have a prestigious job or in any other way accomplish anything worth respecting regarding work - and this one in particular hurts most, as nearly every one of my peers has started a career that is either lucrative or prestigious. In short, I can't accept this state of affairs any longer.

And so, we come to the key point. **It no longer matters if I'm trans or not - I need to transition anyway.** Hope is often a poisonous commodity, tricking us into believing that tomorrow can be better than today, but in some ways, all I have left is hope. Hope for a better future, hope that I'll find that femininity suits me, hope that I can start over and do things differently. *Hope that this time, I'll finally get it right.* After all, what's the worst that could happen? I regret transition? Well, damn, in a life comprised of nothing but regrets, that'll really stick out, won't it? 

If I stay male, I'll die. If I transition and regret it, I'll die. But if I transition and find it suits me, I've finally found happiness - and for someone who can't remember what happiness feels like, that's all that really matters in the end.

I'm a trans woman, not because I want to be, but because I have to be if I want to live to see tomorrow. Life is a vast, dark tunnel, but I hold the light of hope in my heart, guiding me forward towards a new dawn. Maybe I'll stumble ... maybe I'll fall ... maybe the light will go out, and the spark of life that I call ""me"" will drown in the crushing blackness of despair and misery ... but these are not guarantees, and this journey may yet end with light and laughter and love.

Either way, I will hold my head up high and face whatever comes next. Either way, my journey ends. Either way, I will find peace. And ultimately, isn't peace what we all want most?

worriesthrowaway,asktransgender,Should I take Bicalutamide?,"So....after about eight months of saying ""something's wrong with me, my blockers are working less and less"" and getting ignored and gaslit by my doctor and me getting increasingly scared and suicidal, she might finally prescribe me Lupron in two weeks, but she might not, and in the meantime.....I'm not doing great. 

I've been taking 400mg spiro -and- 100mg cyproterone together out of desperation, and it's still not doing the job. I added .5mg Avodart about a week ago, but that just takes care of DHT. The only other option I have right now is some 50mg bicalutamide (I asked my dr. about trying it several months ago and she was like sure okay, i took it for about a week, and then switched back to cypro because I didn't have insurance at the time and was worried I wouldn't be able to stay on it), and I was wondering....

Is using Bicalutamide as an AA a bad idea if I haven't had an orchi or SRS? I read something about it ""significantly raising androgen levels,"" so I'm pretty nervous about making things even worse, especially after spending the last month watching a ton of hair inexplicably fall out.

Can anybody share their experiences on Bicalutamide? Does it make your sex drive hard to ignore? (this is one of the things giving me a ton of dysphoria right now, along with thicker ejaculate coming back, so i'm really worried about that) Any nasty side effects?

If I take it, should I take it with cypro (or spiro) to take care of the T floating around or would that not really help?

Thanks in advance. :x

Also, please please please nobody say ""talk to your doctor."" I've tried, multiple times, over several months. It really really really hasn't gone well."
Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,[Serious] How did you make the time go by earlier in your transition? I feel like hormones are going to take forever.,"I know I just started, and that's part of the problem. 

I think it could be years before I can pass, and I'm tired of waiting, but the thought is constantly on my mind. 

Should I ask to get my dosage increased? I was started on a very low dose (25mg spiro, 1mg E)

I don't feel anything. It's like I'm literally taking sugar pills.

Edit: should I double the dose (2x2; 2 1mg E pills twice a day, and 1 spiro pill twice a day) to increase the feminizing effect? Should I also take E under the tongue, instead of swallowing? 

Also, what can I eat, or what exercises can I do to get a more feminine body shape?"
trans_rights,asktransgender,[Update] Having issues with my hormone doctor. Good and Eh? news!,"Hey all! Here is a link to my original post [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5sj91b/having_issues_with_my_hormone_doctor/). Quick recap, I'm a 22 year old MTF on about 10 months of HRT. My old doctor had me on a pretty low dose of at least spiro since month 3 even though my levels weren't getting normalized. I was annoyed at here and was seeking a second opinion. Also sorry for the wall of text, I've got a lot going in my brain! ;P

Now as for my update. A lot has happened in the past 10 or so days! My original hormone doctor now refuses to even talk to me about increasing my spiro and gets annoyed whenever I bring it up, when I can even get in contact with her that is. My insurance also officially turned down me getting patches so that's not happening.

I have gone to the informed consent clinic by me and they were absolutely fantastic! They were immensely confused by what my first doctor had to say about spiro and even took out their printed and full of notes copy of some transgender standards of care. 

She then said she would take some blood tests and increase both my Estrogen and Spiro. The blood tests unfortunately came back this morning and I am not at all where I should be. I as of  Monday have 64 pg/ml of estrodial in my system and 630 NG/DL of testosterone. 

With these new blood tests it gives a completely different picture to my previous ones which were unnerving with super high estrogen. Now it seems as though my T isn't being suppressed nearly enough and I definitely needed a Spiro increase.

I am now on 6mg of Estrodial and 200mg of Spiro. But I've also been on these hormones for 10 months now and am absolutely terrified that because my T is so high and E isn't high enough at this stage that its more like I'm at 6 months. Are these levels normal for someone at my stage? Will the new levels of hormone pills help? Does me having such high T at such a late stage essentially mean I've been on super slow hrt if you can even call it that? Am I too late to get the full effects of MTF HRT? 

All these questions worry me and as I am not able to talk to my doctor about this until Monday I have come to you lovely guys and gals to ask for advice and get some perspective. Thanks so much all!

Bonus Question: what would you all recommend to quell some worry until my new dosage starts taking hold?

Edit: forgot the zero for my t levels. "

TransPanda4,asktransgender,Did anyone else experience this? (NSFW),"A bit of backstory: 

I'm MtF.  When I was in high school and didn't know I was trans, I figured I was just attracted to girls.  Freshmen year of college I realized I was probably Demi.  Sophomore year I realized I was trans, but still just Demi and into girls.  Now about a year later, I'm extremely pan and after my first sexual encounter, I would honestly call myself an closeted Slut.  I'm asexual, and get no sexual pleasure from most sexual activities, but I really enjoy performing oral.  I want to just go down on like everyone ever, just for curiosity's sake.  I'm in a committed relationship and we safe happy, but the main thing I don't get to experience with her is giving a blowjob.
I really want to give someone a blowjob ever since I received my first one, and I think being trans has something to do with it.  Maybe it feels like a right of passage?  Idk, but I really want to.  Anyone have a similar experience?

SeraphOfShadows,asktransgender,How can I learn to trust myself?,"I have difficulty organizing my thoughts, so sorry if this is hard to follow.

Right now, I am fairly certain that I am transgender. I tend to be very indecisive in general, and I feel like I lack general self-awareness. I have aspergers and ADD, and am very socially awkward.

I just turned 23 a few days ago. I started wanting to be a girl about 6 or 7 years ago, and I remember in the early days feeling strong hatred towards masculinity. For years, I wished and prayed to become a girl, and constantly fantasized about being transformed or reborn. For the longest time, I only had a vague idea of what it meant to be transgender, and I believed that any existing options like surgery would only mask the symptoms, not cure me.

Less than a year ago, I started researching after coming out to a psychiatrist during an unrelated evaluation. I became hopeful that I found the answers, but I also became worried that I am misinterpreting the signs. I saw a therapist during the Spring and Summer, but due to scheduling conflicts, I couldn't continue during the Fall. Instead, I attended a group at my university, which was a nice experience.

As I tried to explore my thoughts and feelings, I became more aware of various issues impeding introspection. First, I have a very poor memory. My past is a haze of vague impressions and small random scenes. I am not aware of my emotions most of the time, with only brief moments of anxiety, sadness, or random happiness sticking out. I recently considered that I may be depressed when I realized that emotional numbness or emptiness is a possible symptom. This surprised me, as I am generally carefree and excitable. I began to consider that I use video games, television, and fantasies to distract myself. Analyzing my thoughts became harder and harder because I could not determine their source. I have grown very tired of my analytical mind and long for emotions, and I have abandoned my attempts to rationalize my desires long ago.

I have been growing out my hair since the summer, and I shave my legs. When I look in the mirror, most of the time I have no reaction. Sometimes, I appear masculine and feel sad, while other times I see femininity and feel happy and hopeful. With my hair growing out, I see the feminine sides more often, and I no longer feel hopelessly masculine. I seem to be growing more comfortable with thinking of myself as a girl, but part of me feels like I'm not reliable and that I can't trust my answers to these questions."
EloiseSkye,asktransgender,"Going ""full time"" without a passable voice","I'm planning on coming out fairly soon and switching up my wardrobe, making it a lot more feminine/androgynous as well as going by they pronouns and my new name (which is a female name, not unisex).

KuribohGirl,asktransgender,I've just been presented the perfect oppertunity for petty revenge,"Back story, this was 3 years ago. I'd started transitioning within the last few months. Got into an argument with a close friend about and she said ""I'm not calling you Tomoko, oldname. It's not your legal name""  Ouch. Anyway she was a close friend but after that argument we stopped talking. I've seen her since but not spoken really just a quick ""oh hey it's you *gives me awkward hug*"".


Anyway. Fast forward. Added on fb. 
Except...wait what's that? She has a brand new name! I figured maybe she's trans, unisex name. Turns out no...but the new name has a really personal story attached to it. I really want/ed to just say ""Not going to call you Ash, Jenny. It's not your legal name."" Then defriend and block. I won't do because I'm not angry and there's no reason to ruin a newly repaired friendship(""Give you my number so we can talk more[...] we were close.""-her in this chat. My feels.) . It's damn tempting though. 


**Bonus points everyone keeps fucking up her name and it upsets her a little, which is a nice taste of her own medicine.**


I missed her, she missed me (;-;), I'm glad to have a pre-transition friend back. It would be irl too except now I live quite a while away(she did say we should meet up too).

1ofthosetimes,asktransgender,Did i lose someone to transition?,"I have this feeling that my transition has resulted in losing a friend. So a bit of backstory... 

He's a cis gender conforming gay guy i've known since 2009 and for the bulk of that time i've seen him roughly every week or so. He was actually the second person i came out to but not exactly in the best of circumstances. Basically, he ended up coming out with some mild transphobic shit (and yes he did say he couldn't be transphobic because he's gay lol) and i figured the best way to try to get him to understand what he was saying was to make it personal and come out to him as trans. Well, long story short that was almost a year ago, i started socially and medically transitioning and I've seen him a couple of times since then when i was in my early-early days but not at all in the past 6 months. I contacted him a month or so ago seeing how he's doing and if he wants to meet up for a drink or something, which on the surface he appears receptive but when it gets to the point of actually arranging something he goes silent and stops responding. Then after a bit i contact him again to try to arrange something and the dance starts over with the same result. It makes me suspect he's uncomfortable with me now. He's not the kind of person to burn bridges in a bigotry-fuelled rant as that would too easily shatter the image he has of himself as being more progressive than he actually is and it does sound like him to quietly avoid someone who makes him uncomfortable although that's just speculation on my part.

Im not really too fussed if he no longer wants anything to do with me as socially my life's pretty good and everyone else has stuck by me, it just bothers me a bit that i don't exactly have an explicit answer. 

After typing that i think it is probably the case. I think im going to give up on him."

As expected, my mom's reaction was polite but total denial that transgender is a real thing, I was a guy, handsome, normal active male that loved to do male things growing up, etc.  Fortunately, I confirmed important details of incidents during my youth before bringing this out as she denied anything out of the ordinary for a male kid.  She brought up that she was a career biologist and knows enough about psychological issues that it was normal that I was exploring my feminine side.  I brought up the fact that many people like her thought I was gay, but gender is completely separate.  I was effectively talking with someone that firmly held onto their traditional values.

TrashcanThoughts,asktransgender,I need reassurance of my identity...,"Hey guys. The past few days have been a tad bit rough, and I've been questioning more than usual. I know I'm the only one who can really answer my own questions, but nonetheless:

I'm mostly questioning myself because I don't often feel ""dysphoria."" Often I don't mind how I look as a man – sometimes I even think I look pretty good – and I don't always mind being seen as a male. All my gender-related thoughts and feelings come from being envious of other women and their bodies, and picturing myself as a woman in all aspects of life.

See, a friend of mine who's a trans woman (and the same age as me) started to realize she was trans a few years ago, then started transitioning a few months ago. I, on the other hand, started to realize I was trans a few months ago and may start transitioning very soon. Knowing that, along with reading all the stories on Reddit, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not just rushing things.

I think about this stuff every day. But I'm having a hard time validating myself, because I'm not necessarily *unhappy* with what I am now, I just desire something else.

...Which seems to be a female body, at the least."

I've been questioning / doing a little experimenting and in a dream world where I win and lottery and never have to worry about money I think I would transition in a heartbeat but alas I didn't.

I have been considering making an appointment with Gendercare but when I seriously think about it I just say ""what's the point?"" I doubt I will start HRT since I am fearful of regret, even at 2-3 months HRT the breast tissue growth isn't reversible.

Is it even worth making an appointing to talk about it with someone to get it off my chest? Any other therapists? At the end of the day they're not going to go ""oh you're trans, you should start HRT"".

I also have dysphoria about my height, I am 6ft which isn't the end of the world... I have small hands and very small feet for my height and my build is very slim which is a plus I guess (went though a phase of trying to be overly masculine and realised my body bone structure sucked for a male even after lifting weights and getting somewhat 'ripped').

Anyone ever been in my shoes?

tao-nui,asktransgender,It doesn't go away.,"Hi there,

To those in a phase where dysphoria is hiding. You might feel like you are going to regret, or that you can survive that way. Maybe you found a partner and a stable environment that diminished your dysphoria.

But hear me out: It doesn't go away. Don't be fooled by the weeks, months, or maybe years going by, where denying is affordable. That thing comes in waves, and I come from an island, trust me:

**The longer the time between two waves, the bigger the next one will be**. if the water seem to retract from the beach you better buckle up and hold onto your butts because it's going to hit hard.

I just come back from two months where I was too busy to think, my work overwhelmed me. I have someone that understands me an with whom I can talk to so it helped a lot. For a time I felt weird because the feelings were diminished and I started to think ""I wasn't legit"" again. But for (I guess) no apparent reason it showed up again. It's funny because this time I was almost reassured that I wasn't crazy.

So, don't deny who you are. don't lose ten or twenty years to be who you want to be. Life is short, and it can be beautiful if you stop trying to be who people expect from you to be, and start trying to be who you expect from yourself.

pdx2las,asktransgender,Does Exercise Slow Down Breast Growth?,"Hi everybody,

This is my first time posting on here. I've been on hormones/laser coming up on three months now, and generally since I started my nipples have been somewhat sensitive and sore (sometimes a lot, sometimes just general sensitivity).

Probably several weeks ago I really started going to the gym to lose a little weight. Mostly a lot of cardio and leg workouts. I was about 175, now hovering around 165, and hopefully want to get down in the 150's. I had my T levels checked a few weeks ago, and it showed up at 20 ng/dL. So that's pretty good.

Anyways, to my issue, it seems on days that I consistently hit the gym, my nipples don't get sore and my ""breasts"" are smaller, but on rest days or days that I'm just lazy, they're noticably bigger and my nipples are far more sensitive.

Is this something I should worry about? I don't want to slow down my growth in any way. Thanks for your input!"

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,"Wrong body, wrong place.","I am 16 and live in germany. I just feel almost as bad as in that time I tried to kill myself. I have messed up and got messed up in the past too many times.

Starting with my past when I was young, I was expected to be really masculine. My parents just bought me football stuff, toy cars, I didn't even ask for it but they did it anyway. As they told me I had to be strong and I had to like girls, my will to tell them what I want left quite a bit. Then my father bought me girl stuff (girl shampoo, pink stuff etc.) even though it was by accident, he came home with it and my mother just ripped it out of my hand and said ""You don't want that do you? It's girl stuff, my will started to leave me again. Then there was a girl that came for my haircut to my home, I cried, screamed fought but still ended up in the chair getting a buzzcut, that's where my will left me. I thought that I had to be really masculine because that's what my parents wanted...

Continuing with start of puberty, I came in puberty. And this was horrible, as now my body starts to get masculine too not just my lifestyle. I survived a suicide attempt, I just got unconscious and did bleed a bit even though I jumped off the crown of a big tree, landing on  the back of my head (ca. 15m).

And then there is the current situation, living in germany where trans is treated the most bullshit way but in a way where it looks like you are getting treated fairly but you actually don't and the surgeons and overall doctors here can't do shit or don't want to do shit. My parents block everything and I now I am alone with no money, no friends, the doctors are treating me like shit, a body (no ffs here) and voice (no yeson fvs here) that disgusts me more than anything in the world. And on top all of that, my education is about to go down, I just can't concentrate on any tasks no matter if school or anything.

With all of that, I just keep getting more suicidal and really start to plan it. Nobody would care if I die so why not?"
wookiefax,asktransgender,What attributes signify male or female?,"Hi,

I was having a talk with someone on r/socialjustice101 and they advised I ask you guys to clarify something for me.

We were talking about what makes someone male or female, I was arguing that there are fundamental differences between the brains of those who identify as male or female, that it isn't a choice.

So here's my reasoning based on attributes that may or may not bring someone to identify one way or the other.

So for example, things that make someone male....

Genitalia - It's not necessary to have full male genitalia to be a male, genitalia are a good signal but not necessary, they're irrelevant.

Sexual Preference - This is completely irrelevant.

Other Physical Characteristics - More muscles, facial hair, etc...again these are a good indicator but not having these traits does not stop anyone from being a man.

Gender Preferences - So, this is where I'm a bit lost.

Some gender preferences seem to be innate others are learned from society.I was arguing that it's the innate preferences that make us male or female. Everything else I've listed above is not necessary to be a man.

Learned gender preferences are irrelevant too, I hate football, I'm still a man.

I guess what I'm asking is what is the essense of the different genders?If someone believes themselves to be the opposite sex what is it that drives this belief?

Even the innate preferences...being more nurturing or aggressive, having a preference for one toy over another or one activity over another.....none of those seem like they are necessary either.

I've eliminated all the attributes people seem to consider the makers of gender, is there something I'm missing?

As far as I can tell, it's the sum of all these parts and how someone's brain processes all of it together. That is still not something we have a choice over though is it?

Sorry for rambling, thoughts appreciated....

AndreaStewart,asktransgender,Hateful transphobic rant about me sent to my father,"I thought everything went well when I came out to my family. Turns out that's not the case. My stepfather (it's hard to call him that now) who, along with my mother, ended up being my legal guardian and seemed relatively normal when I was young, proved that arseholes exist even if they don't make themselves immediately visible. 
My stepfather recently sent my father an apparently horrible set of emails about my being trans. Why? Who knows. I guess he just hates trans people. Dad didn't actually send me the emails, protecting me from them, but did say that he'd been deeply offended and hurt by them. So, my question is whether I should read these abusive emails or not. I'm divided on this issue, weighing the pros and cons, and wonder if anyone might like to offer some advice."
AlliePiper,asktransgender,"HRT ""tolerance""?","I started HRT about 3 months ago, on a very low dose -- 1 mg estradiol and 50 mg spiro per day. For the first week or two, it was great -- my mind was calmer, I felt more at peace, my libido stopped being compulsive, and emotional connections were meaningful in ways they'd never been before. 

But after that initial couple of weeks, most of those effects started to go away. My libido returned and the calm, peaceful feelings left, which was terribly frustrating after getting a taste of how things were supposed to be.

Yesterday I saw my doctor and basically doubled my dosages, and after just two rounds of the higher doses I already feel the same relief that I felt when first starting HRT.

I'm attributing the loss of therapeutic effects to the very low dose I was taking initially, but it still makes me a bit nervous that this is all going to disappear again in a week or so, as if perhaps my body is just going to produce more testosterone to cancel out the HRT.

It sounds dumb now that I'm typing it out, but can anyone relate? While you were searching for an effective dose, did you notice the benefits disappear after the initial adjustment period? Did you eventually find a dose where the relief lasted?"

alexx_k,asktransgender,I have some questions.,"First things first, I'm really annoyed atm. I just spent about an hour writing this out, then accidentally pressed back when I put my phone down to play titanfall 2 (great game BTW, if you're in to shooters and giant robots it's certainly worth the money) 

Anyway, moving on. 
I'm 13, AMAB, MtF but pre anything. I know for definite what transitioning will do to me physically, mentally, etc. 
But I have some concerns.
So I'm 5 feet 9 inches tall, and my shoulders are roughly 17 inches across. Shoe size 10. What will change on HRT, what won't, etc? 

Second, what can I do about school? 
I haven't come out to a single person at school.
Some students at my school are fine, however the vast majority are just awful. They'll constantly say 'the t word', say anti gay stuff, things like that as insults. I had a plan to be on HRT for a while until I could pass, then move school and be stealth. Obviously, that's extremely simplified, but you probably get the idea. It's not going to work and I know it.
I used to be, by teachers and students, quite often be mistaken as a female. I had to pretend not to like it, as I have a kind of character I play when I'm around friends and/or at school. It's to stop myself from thinking about myself, just playing a character instead.
Focusing more on people thinking I'm female, it saddens me that it's pretty much stopped. My face pretty much hasn't changed for years, and facially I do look quite feminine before any effort to transition. 
I'm also not sure if it's because of my height and shoulder width, as there's a few girls in my grade who are tall and decently broad-shouldered. 
So the only thing I feel I can attribute it to is my voice which, I won't deny, is quite deep and masculine. I also do have a cold quite a lot of the time, which doesn't help. My voice stops me from imagining myself as a female in the future, post transition, even though I know that it's going to change with voice therapy and, if I can find a good doctor and get the money, surgery. But it still bugs me.
I don't know what to do about that feeling. 

Next, I want to talk about what my family, more specifically my parents. 
I told them around November-ish, but they seem to be ignoring it ever happened recently. In December my mother asked about it, but I was reluctant to discuss anything of it, since it makes me feel very awkward to talk about it face to face. Since then, there's been no mention of it by either parent since then. I told them I'd talk about it soon back then, but months has passed and... Nothing. What should I say, if anything? 
Yesterday my mum told me that ""I'm the perfect size to grow in to a man"". From her tone of voice, it sounded like there was no malicious intent. But it hurt. A lot. Both what she said, and how she said it- like she's pretending I'm not... How I am.
The rest of my family aren't accepting of trans people at all. My cousin is MtF, and they still deadname her, call her him etc. I can't imagine how awful that feels. I'm happy that I've lost contact with the members of my family who are that awful.

Okay, so I think I'm done with that. At least it's not as long as the first time I wrote it. It was at least 3x as long. I'll update if anything comes to mind. 
And to anyone who actually read all that, thank you. "

Goodbye for now New Look... you have been so kind to me but there are other waters to explore now. I may be back!

How commonly does this actually happen? I'd heard whispers but didn't really believe it."
Snobalt,asktransgender,Would transitioning do more harm than good?,"Hi guys.

So I've officially figured out that I am transgender. I was born male and have been dealing with bouts of gender dysphoria ever since high school (sophomore in university now; 19 years old). However, because I never fully understood transgenderism until recently, I consequently brushed off thoughts about transitioning until now. Thanks to an accelerated process from Fenway Health (a great trans medical center in Boston), I'm on track to get all my physical tests done next Friday the 17th and receive a prescription for hormones shortly after.

However, after talking it over with my dad, I am having second thoughts. My dad's a very open-minded guy and still loves and respects me no matter who I am. However, he's worried that it will do more harm than good in terms of relationships (friends/family) and job opportunities (both finding a job and sustaining one). While my dad and grandparents are very accepting, the remainder of my family (mom, aunts and uncles, cousins), whom I see quite often, are almost entirely socially conservative, which obviously presents a problem if I am to begin transitioning. Secondly, I've heard countless stories about transgenders being harassed and discriminated against in the workplace, and thus I fear I'll be making it very hard for myself when I enter the workforce. Also, I kinda already have a job lined up. I had an internship with a construction management company last summer, and they loved me so much that they will continue to let me do internships with them whenever I want; in fact, if all goes according to plan, I'll get my first real job with them after I finish university. I have a great opportunity lined up and I don't want to blow it.

I also deal with Asperger's and ADD; while I take meds for the ADD, Asperger's is just something that I need to be aware of and deal with. I feel that if transitioning would indeed do more harm than good, then my gender dysphoria will just be something I need to keep in mind and just try to manage. Continuing to be called male pronouns and everything wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but I still don't know if it's something I should just deal with.

So, question: Would transitioning have a negative effect on my relationships and employment outlook? Why or why not?"

towmotor,asktransgender,MTF dieting and exercise?,"So I am aiming to start HRT later this year (29 years old), and I want to put as much effort into this as I can. I have read that at my age, diet and exercising properly are extremely beneficial (if not outright required) for a successful transition. 

I am 5'11"" (not sure what that is in metric space numbers) and about 185 lbs on average (work boots, etc). I work as an industrial mechanic and though I am definitely NOT ripped I have to use my upper body strength on a semi-regular (every two weeks or so) basis. 

Currently my diet consists of mainly vegetarian food with occasional chicken, etc. I just had blood work done for an unrelated issue, my LDL is under 100 and my HDL is around 45. Normal blood pressure is 105 over... something, I can't remember. 

I was in the Air Force for six years (got out in 2013) and I have not worked out in several months. When I did exercise, it was low-intensity running, probably 6 miles a week.

Any advice on how to approach and structure this would be appreciated!"
MyUserNameIsRelevent,asktransgender,I have a lot of questions about MtF transitioning. Can you guys answer them? Thanks.,"Hey everyone, I'm a 19 year old guy, and I thiiiiiiink I wanna take the dive into HRT.  
I have a lot of concerns though, naturally. Hoping you can help me.  
1.) I see a lot of really beautiful trans folk online, but I'm worried that it might be a case of cherry picking. I'm worried that I won't be able to pass as a woman. I'm skinny, but I'm 6 foot 3 and have a crazy deep voice. Can I expect to pass anyway?  
2.) My family is pretty conservative and I'm pretty fuckin' scared to say anything about it. To give you an idea, I've cried up in my room before after hearing my dad, yet again, call a trans person 'gross.' Is there any way I could begin to transition to get a feel for it without anyone in my family knowing? They still pay for my insurance, I imagine that's an issue?  
3.) Could I quit if I'm not liking the changes? A friend told me they'd start me off on pills and that I would feel changes pretty quickly. They then said that if I didn't like what I was going through that I could stop without anything too crazy happening. Is this accurate or is it a 100% commitment?  
4.) Should I make this decision now? Should I wait a bit longer? As of now, I can usually go a day or two at most without it popping back up in my head. I try not to think about it because I get upset. In fact the only reason I'm posting this tonight is because I saw a very beautiful trans woman and got a bit choked up, heh. Upset that I probably couldn't ever look that amazing.  
If you've made it this far, thank you for reading my questions. Even if you don't answer, I appreciate you taking the time.  
Thank you, guys. I hope to hear back."
alex_the_bolshevik,asktransgender,Do you think cis people would be more sympathetic to a cis character with dysphoria and learn to support trans people better?,"I want to have a girl who comes to the US from Russia.  She wants to wear pink and dresses all the time and acts it was a crime to get the wrong toys.  The school is very unsupportive and they put her in special ed and tell her that she can't wear pink or do any of the things she wants because they say that it enforces the patriarchy.  It goes through a lot of the same things as if she were trans where other people don't want to allow her to be a girl. Would this make more of a point about gender identity for cis people. "
isleepinahammock,asktransgender,Stepping Down as Mod,"Hi everyone,
Just a quick note. I've stepped down as a mod on r/asktransgender. 

First, I'm fine. This is nothing dark or grim. Life just has taken me in a certain direction, and I don't have as much time to devote to the trans subreddits as I once did. You'll occasionally see me around, but I'm not active enough to feel that I can justify a mod seat. 

Again, just didn't want anyone to get worried. I'm perfectly fine. Life's going well. My teaching and other related duties have put an increasing demand on my time, and I don't have the time any longer to devote to modding (and I haven't been the most active mod.) 

Just want to say, thank you all. It's been a privilege to help this community out however I can. This isn't goodbye, as I'll still be around occasionally. However, I'll be just a normal commenter from here on forth.

Thanks,  
Love you all,

genderboxes,asktransgender,Has anyone updated their name with social security while a tax refund is being processed?,"Friday I'm completing the final step of the court order for my name/gender marker change. I want to change it with social security as soon as I can because of job hunting reasons (my state Oregon technically protects trans folks from employment discrimination, but that hasn't stopped at least one recruiter from dropping me once they found out I was in the process of an obviously trans name change, and another recruiter insisting I had to present as deadname to the client). 

I can wait for my federal one to process, because that should only be a few weeks or less, but my state one is going to take like another 3 months because of a manual review (not an audit). And I mean, my SSN will be the same, which is presumably more important for the refund and the IRS generally. I just don't want to make the process of getting my tax stuff taken care of any more painful than necessary.


Did anyone change their name in this kind of a situation? I'm thinking about calling the IRS to ask, but I'm not crazy about being on hold for probably several hours.

EDIT - poking around on the Oregon Dept of Revenue site FAQs came up with this: ""Refunds may take longer if there are changes to your name or Social Security number, or your return requires manual review."" I guess it's already under manual review that'll take 12 weeks, so I'll just wait until after the federal one and then do the name change."

My_partneristrans,asktransgender,Questioning trans to cross dress to questioning again. Added bonus of biological clock ticking,"My partner and I are both in our 30s, together for little over 12 yrs.

Last year he (my partner hasn't told me which pronouns to use so I'm going with male ones until told otherwise) told me that he thinks he may be trans. He's involved in the trans subs, looks at feminine clothing, and went out dressed as a woman once. 

He told me that maybe he wasn't trans and just liked cross dressing since HRT seemed a lot of work. To be honest I was relieved since I know I won't be attracted to him if he transitioned. I've known plenty of MtFs and FtMs in my life, I just don't find them sexually attractive. 

So for months I lived thinking they were cross dressing and put the trans issue behind me, until tonight. He's brought it up again since we're discussing children, as people in our mid 30s the clock is sort of ticking. He didn't outright say he was trans, but brought up that I said I didn't want kids if he was transitioning (I don't).

I wish he made up his mind. I don't want kids cause HRT takes time and while he says he won't change personally--he thinks everything will be as it always has, I've known people pre and post hrt and they're day and night. Some for the better and some for the worse. 

I don't want to bring a kid into a situation that isn't stable and if we wait any longer, I'll be to old to have kids. I personally don't want them any later than 35, which is next year.

I'm also scared that post transitioning he won't be the person I've loved all these years."

xxnoxynoxxnoxy,asktransgender,Pre-transition MTF at a crossroads and could use some advice.,"I told my wife when we got together 15 years ago right off the bat that I was trans. I've always kept in mind how cool she was about it. At the same time, I've always said I'd never transition because I didn't think I'd pass, so I think she never seriously considered having to face me transitioning. I recently changed my mind and was basically ready to start HRT, like now. We have a 15-month-old and we're at the point where we're ready to make a decision about a second child. I nudged subtly, sensitively, that this is where I was, hoping to get some kind of enthusiasm but instead she sort of repeatedly dodged, indicating to me that she was not into the idea. I brought it up explicitly and we had a long conversation about it in which she indicated more or less while she was pretty open to alternative lifestyles in her youth, at this point she knows she's straight and isn't into the idea, would prefer that I didn't do it. She said she would see not ever having a sexual relationship with a man again in her life as a loss.  

That pretty much made up my mind, there's no way I'd want to take something away from her like that, but I've been so depressed ever since. Wondering how any of you may have dealt with this situation I guess, or any constructive thoughts you might have for me. I probably don't need to tell you what a huge part of my life my gender issue is. I feel like this might be my last chance to really live the life I was meant to, to really be happy. At the same time, I don't know if I would be sacrificing a happy family life. :/

On top of all this of course there are the social pressures I'd have to contend with, raising a son in an alternative household with no 'father'. Sigh. 

**TLDR;** Pre-everything MTF ready to transition, turns out wife of 10 years who's known all along I'm trans isn't attracted to women at all, not sure if I'd be sacrificing a happy life for an uncertain future, not sure if I'd be cheating myself out of finally living as a whole person not sure if there's some third option I'm not considering short of living as long as possible holding out until humanity develops age-reversing drugs and I can try again.

justanothertransgril,asktransgender,"Thinking about going stealth when I get to 8 months in, is this even possible?","Hey, I'm not sure where exactly to ask this but I hope this is right.  When I came out last month I had to drop out of college because my grandparents didn't want me to get ""corrupted"" anymore.  Needless to say since then it's just been ""it"", ""you're ruining your life"", ""you don't actually wear that do you?  You're a joke"" and other nonsense on a daily basis that I have to put up with since I don't really have anywhere else to go.  Fortunately I managed to convince them to let me go back to college next fall.  Now here's the problem, I've been on E since January 9th (so about 45 days at the time of this post) and my goal is to without my family's knowledge sign back up for college as a girl.  And since I live in NC I really don't want to risk any of my teachers or peers thinking I'm trans, so ideally I would stealth.

I'm not sure if I can do this however, since I need to get a job, electrolysis, voice work, and figure out makeup and fashion from scratch among other things.  Not to mention that if the hormones don't work fast enough all my efforts will be for nothing anyways.  I currently look on the more masculine side of [femboy](http://i.imgur.com/5dP1NJm.jpg) for reference, with the only real development so far being some breast buds just noticeable enough to make me wear hoodies all the time.  Maybe this much progress in such a short time is impossible but I want to try anyways.  If anyone else has done something like this, any tips or help would be appreciated."
hurtingincloset,asktransgender,"older, in the closet, depressed and sad right now","I'm using this space to mostly write so I don't blow my brains out I have a hand gun upstairs that I think about from time to time. You see I'm 49 years old, Married, have kids, I'm a senior manager at a firm and make great $$. My wife doesn't work and I married her because I love her. I fell in love with her. 

I came out to my wife 2 years ago telling her I was transgender and she at first was good with it, for about 16 hours, then freaked out on me. we then went to multiple counselors which didn't work. the first counselor wanted me to get tested for testosterone saying I was to low in it and that was my problem, the second one my wife hated because they ""picked my side"", the third one wanted me to take a test for bi-polar *sigh*. I'm not bi-polar, I'm not low on T.  So then my wife said she didn't think she could do it and wanted a divorce. So we went back and forth with me in denial, or denouncing my identity, and her in crisis that her ""life is over"" because of me. And we have been doing this ever since. 

so why don't I just walk out?   well I could, I could say F it... and divorce. I don't want a divorce I love my partner, well most of her and she loves me.  Yet I am troubled.  I thought she was perfect and would accept me no matter what. 

You know the test.... ""If I were burned and could not even have sex, would you still love me and stay with me?"" and her answer would be ""YES..of course"".  But if I say ""If I were to come out as transgender would you stay with me and love me?"" and her answer is ""No""  

I don't get it. It is super disappointing and saddening and depressing. I can tell you my wife loves me, but she doesn't love me if my gender is female. 

AND Today I am double depressed because the monster in the office TRUMP and his cronies now control the country because the liberal vote was split, or people just didn't vote because they weren't *excited* enough. Why do I care, I make lots of $$. well I care because I'm a person and I believe everyone has rights and our leadership should be one of uniting us, not dividing us. 

Trump...is a monster, and his staff is the %1 club.

Ok back on topic. So... I'm depressed today, I'm in the closet because I love my wife and my kids. I want to transition but I won't. I don't see any choice in the matter, I can't have my cake and eat it too, I love my wife and kids, I love my job and the $$. I hate myself, but I have lived with myself for 50 years, so I'm used to it. 

so I change the channel if ""lola"" the song is on, which I love that song. and I avoid ""Transparent"" and ""the danish girl"" and all those shows BUT.. I listen to the songs in private, I watch the shows in private I do girl things in private and finally...I DAM sure browse and post in total anonymous mode (well pretty anonymous mode anyway).

I'm out there, I will fight for LGBT people, I will fight Trump and his cronies, and I will stay with my family whom I love.

Thanks for listening and sorry if this is mostly a ramble. "
NotPranking,asktransgender,Told my closest friends how i feel about myself,"So recently i have had somewhat of a falling out with my girlfriend. I had told her basically everything about me including my plans to transition. It was super rad she was a sweetheart about it and helped me buy clothes and told me she totally supports me. Recently she told me that me wanting to transition is stressing her out and that i was the reason she has been so easily angry. While our relationship is hanging by a thread I had been venting to my two closest friends and i was as vague as i could be. I got to the point where i felt like i was being annoying and i told one friend the whole story including me wanting to transition. It went so well i couldnt ask for a better response. After she soaked it in she told me i have her support and she doesn't care what i want to do she will still be my friend. 

Awesome!

The next person i told was her boyfriend whom is one of my long time friends i play games with every night. He was a little harder to tell since he is a psychology major. Not that his major really means much. He kept asking me things like ""so why would having a vagina make you happy?"" and he tried telling me that my conflict with my girlfriend is the reason i feel this way. I told him after he said that, i felt this way since kindergarten. Because of some of the things he said im keeping this part somewhat short. He went from the vagina comment to ""you do you dude"". Our conversation turned into a talk about therapists and his insight on seeking help.

Overall i feel this was a positive experience. Ive known both of them for seven years so I guess im not totally going to lose everyone i know and love.
tldr: falling out with girlfriend made me seek support from friends. Went better than expected."
SingularityWins,asktransgender,Strategies for inexpensive sex reassignment surgeries (SRS),"Hi everyone,

We're looking for options and strategies for US residents who want to undergo sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) with the least expense. We've collected a few ideas already, but I'd love to hear from the community about options you may have taken or considered. For persons who have already undergone SRS, we welcome your anecdotes about cost and efficacy.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a list of strategies we've considered:

#1. Move to a state which has health care coverage of SRS procedures. Purchase appropriate individual health insurance. Costs: ~$5k.

For finding a state that ensures healthcare coverage of SRS, [this spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4uph9qyk602pc22/Law%20and%20Policies%20by%20state.ods?dl=0) is a good starting point. CA, CO, CN, DC, IL, MA, NY, OR, VT, WA all appear to be viable options.

Moving can allow you to qualify you for a [Special Enrollment Period (SEP)](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/) to change your health insurance plan. It appears that this switchover is relatively easy: you move, you get new healthcare coverage, you move forward with your procedures.

* The total procedure cost of this option will be the cost of the health insurance plus your out-of-pocket maximum for your policy. If you do everything in 1 year, with a health plan that has a $5000 out-of-pocket maximum, your total cost would be **~$5000**.
* The cost above does not including the monthly costs of the health care plan itself. If you are paying $500/mo for your policy, including it brings the total cost up to ~$11000 (but note that you're getting significantly more value from your health insurance than just SRS coverage).
* The cost above does not include the cost to move, which could be another few thousand USD (and doubled if you plan to move back again afterwards) depending on your situation. This option assumes you make a more permanent move. For a short-term move, see #1b below.
* The cost above assumes you already qualify for SRS (so e.g., you have already been on hormones for some time prior to your procedures).


&amp;nbsp;


#1b. ""Medical tourism"" within the USA. As #1 above, but your move is temporary. Costs: ~$7k to ~$9k best-case, $15k+ for worst-case.

Due to the availability of the SEP and free travel laws in the USA, it appears one could do ""state-to-state"" medical tourism within the USA. Your plan: briefly move to a new state, have your procedures, then move back.

The incremental costs of a round-trip move will depend on your situation.

*In the best-case scenario:*

* You pay rent only in the new location. For example, you end your current lease and get a short-term lease at your new location.
* You stay at the new location for very few months; let's say 2 months.
* You don't have to worry about maintanence at your current location; all your costs are in your new location.
* You don't move your household goods (and instead, someone keeps them for you, or you put them in storage, etc.)
* Rent and cost-of-living at the new location are the same or lower than your current location.

In this scenario, your incremental costs are probably **~$2k to ~$4k** for breaking leases, non-refundable deposits, travel costs, etc.
	
&amp;nbsp;
	
*In the worst-case scenario:*

* You pay rent twice: once for your old apartment, and again for the new apartment at your new location. Let's say +$800/mo.
* You stay at the new location for many months; let's say 6 months.
* You have to pay someone to maintain or check on your old apartment / house. Let's say $100/mo.
* You have to move your household goods, and then move them again when you return. Let's say you do it on the cheap for $1500*2 = $3k.
* Rent and cost-of-living at the new location are substantially higher than your current location. Let's say +$500/mo.

In this scenario, your incremental costs are probably **$10k or more**.

In any event, you're still paying the other costs associated with #1 above (e.g. $5k out-of-pocket max, etc.).


&amp;nbsp;


#2. Move to a state in which an employer-sponsored healthcare policy covers SRS procedures. Get a job with appropriate health insurance. Keep the job through your procedures. Procedure costs: ~$5k.

Note that this option is even available for states that have few civil rights protections, e.g. insurance from Blue Cross Blue Shield in North Carolina. However, if the state does not have anti-discrimination laws protecting you, you could be fired and lose your coverage. This is very risky. Picking a state that has nondiscrimination laws (e.g. New Mexico) may mitigate the risk, but you'll still need to find a policy that actually covers your procedure. Moreover, since you may be transitioning visibly at work, you are at higher risk for workplace discrimination irrespective of laws.

* The total procedure cost of this option will be the portion of the cost you bear for your employer-provided health insurance plus your out-of-pocket maximum for your policy. If you do everything in 1 year, with a health plan that has a $5000 out-of-pocket maximum, your total cost would be ~$5000.
* The cost above does not including the monthly costs of the health care plan itself. If you are contributing $250/mo towards your workplace policy, including it brings the total cost up to ~$8000 over 1 year (but note that you're getting significantly more value from your health insurance than just SRS coverage).
* The cost above does not include the cost to move, which could be another few thousand USD depending on your situation.
* The cost above assumes you already qualify for SRS (so, e.g., you have already been on hormones for some time prior to your procedures). 

Technically you could also take this option as a ""medical tourism"" option as well, planning on keeping your job only until you are done transitioning, after which you resign and return to your prior state. This may be messy, but it seems theoretically possible. Be sure to pick an ""at-will"" employment state and do not commit to any term-duration employment contracts.




&amp;nbsp;



#3. Medical tourism outside the USA. Travel to another country and pay for procedures out-of-pocket. Procedure costs: depends on your situation, but between $4k and $25k.


Medical tourism is a viable option if you cannot move to a different state, but still want to minimize your total out-of-pocket costs. Thailand and the Phillipines both seem to be good options to consider.

* The costs of this option vary enormously based on what you are trying to achieve. Top surgery alone will run you in the low thousands of USD. Bottom surgery is much more expensive, and FTM appears to be greatly more expensive than MTF. The highest-price scenarios we've sketched out are around $25k out-of-pocket (FTM).

* Your travel cost to these countries could add another few hundred USD, up to maybe ~$2k USD, depending on where you are located in the USA and whether or not you are flexible on when you can make the trip.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Other strategies we considered (e.g. as paying out-of-pocket in the USA without health coverage) seem strictly worse than the strategies above. We've certainly not thought of all possible strategies, though. 

What other strategies are there? Any corrections to the strategies above? Any cost calculators / resources / anecdotes to share? We'll edit this post with your new information. Thanks so much everyone."
RandomPerson55555,asktransgender,"[HRT Question][MtF] Missed half of my daily HRT, a little worried.","Hello!

First and foremost I want to say thanks to this sub. I posted 11 months ago at my lowest point and things have only gone up from there. Thank you. =)

I started HRT 1 Month and 5 days ago and went up to 4 mg E (2 pills) and 100 MG S (4 pills) daily 5 days ago. My hours of sleep are a little odd due to work and school but I have never missed anything until yesterday when I fell asleep before taking the other half.

I just started noticing and feeling the changes of HRT as well as starting the new amount. I am worried that it may have messed something up due to these two things just beginning. I am so angry at myself for it and I don't know what to do.

Should I just continue with the normal amounts? Will it have any negative effects/halt or stop progress? From the information I could find they said not to try and catch up.

I apologize if it sounds like I am panicking, I have just been so happy with everything the last little bit and I feel like I have messed it up. "
rubbish45,asktransgender,How do I get past suicide?,"This was a crazy weekend for me.  I woke up in the ER, heavily sedated in a large empty room by myself.  I couldn't really remember much of what had happened but I knew that I had tried to take my life in some capacity.  My partner was there with me, my family soon showed up and I was showered with love.

The thing is, I had never thought much about suicide unless I had been drinking or in some other way incapacitated.  Now, 48 hours sober I look at everything as an opportunity to kill my self.  Is this going to go away?  Do I need to go get checked into some facility?  

This is a throwaway because I don't want my other online friends to know about any of this.  I am really afraid of losing my job should my employers find out.  I guess I am lucky that I was able to convince them that I am. I longer a threat to myself.  Damn this feeling sucks, dysphoria sucks and having this god awful male body makes me feel worse and worse every minute.  Hormones need to work faster!!!!!   Is there any light at the end of this tunnel?  Christ it just seems so much more appealing to just permanent fall asleep so I don't have to deal with this shit.

IagoLemming,asktransgender,"I wrote my senator about a bathroom bill, and got a dismissive and condescending response back. What should I do about it?","**EDIT 2: Since people have asked, [Here is the full letter from Sen. Huffines.](http://imgur.com/S7PSYVY)**

*EDIT 3: The Dallas Voice has taken me up on my offer, they are going to be publishing an online article about the letter. I will be posting it across Reddit when it goes up. Thank you for the interest and the support!*

Full context, I live in Texas, and I wrote Sen. Don Huffines, who is both my Texas State Senator and the senator directly responsible for introducing the proposed Bathroom Bill to the Texas Legislature.

I wrote him to tell him that I was concerned this bill would make me the target of violence in public restrooms, and asked him how he would avoid this.

His answer didn't even acknowledge my concern, and just said that if businesses pull out of Texas over the bill that it'll hurt them, because Texas doesn't need them, and he's done so much to help businesses.

He claims that this bill only applies to government buildings, but also that what bathrooms transgender adults use is their ""personal choice."" 

Furthermore, he calls gender identity a social engineering experiment and says that children aren't ready to deal with it because they don't fully understand their ""God-given genders,"" whatever the hell that means.

I'm pretty upset right now. I actually would love the chance to send his letter to local newspapers and ask them to write a story about it. I'm not sure if any newspapers would agree to do it though, and if so I'm not sure how to reach out to them. Should I even bother?

Basically, I want to get this letter in front of every Trans person in the state of Texas, so they can see what Sen. Huffines thinks of us. Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation? How would you handle this?

SolitaryOrchid,asktransgender,My Marriage Problems are Making Me Suicidal and I Don't know What to Do About It,"Logically I know that if my relationship ends I'll probably find someone else, maybe someone even better for me who loves me as I am. Logically I know that one day I'll get over it and move on. Logically I know that it's not true that I'm unlovable. But logic isn't helping me.

I can't go a single day without thinking I'm unlovable and worthless. The person who matters most to me doesn't want me anymore. That hurts a lot. And my self worth has always been wrapped up in how he sees me. I don't know how to see myself as worth something when he doesn't love me or want me anymore. I don't know how to see myself as good enough.

I try to push the suicidal thoughts away but it just comes out in other ways. I joke about suicide and no one thinks twice but I'm serious when I say it. I don't tell anyone that though. Why have them worry for no reason? And would they even care anyway? I don't matter to anyone. My husband was all I had. I don't have friends and my family is basically gone. I have no one now. And I try to connect with others but I just can't seem to make any friends. Once my husband is gone I will be completely alone. And I don't know how to live a life alone. What do you do when you truly have no one? I don't have an answer to that.

I try to push the thoughts away and bury them, but they just come back. I'm a waste of space who is good for nothing. I can't hold a job, I miss class all the time because I'm just a complete mess and am so depressed all the time. I can't take care of myself or support myself. What's the point in even trying to make it on my own when I already know how much of a failure I am? Why not just end it? Isn't death preferable to a life of pain? I don't foresee a future for myself. There is only more pain. Is it really so wrong to want to quit early and miss all that pain?"
Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: Older_Wiser2 here w/question about gender marker changes and maybe name changes...,"Hi .... Okay - here's the deal - My doctor wants me to go forward with a gender marker change if nothing else. Of course going all in would require a name change as well as my current name is masculine. 

Because of a number of issues including my wife, who is staying with me at the moment but does not want me to change my gender marker and the fact I have travel soon to a Middle Eastern country (Jordan). I've been there MANY times. One issue that's come up for me and travel is I now look far more female than male unless I ""man up"" which I'm very opposed to, I have a big chest now, and unless I try to make something appear below it's hard to do (no pun intended) ... I've had an orchi - the rest has shrunk significantly, and when I wear tight panties nothing even begins to show - no tucking needed. 

So my question is - should I change my passport to match what I appear and what will show on a scanner or keep it as is with me listed as ""male"" .... keep in mind I'll never get a name change through in time for it to reflect on a passport (I'll be traveling most likely within 30 days). The passport part is easy with my letter - the rest is a challenge ...

Any advice from anyone who's been in similar circumstances?   ~Joelle"

What if I give up everything only to have negative results and still not be happy with who I am.

voicethrowaway1337,asktransgender,Is anyone taking Minivelle patches for their estrogen? My levels are a bit weird. My E levels went down very low when my patch dose was doubled.,"Here's roughly how my timeline went with my bloodtests:

Dose 1: .05 mg/day patch 50 mg of spiro

- Bloodtest for dose 1: 56 pg/mL Estrogen and much higher than desired ng/dL T 

Dose 2: .05 mg/day patch 100 mg spiro

- Bloodtest for dose 2"" 46 pg/mL estrogen and 100 ng/dL testosterone

For the first two doses, I noticed the changes kinda stagnated. I male failed a few times/

Dose 3: .1 mg/day patch 200 mg spiro (100mg twice a day)

- Bloodtest for dose 3: **18 pg/mL estrogen 57 ng/dL testosterone

My prescribing doctor told me to get another bloodtest two weeks later since it might have been a fluke.

- Repeat blood test for dose 3: 26.9 pg/mL estrogen 57 ng/dL testosterone

I'm just very confused on why my levels went down a LOT during dose 3, but I have a few ideas why, but before that, I want to say that I had a lot of changes as a result of getting on dose 3. My face changed quite a bit and I had a lot more breast growth than I had on dose 1 and 2, where there were changes but they kinda stagnated after a month. At worst, for dose 3, I started seeing not as many changes maybe a few weeks before the bloodtest. I'm still able to produce sperm from the looks of things as well though, but I'm not sure when the testes start to lose functionality and how fast HRT takes it away for most people.

The only factor that I can think of that might have affected my estrogen levels is patch placement. After dose 3, I started to place patches  on my butt since my lower abdomen was pretty messed up from the patches, so I wanted to give it a lot of time to recover. Minivelle's manual and website says that it can be applied to the ""lower abdomen or buttocks"" so I'm not exactly sure if putting the patches on the butt cheeks would have affect things at all. I also gained about 10 lbs (120 lbs to 130) and a lot went to the booty while on dose 3's butt patches so I'm thinking it might be related, but I'm not sure. I'm the first trans patient for my prescribing doctor that's been on the patch too.

I still have about 50+ .1 mg/day patches left, and the doctor is mailing a prescription for 2 mg twice a day sublingual estrogen patches. When I had a 2nd opinion from an endocrinologist and two other general practitioners on patch vs other methods, apparently the .5 mg patch has an equivalent dose to this set of 2 mg twice a day sublingual pills if I remember correctly. I'll ask them all again when I get a chance.

I've been on HRT since march. Doses 1-2 were from March to September and Dose 3 was from September to December."

But ever since I discovered my transness, it was like I ate the forbidden fruit at the tree of knowledge. Everything started to make sense; they now had an explanation. It wasn't because I was traumatized as a child or having some weird fetish by envying pretty girls and having this subtle, indiscernible, yet powerful urge to want to ""be"" like them. Those moments I thought of myself crossdressing - and actually doing it, the times I suppressed my actual feelings to conform to society's (or my own) ideal of manliness, my general awkwardness socially, those subtle cues (interests, behaviour, mannerisms) that when I reflected were my true self revealing itself, it made me feel liberated.

I'm currently on vacation with my family for the weekend and despite all the fun that I should be having right now I *can't stop fucking thinking about being trans*. Is there any way to just calm down and not thing about it for a day or two?
eldritchterror,asktransgender,"Went to a new clinic, have some concerns","Recent I had to move for college, and i had t oset up a new appointment to continue my prescription and such, so I set that up at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. It took me 4 times to set up an appointment, the first 2 times they said they would transfer me then just hung up. The third time they said they wouldn't accept my insurance then hung up. The fourth time was just a simple ""oh yeah i can set that up for you no problem"", and I'd like to note that this was the exact same person answering the phone each time. 
That was a hassle but ok. Fastforward to the appoint i had on the 8th, i get told i cannot have an HRT appointment because the operator did not put me as that, despite me having made it very clear that that was what i was looking for. So now i have to sign about 30pgs extra paper work as well as speak with on an site psychiatrist and watch some whole video about it all despite them already knowing ive been on HRT for a year. I sign some psychiatric evaluation form and a form that basically equated started HRT and any form of gender dysphoria as a mental disorder. Cool, hat really set the tone for this visit. My doctor was a doctor that is brand new to this and is only ever allowed to do HRT visits when he has someone with him to make sure he doesnt cock it up, they let me have my appointment anyway but as a general practitioner visit. Me and the doctor talk, I tell him I've been on hormones for 2 weeks shy of a year, I know the drill, I'm just looking for a prescription refill for the next 4 months. Says he cant do it and I have to join their trans health program because I can start anything, and that I'd have to start from the very beginning and essentially said they were taking my hormones away. I told him to fuck off and I'm not doing that it's either this or I just get my current prescription filled another way because im not starting from scratch and im not gonna be demeaned like this and treated like a fuckin idiot. A little back and forth and he finally gives in to agreeing to give me a refill of everything for the next month and to do bloodwork to discuss it for a next official HRT visit. I agree and go do that, bloodwork takes 2 hrs of waiting before i have to go up to the desk and say I've been waiting for 2hrs and have a life to get back to whats going on (I've been here for a total of 6 hrs now) and they tell me to just keep waiting, another 30m and i just get up and go to the bloodwork lab and stand outside it until one of them takes me. Get that done, and when I get down to the pharmacy and turns out they only filled half my prescription. The doctor refused to give me my estradiol and wanted to cut my spiro doseage, but thank god they had their vitamin d in stock :T
Had to wait an 1 and a half hours for them to fill my prescription and get it ready after argueing with them about keeping my spiro dose the same because no one told me that was being changed and the doctor didn't talk to me about that at all, as well as getting my estradiol. I come back, they havent even started getting it ready yet and i have to wait another 40m before i get everything but the estradiol which i had to back and get 2 days later after telling them that my doctor explicitly told me i would be getting a refill for that this month and they had to wait for an ~*official email*~.

So that's all just the setup to the list of concerns I have, because this clinic doesn't sound very reliable after all of this despite it being their specialty. Currently I am on 175mg Spiro, 8mg estradiol, 100mg Progesterone, and 2000UI Vit D per day. I was originally on 200mg Spiro and i was asking to see if I could get it raised again to 200mg since my previous doctor lowered it for me since I had mentioned my libido was shot to hell. I can feel the emotional and somewhat physical difference of that doseage and its not pleasant so I was asking to put it back up. He says those are the highest doseages of spiro and estradiol he's ever seen, and that progesterone was a controversial medicine. I already knew that about progesterone, and I've heard my doseage is a little high, but they made it sound as if it were life threateningly high, and that I'm going to go into liver failure in 3 days.

I have a lot of concerns. 
* Is my prescription actually dangerously high? I've never been told this by anyone before and my previous physician started me on that dose
* What do I do if they force me into their program and to start my transition all over again?
* what happens if they lower my hormones to a much much lower level (he mentioned that 75mg spiro and 2mg estradiol per day was a starting dose)
* is this actually a reliable place, has anyone else gone here and had these problems? I feel like this is a lot of questionable behind the back and non-communicative stuff that isn't right for a clinic with something like this

i'm very worried about them basically taking away my hormones because the way literally everyone there talked was that they'd take it all away, more or less wait until it was flushed from my system, and start over on their doses, along with a lot of things I've seen of dehumanizing these issues and treating it like im a walking mental disorder.

Currently I am weighing the options. I am unsure if I have strong dysphoria or dysphoria at all but a lot is me not accepting how I feel and worry that it might just be depression. Sometimes I wish I had strong dysphoria (I know I would not want to actually) to prove to myself that I should transition.

On the other hand, every day is a face. A lie and a mask I show to everyone. A mask I am judged and based on and judged on white, male, straight until proven otherwise etc. None of this is me but something that I still get because I did not choose. This was assigned to me from birth because nature's slump decided to give me a male gender at birth. I still don't feel secure calling myself a girl but I have overcome the insecurity in calling myself trans.

Now I have a choice to make. Should I conform to the assigned role I have lived in since birth and that everyone sees me as? Should I just ""try to accept what I am"" even though I really can't seem to accept that I am a boy. I wonder if I should just give up and try ""to be the boy I was born as and everyone sees me as""? I don't know but it feels wrong to try and be something when I might be something else. However the works is expecting me to be a straight man even if it outright does not say it. I will remain as this white man to everyone untile I prove otherwise which is something I can't do with the body I am currently inhabiting. 

The other choice would be to just accept transitioning on the basis of an insecure and unsure wish I uses to have about being a girl. To do it on a hunch that imagining myself as a girl with a girl feels right. For a desire to express something I am unable to. To wear the things I want to be. To be able to maybe find myself good looking/sexy/cute and wear clothing to match. To be able to live without constant indirect pressure to be in a certain way. To avoid being bases around what others see and be something I see...

I don't know anymore.. Both alternatives have benefits but just remaining as I am and try to ""accept myself"" being the mask everyone view me as and don't have to deal with others shit.... I wish I did not have to make this choice... I know being trans is not a choice and that I can't be expected to just ""cope"" with my gender like cispeople but I keep asking myself: why can't I let this go? Why can't I just ""cope"" with my gender like ""everyone"" else? Why do I have to be like this? Etc...... 

Anyways any tips..? Personally I think transitioning is harder but maybe allow me to express myself instead of a mask..?

SoontobeSam,asktransgender,Getting fed up with my doctor,"there is a question here, but it's also a lot of rant I expect, sorry. 

I'd posted previously of some of the issue's I've had with my doctors since last May but a recap is that at 1 year HRT my prolactin was up, not dangerous levels but high, so they cut my injections in half and this led to rough mood swings and suicidal thoughts, 6 weeks later they take me off E entirely because prolactin didn't go down, even though I told them both times it was probably the Cyproterone Acetate since it was changed after my last blood test before this started. This also happens to be the week I went full time, so stress levels weren't exactly low. 2 1/2 months later my doctors tell me it's probably the cypro and put me back on E, at 2mg a day oral when my previous dose on injections was equivalent to 2-4 times that (10mg/ml 1ml weekly) and booked me out 4 1/2 months instead of a recheck after 6 weeks to make sure that the dose was doing something. that appointment was supposed to be Jan 30th, they canceled and re-booked for today, which they just canceled and re-booked for a month from now... 

so through all of this, I've been on either no E or too low a dose to have any significant effect for the last 8 months, I've stalled out completely on physical changes, I've lost all respect for my doctors and I'm getting more and more depressed over the state of this. I'd change doctors, but there aren't any others to go to... there are 2 endos in the city that treat trans patients, mine and another with a 6-8 month wait list.

What should I do? at this point I'm strongly debating just doubling what I take anyway without waiting on them, I'm tired of having no progress. "

Fuyudzuki,asktransgender,"hello, first time posting her and well reddit even. looking for helpful advice or opinions would anyone mind giving theirs?","I have been questioning my gender identity on a concuss level for about six years now. I am 22 turning 23 in a few months. I was assigned male at birth and have lived that way pretty much till now. I was born and raised 21 years in KC MO my parents still live there. I am currently attending college in Florida, and I started seeing one of the therapists at my college last fall after talking a few sessions I felt comfortable enough to decide that I wanted to transition once I’m out of college.  Which will be in about 2 or 2 and a half years. If you are curious why I’m waiting it’s because my family does not approve in the least, so I’m just going to be patient till I’m out of school, and have my own means of earning a living. Also, I lack transportation to get myself off campuses and to other places it’s a small small college I go to as well. I have however started shaving though only facial hair, body hair will be next semester so as not to do too much too fast and risk shocking my family to much. I have started growing my hair out though it’s less than an inch long still. I have started buying a few pieces of clothing mostly simple things I can wear when alone till I’m more confident. 

So here are my main questions starting off:

•	Any ideas or suggestions on how to continue forward? I mean in a general sense, I know just because it worked for someone else that it might not work for me. But hay asking and learning what others have done rarely hurts.

•	I’m currently trying to lose weight and slim down I’m presently 6’3” or 6’4” not sure exactly. Built pretty much like a brick and close to 80 pounds overweight any ideas for a good way to lose the extra weight and get a more feminine figure?

•	Then as my parents don’t approve of my inclinations. Any ideas for some small little things I can do to drop hints and slowly ease into some girly/feminine things around them, so it does not look like I went zero to sixty from their perspective?

•	And lastly any ideas on the way to make myself feel a bit more feminine in the mean time? Mostly things that you or people you know have tried that I can give a whirl. preferably things that are either 1 free or 2 cheap as I have no income at the moment.

I know this post is a little bit of a mess both grammatically and organizationally, but I tried. I hope it’s not too difficult to wade through.

Recently I've been buying women's clothes from a local thrift shop and wearing them in private.

PrincessLobster,asktransgender,(MtF) 4 months HRT and my body seems to be suddenly remasculinizing - please help?,"I've been on 6mg of E (morning, afternoon and evening) and 200mg of Spiro (morning and evening) for a little over 4 months, and things have been amazing. I love all the changes I've been seeing, but for some reason, everything has just gone wrong in the last week. I've been a complete wreck emotionally, more depressed than I've been since I started taking hormones. Then, today I looked in the mirror and noticed that my body is seemingly remasculinizing. My hips and boobs are smaller, face seems slightly less feminine, etc. I'm freaking out because I was finally starting to like my body for the first time, and now I just feel awful again. Does anyone have any idea why this could be happening? Possibly relevant details:

• I haven't changed my pill schedule within the last month, and I'm pretty consistent on taking them at the same time everyday.
• I've been dealing with a lot of crazy stress from other things in my life, and I feel more overwhelmed than ever.
• I've been smoking (weed) significantly more in the last week or so because it's what I did before HRT to cope, and I've been drinking a bit more too. Nothing crazy, but I went from maybe 2-3 drinks a week to 20-25 or so over the last two weeks.
• I drink peppermint and/or spearmint tea almost everyday for my sensitive stomach, but I know they're also natural anti-androgens. Spearmint I just started drinking within the last month or so. Maybe they're interfering with the Spiro somehow?

Thanks to anyone who has any ideas. "

I don't feel like any gender. I was assigned female at birth but the stereotypical image of a woman doesn't go with me. I don't like wearing dresses or make up or heels.

Although, i feel real bad when i am surrounded with women who have accepted their feminime side, i feel like i should have been like them,like something is wrong with me. But i can't force myself doing things i don't want to.
 I cannot really understand what feeling like a woman is like, neither what feeling like a man. What is it that make someone find their gender? I'm trying to determine my gender, but i really don't know what i am. Should i just have to calm down and try not to put a label or me?  "
stealingsunshine,asktransgender,How did you find your gender identity?,"Hello beautiful people! Since asking how I can better support transgender people, I have been reading up on all the terminology dedicated to gender/sex/orientation. It's been very enlightening and I've enjoyed sharing the information I've found. I do want to make sure that I get a full picture of how it's all related and how it works in our minds for each individual, so I was hoping I could ask a couple of questions to get some clarity. I appreciate any and all responses!

I know that gender identity is typically something we're conscious of between the ages of 18 months and 3 years. Given that there are so many variations of chromosomes, and that things like testosterone and estrogen don't exactly define your gender identity, I am wondering how you found your own gender identity or realized what it was. Did it ever change for you as you got older? Was it something that you realized later in your life when you realized that your gender expression had been influenced solely by social constructs?

Looking forward to your stories! Have a great night!"
CatsForLashes,asktransgender,"My gaff is way too painful when I sit, what can I do?","Ok, so I've made myself a gaff with a sock and some pantyhose, and when I put it on everything is fine; no pain, very little discomfort etc. I though everything would be great until I decided to try wearing it during my day at school.

I soon found out that sitting down sends a ton of pain to my left testicle, which kind of feels like hair being pulled, but even after I've shared the entire area, the pain persists! 

It's not absolutely horrible, but it's enough for me to lose my concentration and to need to remove it the second I get home. But wearing a gaff is necessary for me, since I have very large testicles! My bulge is always visible, no matter what I wear, so letting it free is absolutely not an opinion, but neither is living in pain for months until I can get an orchi!

I'm so depressed about this, what can I do? Is this normal? Will it ever go away or is there just something I'm not doing right?"

But every dream I have I'm cis male. Often I wake up and completely forget I am trans, sometimes it is only for a few seconds, sometimes it's half an hour. 



It's very confusing. I'm just any other cis guy in my dreams, I never dream about anything trans. If I dream about trans things, it's often someone in my family coming out as trans, but never anything about me. 


I've only dreamt once about living as female. I was wearing a dress, tights and heels and long hair and makeup. Even though everyone was transphobic in that dream, I felt amazing. When I'm in doubt I think back to that But that's been the only time, and that was in November.

ACoderGirl,asktransgender,Soreness after exercising day after injections,"Posting this here because it's specifically an estrogen injection, and perhaps trans men would also be knowledgeable here as T is injected in similar fashion.

Anyway, I've been on injected estrogen for a few weeks now. There's usually a little soreness in the following days after injecting. But now upon getting my workout back on track (the next day), I've found the injection area to be especially sore. It's possible that this is just a coincidence, but it seems quite likely that it's exercise related, as the pain started around the right time for exercise soreness. My other leg is a bit sore and stiff, but nowhere near as bad as the one that got injected into. Rubbing the leg, it's definitely worse near the injection site. It feels like the same muscle soreness that workout out hard can get (but the differences between my two legs is very prominent).

**Typical? Any way to reduce this (in severity or frequency)? If it's to be expected, how have others handled this?**

FFS_tatic,asktransgender,"My employer AT&amp;T expanded their transgender health coverage to full WPATH guidelines, inc. coverage for secondary sex characteristics. I just got approval for FFS! Happy rant, more details, and maybe AMA?","Firstly, throwaway to prevent potential trolling since my main account has potentially identifiable information. Secondly, I'm mostly just bragging but the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of AT&amp;T.

A couple weeks ago I got my official approval (and I finally worked out the coverage bumps today) that my employer sponsored healthcare from AT&amp;T is covering my facial feminization surgery. FFS is the procedure I've always felt is most necessary surgical component I needed for my transition, so the fact that it's being treated as medically necessary just like other more ""traditional"" gender confirmation procedures is pretty rad. As far as I'm aware I'm the first person at the company to utilize the expanded care options for FFS. 

I'm part of a group with other trans employees and allies and getting our coverage expanded has been one of the things we've worked on. When we brought our concerns up to Benefits/HR last year they were very welcoming and accepting at making our coverage better. I don't think they could've handled it any better, they genuinely seemed to care about making our coverage better and more inclusive. They were actually surprised that when they were told that over companies had better coverage, so they made it a priority to change the policy in time for Jan 1st of this year. I can not recommend AT&amp;T enough if you are looking for an employer that is accepting of LGBT people, has great trans health coverage, and is responsive to any issues or complaints. 

Previously our plans only covered genital surgeries and breast augmentation surgeries for both FtM and MtF. While I'm not sure I'm able to post the specifics for coverage, but if you've read the WPATH or HRC's guidelines for coverage it definitely includes everything in those. A short, non-inclusive list of things that are covered:

- FFS procedures (forehead contouring, jaw contorting, rhinoplasty, fat grafts, cheek/lip implants, trach shave, etc.)
- Hair removal
- Voice therapy/ voice modification surgeries 
- Hormone blockers and/or hormone therapy for under 18 dependents

I visited this forum a lot when I first started transitioning. It's been over two years since I've meaningfully participated in this community, but I remember then seeing a post from someone who talked about their insurance covering FFS and being jealous. So, I figure now that I'm in a similar situation, I'd put out a similar post. Mostly just bragging about my employer and that I'm getting rid of my biggest dysphoria cause after 4 years of transitioning, but AMA in case anyone wants to know more I guess. :P

taylanub,asktransgender,Historical evidence of anatomical sex dysphoria?,"This is a question specifically about concretely anatomy/body related sex dysphoria, i.e. strong discomfort with one's own genitals (and possibly also secondary sex traits). The question is not only aimed at people who experience that however; rather I wonder about historical (and cross-cultural) records of the condition. Say before the modern concept of ""transgender"" or even the concept of ""transsexual"" existed.

Background:

A common theory nowadays seems to be that this condition arises through a certain neurological profile. That is, the theory says, the brain of e.g. an anatomically male person develops in such a way, say during a critical period of development during pregnancy, that it attains a ""female"" status in some sense (maybe a very specific part of the brain that's sexually dimorphic), leading the neural system to expect the rest of the body to have female anatomy, leading to strong inherent discomfort with one's genitals first and foremost.

This would imply that the whole thing is 100% natural and has no relation to any social/cultural factors (such as e.g. the theory of men coming to subconsciously resent their penis because their subconscious mind grasps the fact that the existence of their penis makes society expect them to fit into traditional masculinity, when that goes against their true self).

If that naturalist theory is correct, it would mean that the phenomenon of concrete anatomy based sex dysphoria must be a cross-cultural and cross-historical phenomenon. This brings us to the question: are there records of this condition from around the globe and throughout human history?

Thanks in advance.

Subsidiary question: I didn't know how to google for this because the mainstream doesn't seem to distinguish between ""gender dysphoria"" (often defined in such a way that it relates to discomfort with traditional sex roles, sexist treatment, or else) and ""sex dysphoria"" (unrelated to traditional sex roles, purely related to one's anatomy). Not even the DSM seems very precise with such a distinction. If there's some terminology that I'm missing though, I'd be grateful to learn it.

Tibbett2,asktransgender,Getting sideburns removed?,"Hey! I'm a 25 year old trans girl, I've been getting laser hair removal for about 6 months now and growing my hair out for a bit before that. I have fairly curly hair and have begun to notice that I don't really see sideburns in women's hairstyles much. Would it be worth it to look into getting my sideburns taken care of with LHR or is there some benefit to keeping them in terms of style?

Edit: they're currently growing out from about at the bottom of my ear, for reference as to how low they are. I wouldn't be talking about getting rid of them completely, just about to the top of my ear instead.

Transgender_,asktransgender,Is this dysphoria or is it I just don't like the way I look on some days?,"I'm a young transgender woman and I can't distinguish if some days I have dysphoria over my face or not and I wanted some other transgender people's opinions on it.

Okay, for example, like yesterday I looked in the mirror when I was getting ready and I was like ""I'm really pretty"" (arrogant I know!) and today when I got up I looked in the mirror and I was looking at my brow bossing my jaw, my Adams apple and was just thinking, ""what if I get facial feminisation surgery and I don't loo any different or what if post op FFS I get clocked"".

I think I got those thoughts because I probably subconsciously thought ""how can my face be feminised so much that I look just like any other woman"", but obviously I don't know this for sure because I can't access my subconscious.

So, what do you think? Dysphoria or not?"

curryisprettygood,asktransgender,I think I'm going to come out this week,"Hey everyone !

First off, thanks to everyone who responded to my other post about high school &amp; when to come out. I took the things you said to heart.

So, I think I'm going to come out this week. With the encouraging responses about coming out during high school on my earlier post, I think I'm ready. 

I had a fight with my mom yesterday. My mom, while ultimately (hesitantly) supportive of what she just thinks are my ""wardrobe choices"", was upset because I only wear one pair of pants every day. It's the only pair of pants I have that is from the men's section (im ftm btw). Wearing ""womens jeans"" (clothes dont have a gender but I don't now how else to word it so) makes me extremely uncomfortable. A few months ago, I bought a bunch of womens clothing because I was in denial and trying to be the """"""""daughter"""""""" my parents wanted me to be, and they were kind of expensive. The second I tried them on at home I felt awful, and haven't touched them since. My mom started yelling at me about how I never wear them and how her money was wasted.

I almost came out in the moment out of anger, but I didn't. Now, though, I feel like something has changed. I feel like I need to explain to her why it is I only wear those jeans. Before, I was terrified she'd go through my phone and see my texts to friends about being trans. But today I found myself purposefully sabotaging myself so I'd leave my phone at home and maybe if she was nosy enough she'd check and know. I feel anxious to tell her now instead of anxious that she'd find out. Is this something everyone feels when they're ready to come out ?

On the other hand, it's my birthday soon, and I don't want to ruin that if she doesn't take it well. Should I wait until after my birthday (on sunday) ?"

abbyjames327,asktransgender,Transitioning and having kids,"Hello everyone, I have an appointment with an endo next month and am hopefully going to start HRT shortly there after. I am only out to a few people and so far everyone has been great. 

My wife had been so supportive of this whole process and I am so lucky to have her.  We will have been married 4 years this April and together for 10 years in May. And like many couples, we get asked about having children. We both want kids and have talked about it quite a few times over the last 5 years. 

But now with me beginning my transition, I just don't know how children would fit into our life. I know that banking sperm is a possibility or stopping hormones temporarily so that we can conceive but I just don't know what to do. I feel a bit lost in this regard and was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation. "

The soreness has mellowed out today, but my nipples are still really sensitive. Does this sound like my breasts are developing or am I just being optimistic?"

Like, I feel like killing myself is the only option now. I can't transition, I have no money, absolutely nothing. I have no clue what to do with my life. I've let my dysphoria take over my life, and now it's just driving me to suicide.

My parents think they are always right about everything (They never have been) and if I were to tell them I am feeling like this they will tell me I am wrong. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 11, and never told them about it becuase of this. I'm now 17 and still haven't.




I used to get suicidal about being AMAB, but now I'm suicial because I can't transition, go on HRT or anything. I'm purely existing, I am not living. I do not see any point in alive anymore.

Sojourney1,asktransgender,Has anyone's life become more difficult?,"Maybe I'm just in a depressive mood but I feel like my life has gotten categorically worse since transitioning. My mom, while supportive in her own way, thinks I'm sick in the head. Actually, I'm pretty sure most of my extended family feels that way. I'm afraid to visit them too. For fear of the bigots in the area (Tennessee). I don't think my mom would even want me to come home anyway. All my old friends probably feel the same way. Like I'm mentally ill. I don't want to just have queer friends but very few old friends seem to be real friends at this point. I'll never have my own kids because I couldn't afford to sperm bank. I can't afford any surgery either and I'm not even sure I really want GCS! I used to think I wanted it but I'm not so sure anymore. I mean what if I lose sensation? Or something goes wrong? I've never cared for Mr. ugly but what if the alternative is worse? Or I'm disappointed? I can't really sing anymore either. Something I used to love. If I sing now, I feel like I'll immediately out myself. And if I get vocal surgery, will I be able to sing at all? I feel like I'm having a trans mid-life crisis. I turn 30 this year and I'm not in a stable career because stupid me decided to go back to school. And med school at that! I'm looking at another 6-8 years! At least I pass, so I don't have to worry about that. Maybe I should just go back to my old career which I despised. The money was good, though. I just feel like there are more important things in life than transitioning. But I question that too as I sit here with $19 I'm my bank account. And then there's the religious aspect. I was... am a Christian but I have to wonder if I'm going completely against God. Please don't attack my religion btw. Sometimes it's the only thing that gets me through.
I guess I just need to rant and I don't have any friends who can understand. They're all either cis, super early in transition and/or completely disinterested. 

tl;dr: I question my decision to transition sometimes. Ultimately, I just hate that this is my life. Just needed to vent."

Aruselide,asktransgender,Did I pass?? (MTF),"Hi all,
this weekend I went to a social event in a club. It was an event mixed with lots of cis, LGBT, and BDSM people. I've been growing my hair for 3 years, I'm pretty short (5'6''--ish), very slim, but I used to be very muscular and I feel A LOT of dysphoria from this. I've gone down from 175 lb to 130 lb by stopping weightlifitng and eating very low protein for 2 years. I'm starting to have more of a ""fitness girl"" figure. I don't think my face passes (I've just started HRT this week, 3 sessions laser in), but I'm at least average-to-good at makeup, and I know how to hide the masculine features of my body and show off the good ones, I use high-quality materials, high-end clothing, etc.

So at some point in the night, I am with some very cool goth girls near a pool table. I'm wearing black leggings to show off my nice legs and booty (years of squats), ankle booties, and a long sleeved black crop top (I have a very very thin waist), with my long natural blonde hair down to almost my nipples.

Out of nowhere, this guy beelined toward me and straight up told me ""You look fucking incredible"".
I was startled and just said ""Thank you!""
I have not started voice training at all, so my voice is masculine.
His face changed and he just said ""Shiiit"", turned around, and walked away.

I couldn't help but have mixed feelings. Like, was he making fun of me? Or did I really pass for a minute?

In the end I just shrugged it off and was like, ""Thanks, but also, fuck you!"", but now it's been bugging me.

NotQuiteHeavensEnt,asktransgender,"I Am A straight man attracted to gender-fluidity, what do I call myself now?","I am working on a writing project about my personal sexual history, and I am having trouble picking out which word to use to describe myself.  I am not myself transgendered, but in the last year I have had brief, but positive and highly enjoyable relationships with two people who were.  They were each biologically female, and had not undergone any surgery or hormone therapy, which I admit was important to me.  I'd identified as a straight male my entire life up to this point by default, and my kinks are still to this day very much in line with those things that classically arouse straight men. (AKA I like breasts and vaginas, not penises.  Butts are case by case)

However, now that I have experienced (and quite enjoyed) sex with people who are not women, I no longer feel like the term ""straight"" applies to me.  It's an easy enough thing to ignore as it doesn't come up in conversation much, and I realize that this is a very minor problem.  But for the sake of my project (and indeed, my own sake moving forward) I want to take the question seriously and get it right.

So, what am I?  What word applies to me? I don't feel honest calling myself straight anymore. I'm not bisexual (one identified as gender-fluid, the other as gender-queer, neither called themselves male or female). I don't think pansexual is right because I do regard biological sex as important.  Queer fits, but vaguely, and I feel like that by itself begs more questions than it answers. Nearest I can tell is that I'm polysexual, but I can't say I'm certain I understand the term enough to be confident.

Slothentic,asktransgender,Why is being transgender so scary?,"This isn't as much a question as a vent, but its been on my mind a bit/lot and this seems like as good of a place as any to get it out.

Nearly a year ago I came to the conclusion in my head that I might just be transgender(mtf), and accepted it as not just a possibility, but explored it. Since then I've been going up and down not really sure what I am, certain that I'm a woman some days, then not sure at all the next while I discovered for myself.

To cut a long story short I know that I am a woman and I do not know how to tell people. I am scared that I will somehow change when I come out and that I will stop being me, and of a whole bunch of other things.

The main question; what fears did/do you have, how have you dealt with or overcome them, and if you know, why was it so scary?"

lacena,asktransgender,Trans girl here: How do you deal with pretending not to be trans but also desperately wanting to be out?,"My situation is a little weird. Since transition isn't an option for me right now due to transition being more-or-less illegal, I can't really do much for a few years.

I try my best not to let it get to me, mostly by burying myself in academia and hobbies, doping myself on caffeine, and trying to fill my mind with things so that I never have the time to think too much.

It also helps that I present male (not that I have a choice).

It gets weirder, because then, even though I *say* I'm a guy I don't hide my obviously non-masculine actions. There's a bit of a running gag among some of the people around me (to whom I am not out) that I'm actually not a guy, but a girl.

They're right, but they don't know that, and so I have to do this insane mental acrobatic fucking pirouette where I'm inwardly smiling but outwardly telling them to ""knock it off with the lacena-is-a-girl jokes"", but then I say it in a playful, teasing way and so nobody can say that I ""doth protest too much"". 

It's like an open closet inside a closet inside another closet. It's a level of closet so deep that I could give the Inception team a headache.

I don't even know what's going on myself anymore. I've stacked so many lies on top of each other that real life doesn't even feel real anymore. It feels like I'm an actress in a stage play instead.

I have many more years of this insanity ahead of me. How do I deal with this?"
PanTran420,asktransgender,I picked up my prescription today and now I have a big decision to make.,"I got my prescription about a month ago, but didn't have my insurance card from work yet, and then I was broke from too many snow days at work and couldn't afford it. Pay day was today, so I went ahead and grabbed it.

My big concern now, however, is that I have yet to store sperm. I've been waffling on the necessity of it for a while. At first I was 100% sure I wanted to do it. Now I'm starting to think it's not necessary for me and I'm doing it more because it will make my parent's happier. My parents have offered to help pay for it, but money is tight for them too right now, so it can't be done right away.

On one hand, I'd like to have kids some day. I've always thought about biological kids, but I'm very open to adoption. I'm also not sure what my orientation will be coming throughout the transition, so biological kids might not be a concern anyway. I'm pan now, and primarily romantically female attracted, but I've been thinking about dating men a lot more recently, even without the E boost.

Financing it is going to be the big hurdle. As I mentioned above, my parents are willing to help, but they are tight on money and it could be April before they are able to contribute much. I'm going to be moving apartments in April as well, so finances are going to be tighter than usual. 

I'm soooo glad I have a therapy appointment on Monday. I've got a lot to think about."
Naywenne,asktransgender,"To all my brothers and sisters who feel hopeless, please read my story.","I'm 6'4"" and 350 lbs. I have been since I was 16. I'm also MTF. All of my life, I've felt completely hopeless. I would never be who I wanted to be... rather, who I -needed- to be.

I've known I was trans since I was 18. I saw a special on TLC or something about trans people, and it all just clicked. More than a decade of questions were answered for me in a single one hour special. This also happened to be in the same month I met the woman who is now my wife.

So, here I am with my eyes now wide open. It didn't take long for her to learn my ""Curiosity"" was something far more complex. She was afraid that I'd want to go ""all the way"" at some point. I reassured her I would never do that, and at the time I meant it. Once again, I was 6""4"", 350 lbs... Oh, did I mention I was wearing size 16 MENS shoes? Yeah, that too. Becoming a woman was a pipe dream at that point in my life. I -knew- it would never become a reality.

Over the years, I tried on tried on her clothes, had ""sexy"" times role-playing as the woman, all the fun stuff. Slowly but surely, the depression was showing it's ugly face. But it was manageable. I could bury it for the longest time. I -had- to. ""Me? A woman? Yeah right! I'd look like Godzilla in heels!"" and ""I'll never pass"" and my personal favorite ""I just don't have the money... I could never even begin to afford transition""

The depression was so bad for so long... I worked as a security guard, so I had so many hours alone... just me and my thoughts. So many seemingly endless nights where I just wanted -everything- to end, but it was growing. Etching away at my defenses. It was becoming so big I couldn't stop it. The suicide thoughts became suicide attempts. I found my self sitting in the car in a dark parking lot with all the stuff I needed to end my life laying around me... I cried myself to sleep, only to wake up an hour later feeling empty and confused.... but missing my wife. I went home that night instead of ending my life...

That night was not the end of my life. It wasn't the end of my suicidal thoughts, either. It took some time, but I finally decided it was time to start changing my life. It was TIME. I came out to all my family and friends, and I started dressing full time when I wasn't at work. Mostly androgynous outfits, but a skirt if I was feeling -really- brave that day. After doing that for about a year, I finally had the courage to ask my family and friends to start calling my by my new name. It was a little rough and there were lot's of slip ups, but -mostly- everyone tried.

Six months or so after that, I quit my then current job (where I did not feel it was safe to come out) and starting looking for a new one. Each position I applied for read ""Deadname (Katheryn) Lastname"" on the resume. I finally landed a job where I was hired as Katheryn and was openly transgender to everyone. That went okay with a lot of the people there, save for a couple who -did not- agree with my ""Lifestyle.""

This was a huge milestone in my life. I was completely out an open in every aspect of my life. But I still had my hangups... Still 6'4"", still literally 350 lbs. Still feeling hopeless. A lot of nights saying ""Yeah, I've done these things... but I'm still me. I will never see myself as a woman. I will never be happy in my own skin"" I -loved- the word 'never.'

Between this job and my next, my wife finally pushed me into seeing an informed consent hormone doctor. 2 visits and $68 dollars I had a ""Titty Sticker"" stuck to my belly! This was when I finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel!!!

So, time went on and things happened... I changed jobs, still openly transgender. I was hired as Katheryn and ensured it would not be an issue. I ended up getting backed into a corner (figuratively) at my new job. I was told that for ""Legal Reasons"" I couldn't express who I was because my legal name didn't match up with my gender identity. We though about fighting it legally, but said fuck it, and had my name legally changed! it was the motivation we finally needed to just -do it.-

So at this point I'm on HRT and legally going by my new name... I'm starting to think to my self: ""WTF? Is this actually happening?"" I'm very happy, but I still have ""passing"" in the back of my mind. I've accepted I'll never pass, but it doesn't exactly make me happy. I'm still getting depressed, but the though of -actually- killing myself is gone... I still think about it, but I don't feel like I need to do it anymore!

So time keeps going on... Emotions are getting a little crazy as my body adapts to the hormones. One night at work, I'm feeling COMPLETELY worthless. I'm not who I want to be and I'm in a dead end job. But this is where it hit me... I just needed to take control. 

I applied for yet another job in a completely different line of work (Thanks to my nephew, who wouldn't SHUT UP about it! ;P) and it turned out to be one of the best moves in my life. I'm working for a tech start up that values it's employees, and not only has plenty of room for advancement, but does everything in it's power to make sure you succeed.

I met someone while in training who has become my first ""Girlfriend."" She's been amazing and I feel like I can talk about anything with her. (She has done so much for me and my confidence, it's crazy!) No one knows me as my old Deadname, and every single employee has made me feel welcome and safe.

I've been wanting to write this for a while now, so that -you- know you can do it. What finally made me sit down and do it? I was at the store today looking at hair clips. There was a young boy and girl (12-13) in the isle. They left shortly after I got there. After a few moments the boy came back around the corner and said ""Hey... I'm just wondering... I'm just curious... Are you a boy or a girl?""

I about fucking DIED... I DID IT!!!!! I always said ""I know I'll never pass... but if someone looks at me and they aren't sure. I'll be happy."" I know he was just a kid, but still. Today is the biggest victory so far. I am so over the moon I cant stop smiling.

EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Am I justified in feeling upset in this situation or am I just overthinking everything?,"So when my friends and I go out in the evening we usually have 2 groups of predrinks which is almost always the cis girls, and everyone else.

3 of the 4 cis girls live near each other at location A, along with 2 cis guys. Most of the cis guys and one trans girl live in location B. I live near the other cis girl, K, near location C which is roughly equidistant from A and B. I'm pretty close friends with all the cis girls, more so than the guys which a few of the girls know. 

When organising it, someone will say ""I'll host for location B"" which means everyone who wants to go. The cis girls will have their own predrinks without us but don't say which I understand if they want to hang out just the girls for a bit or whatever. 

The thing that upsets me is that all my friends know I'm trans even though I'm not living out with them (long story due to not having a compartmentalised life) but they don't invite me to predrinks at A. If I ever ask they say ""oh it's just because we all live near and we wouldn't want K to be with the guys alone"". Am I overthinking/overreacting because they don't include me even though I'm not one of the guys cause they see me as one, or they think I'm close to them (I'm closer than the girls are but not as close as I am to the girls). Should I just be like ""at the end of the day I'm still living as a guy and as such I'll be treated like one"" or am I justified in being upset that I'm not in with the cis girls. I wouldn't mind if I lived closer to location B but it's the fact I live so close to K that it's almost like me and her should go to the same place (she's also my best friend which is another reason I'd want to be with her at the beginning of the night). 

Idk I feel like this sets me up to feel shit all night because it starts with a ""you're still a man"" which I try to not think. But I also feel like I'm overreacting because the 4 girls are really close as a group and I'm friends with them individually but I don't really fit the group probably because I'm not living as a girl. 

Sorry for the word vomit and if it doesn't make sense but I just wanted to get this off my chest and maybe some other opinions."
Questioning-Alt,asktransgender,To the transwoman I saw at that wedding last summer.,"I'm sitting at my computer, struggling to find the right words to say, so I'm going to keep this as short as possible.

If my staring made you feel uncomfortable, I'm so sorry.

If I can remember correctly, you were wearing a red dress. You probably saw a boy with glasses staring at you. You probably felt like shit because of that. You felt like you were never able to pass.

What happened had been somewhat of a load on my consciousness ever since then. I feel like I owe you an apology, even if you will never read this. Maybe you don't use this subreddit. Maybe you weren't even trans and I was just overthinking things.

The idea of being seen as a woman is something I've wanted for a while now and it's posed a lot of complicated questions for me. So just know that I was staring with a sense of envy, not disgust.

Just wanted to put that out there."

DGunner,asktransgender,Getting laser hair removal after being on hormones,"Hey! 

I haven't posted on here in a while. Anywho, I have been on hormones for almost a year now, and I still haven't started laser or electrolysis yet because... well... it's complicated.

I have noticed a few of my beard hairs are starting to turn blonde? Am I doomed? Will they be there forever now?

Is electrolysis better or is laser better?

Bonus question:

Has anyone else been on hormones for a year and is still nowhere near ""passing"" yet? 

How do you cope?"
cammur,asktransgender,Ever think about the way you relate to people with different gender identities?,"Been thinking a lot about the way I relate to people of different genders with being trans in mind. Almost all of my closest, truest friends are girls, and with the ones I've come out to it feels like some invisible barrier has been lifted and my relationships are improving like crazy. With my guy friends, I'm confortable relating to them as male, but it's starting to feel more forced and kind of weird, but that didn't happen until I really started exploring transition (or maybe more likely I'm just more aware of it?). With my friends who are non-binary, I feel similarly to my girl friends with the added benefit that I understand their experience better and I can just see them as the beautiful humans they are. I'm just wondering if other people have experienced difficulty relating to people not of their gender in similar or different ways as they explore their gender. Sorry if that was confusing haha��"

RikkuAsh,asktransgender,Clothes for sports?,"So I'm thinking of heading up to one of my old football teams just to train the odd evening here or there. Fitness and weight 
 Soccer football. They train almost right beside me, grew up with some of the guys on it, and the standard is much lower than what I used to play at before hormones. Perfect really.

Problem is that I haven't played properly in about a year and a half. In which I'm up to a c cup. Don't ever wear bras. But I feel like if I had to run I'd definitely need one, let alone playing football. Would a sports bra be my best option? Was thinking of just using my old training gear which includes hoodies and training tops. Doesn't have to completely hide them, although making my chest look not so obvious might help.

Completely at a loss with bras. Especially sports ones. Or any other options? Have really missed my football. Desperate to play a little. "

The whole point of the trans movement is to look beyond what's in someone's pants, yet we use the traditional symbols that represent what's in someone's pants. The male symbol = penis and scrotum.  Female symbol = womb/uterus and vagina/cervix.  

Another interpretation of the gender symbols suggests that the male symbol is a sword and shield, and the female symbol is a hand mirror!  Pretty sexist if you ask me.  "

TeaspoonRaccoon,asktransgender,FtM identity question,"Hello again! &lt;3 I return with another question.
So my family all knows I'm trans now. They are supportive and I couldn't be more happy. However, my father said something to me today that I've been ruminating on and I can't quite make sense of it. 
He told me in order to be a boy, I need to first experience the other side of the coin entirely. In other words, I need to go whole hog woman and experiment all there is to experience as a woman. Howeeeverrr.... That just seems really off to me. Like, neither my brother or father had to do that to make sure they were men. Plus, I can't even begin to tell you how uncomfortable that would make me.
So, is he right? Should I experience womanhood before I set my foot down? I know in my heart I'm trans, and I know my dad has never experience being trans, but my dad is also a very profound and intelligent individual.

Thanks in advance. xoxo"

transconfusedaf,asktransgender,Does anyone else dislike it when their dysphoria goes down and feels the need to 'trigger' it?,"I keep feeling this way, and now I am out more within the past few weeks my dysphoria has slowly been going down.


At home, it's quite bad but when I am out it's often not that bad. When I am around other girls I feel ""oh, being male is actually fine. Why am I wanting to be a girl?"" but when I am alone I feel ""this is terrible! I need HRT and need to transition ASAP!""



Not sure what thoughts to trust, because I don't like being male in private, but I am fine with it in the real world. It's so frustrating. 




Sometimes, when I am alone and my dysphoric thoughts go away, I sometimes just don't think I am not trans, I don't like it and just go on this sub or /r/mtf or something, I just dislike it a lot.



I sometimes avoid going out because I know it will make me feel less trans, and I actually like the weekend because I am home alone I can think about being a woman."

PennyLisa,asktransgender,Oh for fuck's sake old friend.,"So I've known this guy for like 20+ years, he was the MC at my wedding. My second oldest friend (oldest I've known since birth). He's usually identified as left wing, and always had strong political views.

He also supported me when I came out, and was one of the first people I told.

So he recently posted on FB (I paraphrase):

&gt; I'm leaving the left. It's all a bunch of special interest groups whining loudly about how they aren't treated fairly. This marginalizes white, hetrosexual, males.

My response:

&gt; I know sometimes it can seem like that, and for sure some people do take it too far, but you agree with equality for everyone right? I'm not trying to slur you here, but as a white hetro male have you ever been disowned by family for your sexual identity? Have you been denied employment? Have friends just... disappeared when you came out as straight? I have well and truly had my eyes opened to the sexism and hetro-ism in society, and it's not good. I think sometimes special interest groups need to talk about it because it's the only way they can be treated fairly.

His response:

&gt; I'm leaving the left, bunch of whingers!

princesspeachless,asktransgender,My therapist is taking her time getting me my letter for hormones and it's making me nervous...,"Hi all! I just recently decided to take the plunge and made myself an appointment to get hormones. I went to a therapist who referred me to an OB/GYN and I made an appointment. This was two weeks ago, and she said she was going to get me my letter for her colleague, who would be meeting with me week to week, to give to me.

Week one I asked her for the letter, and she said she would get it to me in our next session. Week two I asked again and she said she would email it to me. That was on Monday. I got in touch with her yesterday and she said she would get my letter to me by the end of the day.

I'm not sure what to do! My appointment is on Monday, and I'm getting really nervous that it will be all for naught. I don't feel like she has any malicious intent but at the same time my experience has taught me that people tend to miss deadlines when it doesn't directly affect them."
throwawayhelpmedeath,asktransgender,I'm at a complete loss about what to do.,"I just turned 16 and am an 11th grader in a NYC high school.

I want to die.

I can't focus on anything in school. I understand the material and everything, but I still can't do anything. When I'm at home I don't feel like doing anything but crying or trying to go to sleep. I know how to do homework but sitting down, grabbing a pen, and actually writing anything seems like the most tedious thing in the world. I don't know what to do about school. I don't want to fail any of my classes but I'm really scared that I'm going to.

I can barely ever leave my room. Going outside is fucking horrifying. I look like a girl. There is absolutely nothing about my body that would make it seem like I'm a guy. Whenever I go outside I know everyone around me sees me as a girl and it fucking pisses me off.  Even in school when I try to ask classmates to call me he most of them look at me like I'm crazy and never get it right. I don't blame them because of the way I look but it makes me feel horrible. I don't want to have to correct everyone all the time because I look fucking stupid dressed like a girl asking people to call me he.

I want to be able to just leave my house for five minutes without wanting to go into a crying fit. Even when I'm at home I want to die. I'm not allowed to dress male in any way. Seeing myself in a mirror or touching my own body makes me want to rip my skin off and tear my body apart.

I just gave one of my teachers a letter yesterday about having trouble in school but I don't know if he's read it yet or not. I'm really scared about what he's going to say to me. I'm really really scared that he might contact my parents and say something to them. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to feel normal for once and be able to go to school like every other person I see every day. I promise that I'm not just being lazy and that I actually WANT to do work for school but I don't know how to calm down and stop freaking out for long enough to do anything."

18feb17,asktransgender,Could my sexual frustration in my early-mid teens made me dysphoric?,"As the title says, this is what makes me doubt I am trans more than any other reason.

I'm quite embarresed about this (note the throwaway). I've never posted about this on here before, nor have I ever planned on telling a therapist (When I see one). I'm almost 18, and (maybe) MTF. I'm out to a few friends, but mostly closeted.



When I started liking girls, around age 11/12, I started becoming quite sexually aware. I'd daydream about having sex a lot at 12, I had this massive crush on this one girl but I never did anything because I was too anxious (I have social problems, I struggle to make friends and talk to others)


This continued when I was 16, but I became more sexually frustrated. All my friends had girlfriends by 16, they where doing stuff with girls, I never could and it would make me depressed because of it. There was this one girl I became very friendly with, I almost went out with her but she moved away.


I was never dysphoric at this time. I never really thought about being a girl, that didn't come until I almost turned 17. I did crossdress in private, although that was more of a fetish than anything.



It's almost like I want to be a girl, but the only reason why I am having dysphoria is because the lack of girls, if that makes sense. I never really had any female friends.




It feels like if I did go out with that girl when I Was 16, I wouldn't be like this now. I feel like if I were to have a partner right now, the dysphoria would probably go away. I can imagine myself being a girl, but I can't see myself having sex with girls as female, but I could see myself having sex with girls as female, and the same for males (I am bi).



I'm not sure what to do about this. Could it be possible that no female attention has made my dysphoric? It seems to me a good reason, but I'm not sure if it is or not.

PossibleMTF1,asktransgender,I feel illegitimate w/ (possibly) being trans?,"I've been questioning for about 6 months now, and I've come to the conclusion I'm probably not cis (Amab). So that leaves me w/ either probably being non binary or trans female. There are lot of commonalities and similar experiences that I have w/ other mtfs including praying, etc. However I feel illegitimate for a number of reasons also. I don't dislike my body, at least I don't think. I don't have facial hair or much body hair in general for that matter but also a lot of cis guys don't. My body is objectively a good one and I'm very attractive, so maybe that's holding me back some. I also don't dislike pronouns. However there is something that might be dysphoria. I've been struggling more and more w/ people seeing me as intimidating and unapproachable, and it hurts my social life and makes me and others uncomfortable. I've thought that might be connected to dysphoria but I'm not sure. I'm also not sure if it's masculinity that I'm describing that I dislike but all I know is something has to change. 

 If I am trans female I feel I would be pretty tomboyish and masculine. I've often desired to look a lot like Milla Jovovich in resident evil, Angelina Jolie in tomb raider, or ruby rose. While I understand there still women, those characters are very tomboy and masculine, which makes me feel illegitimate. I feel people would question why I would transition if I wanted to present that way. What do you think?"

ZelkyZo,asktransgender,I need help!,"It's come to my attention that the time has come for me to move out.

I can't keep living with my family.  I am getting nowhere by continuing to live here.  My family is morally supportive, but is too busy with work and school, and has no patience or tolerance towards me due to my special needs.  I depend on them far too much for my own well being, and this has to stop before it's too late.  I have to move out so I can finally get the help and support I need.

However, I have no place to go.  I have no distant friends or relatives that I know of who can take me in and help me.  I don't know what my options are, other than that I need to get out of here no matter what.

I have a car and can drive myself anywhere in the continental US.  I have few skills, virtually no work experience, minimal college experience, no significant skills, and limited funds in savings originally meant for transition.  I can't afford going back to school either, even with financial aid.  I have extreme complications regarding social and environmental sensitivities and anxieties that make most low-skill jobs inaccessible to me.  I am on the autistic spectrum, and suffer with depression, severe anxiety, and ADHD as well.  I am on SSI and Medicaid.  I still present male and will continue to do so for awhile, unfortunately.

I need to find a place to live where I can get help.  I don't need much space, just peace, acceptance, and assistance getting on my feet.  I can't do this on my own.  I've been trying to for over half a decade, and I've made virtually no progress.  I need to find help overcoming my disabilities so I can find work I enjoy so I can save up for transition costs and my future career goals.  Nobody so far has been able and willing to help me in the slightest.  D:

What are my options?  Where can I find help?  What do I look for?  Who can help me?  I don't have any other options left...  ;_;

---

**Tl;dr:**  Making no life progress so I need to move out.  Multiply disabled with no other contacts, work experience, education, or skills.  Can drive anywhere if necessary, don't care how far.  Need help finding place to get on my feet so I can transition and be independent."

The sexual side effects (reduction of erections/ejaculate, breast growth) don't worry me nearly as much as this. 

To anyone here who has used or is using finasteride: how has your experience been? Have you noticed any cognitive issues as a result of the drug?"
pinkchips,asktransgender,"Does anyone have any experience going from DIY to a proper endo? I'm scared they are going to want me to come off HRT for new baseline blood tests, and I'm not willing to do that.","So I should finally have an appointment with a proper endocrinologist next month.  The problem is that I have been successfully DIY for months now, and I feel like I did a spiffy job.  
  
I got comprehensive baseline blood tests (https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/5ip4co/my_baseline_test_results_finally_came_in_normal/), slowly upped my dosage while monitoring blood levels, and am now in normal female ranges (https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/5sgzvd/fourth_test_results_are_in_i_already_had_normal/).  
  
However it seems the consensus is that an endo is gonna want me to cease all HRT for months to obtain new baseline blood tests.  
  
Lol, no.  It's just not gonna happen.  I already have baselines, and I am in normal ranges and seeing good results.  There is literally no good reason I can think of to do a huge reset and put my body through that kind of stress, not to mention months of lost transition.  
  
Did anyone else work with an endo that didn't require them to stop their current regimen?  "

ShannonTheWereTrans,asktransgender,I came out to my little sister,"So I came out to my sister a few days ago, and it went better than I hoped. She and the rest of my family are super Catholic and hate anything related to GSM or what they consider abnormal. My parents have expressed their beliefs that we're literally insane and that we're morally corrupt. I'd probed my little sister about the topic and she seemed to be respectful toward trans people. I thought I could make an ally of her, so I came out after my birthday dinner.

Two days later she sent me a series of text messages saying that she loved me but didn't support me. She said transitioning is immoral and that I need me some Jesus to help me love myself instead of this path. I tried to explain myself and show her how the Catholic Church doesn't expressly condemn transitioning, but she kept to her beliefs. She said she loved her faith too much to support me.

Weirdest thing is, I'm not angry at her or upset that she won't accept me as I am. I expected as much. I'm not even that scared that I'll lose her, though I'll fight to keep her in my life. I feel partly to blame,  like maybe I could've handled coming out better. I'm also sad for her, because she doesn't know how to love someone who challenges her world view. Love without support isn't really love, is it? But she sees those two as separate, like she can love me while trying to fight against me treating dysphoria.

How do I help her see that who I am is a good thing? Or does she just need time for all this to become normal?"

I asked them what gender they would choose to be born as, and they answered a girl but insisted they were not unhappy with being male. They insisted that they had no signs of dysphoria, I told them that they don't need to have it and I also linked the usual articles that get linked. However they didn't exactly like either of them.

beast_m,asktransgender,How emotionally upsetting is it to use a bathroom that doesn't comport with how you identify?,"I consider myself very progressive on nearly all social issues but I'm having a difficult time summoning as much passion for the bathroom-bill issue as I do for issues like gay marriage, euthanasia, etc.

I think one of the reasons for the relative apathy is that it just doesn't seem all that traumatizing to be required to use a bathroom that may not conform with the gender with which you identify. Don't get me wrong, I find the bathroom bills, in a word, just *dumb*...mostly because it's almost always a bad idea to codify intolerance. But when the arguments start turning to the ""inhumanity"" of requiring someone to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender at birth, I simply find it harder to empathize. Apologies if that sounds small-minded, but I'm posting here to learn. Perhaps some trans posters can explain to someone like me (who thinks he would feel just as comfortable using a men's room as a ladies' room) why the bathroom issue is so important, or if you think I'm otherwise missing something about what makes it uncomfortable to be required to use one bathroom over the other."
quizzical-qisak4,asktransgender,I'm (16F). My dad (41M) came out as non-gender binary to us and Mom is freaking out over it.,"On Tuesday my dad told us, out of the blue, over dinner, that he was non-gender binary, said he'd known since 1989 that he didn't fit either gender binary and that he was uncertain what pronoun changes to use, but said ""Never refer to me as they, it's fucking impersonal calling someone they"".

I'm not sure which pronoun to use since he isn't sure!, but I'm referring to him as he since he's still presenting as male (for now) and he has said ""I'm not transgender either"".

He's also floated these words around a lot too, saying he's androgyne and genderqueer and wants to be with Mom still.

Mom is freaking out over this; she isn't being hateful or spiteful or transphobic, but she's not coping well, she says she still loves him but is questioning whether to divorce him.

He said, even in this ""new form"" (as he calls it) of being non-binary, that one thing is certain; women are the only sex he's attracted to and will ever sleep with.

I'm worried about this situation, although I have no issue with other non-gender binary people, it's causing me worry trying to understand the whole thing.

BTW we live in a small conservative town here in California, it's not known for anything vaguely LGBT-related, instead it's guys with SUVs and pickup trucks, and it's a small community, everyone knows everyone else here.

I don't know what to do and am struggling for help here.

If you could all help me out with this, I'd be grateful to you guys.

Dragoic,asktransgender,Could use some advice again,"So i went to see a doctor, which forwarded me to a clinic and i was at last getting my hopes up. Until the questions hit.

I told them my story and said everything about how I've felt since i was 15, but then both the doctor and person at the clinic kept going on 2 questions.

Why do you still have facial hair? I became numb and locked up, it felt like I've just failed and i tried to explain as much as i dead person could that i first now have really got the feeling and I've tried to blend in with other males to make life easier and make myself somewhat acceptable to look at in the mirror without crying on the inside

The second question was why i was wearing male clothes still and why i was not in some big city walking around in a dress. I tried to explain that i was already very insecure and I've been bullied a lot in my teens and wearing a dress would have made me an easy target for people to point fingers at and make me even more depressed. How would i ever have gotten a job or anything looking like a balding( Yet still savable if treatment is started within some years) walking around in a dress. I sure would not get a good job to help pay for the operations. 

In short i broke down mentally later that night so bad that my friend came and his sister too. A shaking dead body where hope just oozed out of.

So now I've written down a lot of feelings about it to next meeting. But i feel like an animal for them to experiment with, without care that i need a daily life and a work to do, that requires me to be face to face with a lot of random people. They even said that they needed to see if i fit the role of the gender?.. role?.. as in 2 options for personality A: Male, love to be dominant, strong, nothing touches his body hair nor his manly beard and he knows his the alpha male or option B: Female, Love pink, cheerful as hell and paint rainbows everywhere she goes and spend 24/7 on makeup and doing nails. I fit non of them. I want the body and get unlocked so i at least can start feeling something again. I could not even be happy on my beloved sisters wedding which  was 4 days ago.

As it is now can't i start HRT without 6 months for them validating me, so until then am i their toy to do with as they please unless i give up and just live like a walking corpse. 

Is it just so normal for trans-person that have discovered themselves after suppressing themselves so many years to have walked in a dress in public and know everything about makeup and be super girly? or is the person that would be the one to validate me just unable to understand that some people just needed to be like me and hide it all until the day i find myself comfortable enough to switch over?

Malorie_here,asktransgender,My two cents on the trump decision,"This was a comment on another sub but I felt compared to share it.

""Don't let this human push pop scare us out of what we have already attained. Go to the bathroom of your preferred gender, maybe don't go alone if it isn't safe but visibility is important now and if we lay down and accept their law as a determining factor in our lives we're giving them more power than they actually possess. Now is the time to stand and fight for ourselves; also remember that Love conquers all, love triumphs over hate and these people with the need to oppress and subjugate people will not succeed, they will not get their ideal America through nazi tactics. They will fall or simply die and be forgotten. Please don't lose sight of the future, our future is bright despite this over aggressive minority and they will shrink as time passes. Don't shower them with hate because it only fuels their disdain for us. Kill these individuals with kindness, give no one reason to say you're anything less than amazing and if they do you can be reassured that it is their fight against reality that they are bringing to you. Their hate is a reflection of an internal climate of negativity and shame, let them kill themselves, show them how great we are and how shitty they are through actions."""
Ringhal,asktransgender,Sissy porn.,"So I discovered sissy porn the other day. Or rather was shown it by a friend of mine.

thr0wnaway101,asktransgender,Anybody transitioned alongside Group Health?,"Obligatory wall-of-text apology. 

Well first and foremost, I'm wondering if anybody has any experience with Group Health for trans care. I know they talk about providing ""Gender Identity and Transgender Issues"" care, but there isn't much information. I personally am covered by them but haven't raised any gender identity issues to any Group Health employee, and I don't know if I want to bring it up without knowing how things will proceed. Does anybody have any experience with their transgender health services? I'd be MTF but anybody's input is welcome.

I ask this in the first place because I'm . . . not feeling great. I've taken the obvious advice--I've been talking to a therapist about gender identity and sexuality (not synonymous, I know) for a few weeks, and I'm very glad that I have been; but I don't know that it's enough. I'm getting very scared and upset about how real things are, and rather than feeling more certain of anything I feel as lost as ever.

I feel like I'm running out of non-permanent things to do to explore myself, and I certainly don't feel like I've ""solved"" anything. As I've posted about, I've been questioning to some degree for a very long time, and for the last two or three months I've been trying to deal with it in earnest. Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm just a gay male (which would still be . . . drastic, for me), and sometimes I feel quite certain that I'm trans. Plus, I'm right on the edge of coming out (as *something*)--I really want to tell my friends and my mom and my brother, and every time I talk to them I feel like it could just burst out of me at any moment, but at the same time I feel like it's too soon, I don't have it figured out enough, what if it doesn't go well or I'm wrong, etc etc etc.

I look at myself in the mirror (despite my long hair and skinny frame) and hate what I see--I don't feel feminine at all, feeling masculine doesn't make me happy, and I'm now really struck by just how far gone I am. I'm 26 and haven't done any blockers or hormones; it fills me with distress to know that no matter what I do, my hips will probably never widen, maybe my waist will never narrow, blah blah blah--the damage is done. But even so, there are a million other things that make me doubt myself--""Am I really trans, even though I prefer women's clothes and wish I had female proportions and a bunch of other things?""

I'm trying to be mature and thoughtful about figuring myself out, and to approach it methodically, but I probably don't have to tell you how hard that is. In fact, I don't even know if I'm asking a question or venting at this point, but I appreciate that I can at least put these feelings out there. Thanks.

TL;DR - Counseling is slow and I'm getting distressed."

In advance, thank you so much for your understanding and any honest help you can provide! Apologies as well if some of the language I use is unhelpful. I'm grateful for any guidance and learning in this area. 

A few years ago, my sister (currently identifying as birth gender) came out as gay to my family. We had a pretty evangelical upbringing but for the most part have all abandoned the parts of it that would keep us from embracing her fully. She is out to most of her friends, family, and community. She had a girlfriend a few years ago (my parents loved the girlfriend) but ultimately my sister ended things because she was uncomfortable exploring the relationship sexually. She is almost 25, still living with my parents after a few tough years in the military (exhibits depression and PTSD), and has returned to university. All of this to say - she's going through a LOT right now. A few years ago she wrote me a letter from her station in Afghanistan intimating that she hates her body, feels uncomfortable with it, could see herself as an FTM, but ultimately would always think that she ""was a woman with a fake penis"" (her words).

This past weekend she and my parents came to visit me and when we were alone she said she thinks she's trans. She said she's afraid of transitioning in this climate, but I think based on the above there's probably a lot more going on as well that is contributing to her anxiety. My question to this community is: for someone who's struggling to identify or put into words their trans identity, what resources would you recommend? Did you find talking to a specific therapist helpful? Did you attend a support group? I want to be a safe person for her to speak to and am planning on joining a local PFLAG support group; were there other trans-specific groups that you found helpful? I realize that there's a lot that is self-defeating in describing someone as ""struggling to identify as trans"" but I'm grateful for any insight or experience you can share. She lives in a small town, has weird VA insurance and I'd love to be able to provide and be a resource as she spends time processing this and coming to an action.

Thanks,

Here's my second thought, if I did have kids later, I would be fine with adopting, because I don't care if they are genetically related to me. But again, I feel like that may change.

My parents are offering to pay for banking until I move out, but my problem is that I don't think I will be able to afford it when I move out, and I don't want all that money to go to waste.

The thing is, if I was given the chance to be a cis boy i would take it, and transitioning socially seems right (although a little scary because of all the coming out stuff) but transitioning physically seems right only to an extent, the more I think about it the more right it seems but I'm afraid I might be pushing myself to ignore the aspects of it that terrify me (which is really only all the things that happen to your vagina on T or how bottom surgeries are) and that if I go through with it I might regret it.

I still love them, though. They're both really funny and intelligent and kind. I could talk with either of them for hours, and aside from being peeved peeved at my lack of cisnormativity, they really care about me.

The past few nights I've had dreams about coming out to them. I don't plan on doing so until I enter college - we're all stubborn and loud, I'll get interrupted and called a crazy feminist before I can finish explaining anything and then I'll get really mad and start screaming. But the dreams have really been getting me down. It's always really calm and easy, and they always seem so understanding. Then I wake up and realize that I can't have that.

start315,asktransgender,Which states in the US are best for transgender rights?,"Hello!

I am from Lithuania, which is in Northeastern Europe, I am going to work in USA during the coming summer for about 3 months. I'm 23 y/o MtF, mostly passable but tall and with wide shoulders so still a bit insecure about my passability in the summer :)

I could look for jobs anywhere throughout the country but I am a bit worried about very different transgender acceptance levels depending on a location. Especially, I wouldn't want to be afraid to use bathrooms of my own gender, so Florida, Arizona, Kentucky, Texas and North Carolina are off my list already. It's illegal there for transgender people to use bathrooms not matching the gender assigned at birth.

Mariamatic,asktransgender,Questions about MtF hormone self-treatment,"Hey guys,

I've been wanting to get on hormones for a while but the problem is I've been moving around every 4 months or so for school for a couple years and so I haven't ever been able to make any regular appointments with any doctors. I won't be settling down until the end of this year most likely when I graduate and am planning to move back overseas to Japan. I had planned to wait for that time to start the process but lately I have been noticing that I am starting to get a lot more negative effects from testosterone and my appearance is becoming more masculine, so I really would like to start as soon as possible in order to start reversing that before it gets any worse, and if I wait until the end of the year and then wait until my health insurance is settled and I can get into the doctor, it will have been a lot longer than I would like to risk it for, and worse if I end up living far from Tokyo etc.

I have read about people self-medicating before they are able to formally start the process, and I was wondering if any of you who have experience with that can help me:

1. I have heard you need regular blood tests. This is impossible for me right now for various reasons, is it unsafe to do it without them or will it just reduce the effectiveness?

2. Where do I buy hormone treatments and how much do they typically cost? And also what do I get?

3. Any other tips

I really want to do this now, I have been thinking about it a lot and it's very important for me that I stop putting this off as soon as possible. Thanks guys!

z33r0,asktransgender,Online dating with respect to trans status,"Hi there. I am trying to determine some of the populations that are overlooked when an app is designed, and am especially interested in dating sites. I was going to research how women are harassed on dating sites, and it got me to wondering whether trans people specifically were also ever harassed on the basis of being trans (obviously trans women who are read as women are going to receive the same harassment that all women do). I can't seem to find much information on this through google, and at this point it has become something I am curious about in its own right. So I thought I would ask for your experiences. For those of you who have or have had online dating sites where you indicate your status as trans women or trans men, do you receive what you would consider to be harassing messages or conversations that become abusive very quickly on the basis of being trans? I am very interested to hear your experiences in as much detail as you care to provide, but I understand that dating can be a frustrating and difficult endeavour for trans people in general and that talking about it may trigger dysphoria so please keep your own well being in mind when contributing. Please include what your gender designation is on the profile you have/had, what the website is (if you are comfortable with that, it's not necessary), and the content or nature of the messages you received, as well as your personal feelings about it, plus anything else you care to include. For the purpose of my question I am interested especially in those who disclose their status as trans women or trans men right on their profiles before any messages are exchanged. I am also very much interested in what the failings of contemporary dating sites might be for trans men and trans women. What are some ways in which you feel your needs are overlooked as users? Also, I am not sure if this qualifies as a questionnaire exactly and I apologize if it is viewed that way, I didn't think of it that way since it is not for the purpose of collecting data for a study, it's more something I wanted to learn more about to better understand different types of people and what they deal with on a day to day basis. I hope I have adhered to the guidelines correctly. Thanks for your time!"

So as a result of my lovely lovely job, I get to spend three months meeting with various people throughout China, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

ThrowawayPlatypuses,asktransgender,Is FtM transition really worth it?,"Sorry for throwaway account.
Now first off I have no intention of offending anyone here and I have great respect for everyone who isn't afraid of being themself. I have seem a couple of great FtM timelines, but most of those were of people who were already less feminine and relatively tall. 

I am female and have always hated hated myself for it. My body is VERY feminine, with large hips and I'm also quite short (160cm). There is absolutely no way to look good in men's clothes so I just try to accept my gender and dress ""normal"". I'm hoping that I'll be able to look beyond genders some day, but I'm not sure. I've been like this since I was a child and have always dreamt of being a guy. 

People close to me accept me this way but they don't think transitioning would make me happier, especially if I were unattractive and short. I can't say I disagree with them. As an ugly woman I can hide myself with make up at least.
So what do you guys think? Is there anyone with similar experience here? "
jogylivesforever,asktransgender,Meeting long lost friend who has transitioned MTF,"Ok, everyone, I contacted a long lost friend recently. Someone from college and we had lost contact for 15 years. We always had a lot of fun together when we were together. So I wanted to get together with him. Since we last saw each other I have come out of the closet and am a lesbian. He has transitioned from MTF. When I talked on the phone to her she was so serious and while I understand it's difficult to come out of the closet I just want to have a good time with her when we go out and don't want any heavy conversations. I keep on feeling that she wants me to accept her the way she is now because she is trans, but quite frankly I don't know if I will even like her anymore because she is so serious about everything. And she sounds sexist to me. I asked her if she would help me hook up a new TV I have had for 2 years and she said that's a boys job. What do I do. We always had so much fun together but I'm not sure I would even like her anymore. I feel like it a shame, but we are going to see each other again after 15 years and I want to have a good time like we always did but I have this feeling that she is a different person now. How can someone say that they knew from childhood that they were really a girl and then change there personality and fun loving nature after they transition. 
Sorry for rambling on but I don't want to hurt anyone's feeling ever.

Songus,asktransgender,How do I make sense of myself? NSFW,"Hi I'm a 22 year old guy(?). A few months ago I cam across this subreddit and ever since then I have been questioning my gender. I'm not a fan of big long paragraphs of writing so I'm going to list all the things that have me confused. Please let me know if anything I write has a clue to who I am.

* I have been into trans and forced fem porn for a while, long before I started questioning my gender. Over time I found it more exciting to identify as the transgirl than as the guy.
* When I'm clothes shopping I feel a deep longing to try on the girls clothes. They just seem so much more exciting to me. However whenever I've tried crossdressing I've found it unpleasant and I just feel like a guy in girls clothes. 
* I only really question my gender whenever I'm tired or lonely. When I feel good I like being a man and the idea of being a woman seems absurd.
* I've always been anxious and depressed and constantly worried about the future. I've read here that some transgirls on estrogen feel happier and less anxious because of it, I don't know if this wil work for me, but it does sound appealing. 
* I love looking at trans timelines, I find them fascinating, but I'd struggle to give a clear answer as to why.
* Whenever I imagine living my life as a girl it seems ok, but I think it's mostly because I like the idea of wearing girls clothes, I'm not so sure I'd like being treated as a woman by other people.

There's more stuff but I can't remember it all now. Why is gender such a difficult concept?

BaileyTheWhitesican,asktransgender,How do I stop being distracted?,"Hi

So lately, well not just lately but lately it's been getting worse and worse, I haven't been able to focus as much especially in class. I sit down in the front and even still keep getting dysphoric distracting thoughts, or I get distracted by my body, by people's stares, by anything really

Usually for years I've been able to do well despite this, but over time it's been getting worse and especially now that I'm in college. I'm pre-everything and it's looking to stay that way anywhere from a decade to forever really. Can't get by in any class without constantly being distracted and even then I have trouble retaining any of it because i could stay focused. If this continues, it's extremely likely that i won't graduate, and I don't know what to do about it to fix this. Already falling behind, likely/certain that I'll lose a lot of the financial aid I get to even stay in this place.

Yarodia,asktransgender,Anyone get t-blocker as an injection?,"Hi, I've been on 5mg Finasteride daily and 100mcg Estradiol patch twice weekly for just over 8 months. I recently had a GIC appointment and they are upping Estradiol to 200mcg twice weekly and switching the Finasteride for a monthly injection (changing to the monthly if all goes well after that). I'm hoping this will accelerate the changes I have seen so far and get my levels more in range. I'm seeing my doctor next week to discuss the change over but at this point I don't even know what the new medication is called in order to research it myself.

Has anyone had experience of changing to injections for blocking testosterone. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything worth knowing, like did it affect your mood, did you notice any distinct changes vs other methods, and where do they actually administer the injection on the body?"

gr33d0l,asktransgender,"Growing older, clinging to lost time.","I am facing some sort of an existential crisis right now. As someone approaching their mid 30s, I'm not considered young but certainly terribly old either. 

Throughout my entire life, I've always been afraid of growing older, even as a child. Just simply knowing that being older meant more responsibilities and duties pushed onto you was enough to scare me away.

Compounded with being transgender. It just makes it so much more worse, especially with my envy and desperation to make up for lost time. Just throwing out a personal anecdote, my particular obsession with school uniforms. 

During my teenage years, I began to slowly become aware of how I felt about my gender and I've always dealt with a terrible jealousy about never having the chance to live my life how I wanted during those crucial years of my youth. 

Seeing the girls in my high school, I wanted their lives. I wanted to wear that uniform, be able to go to school and grow up and learning about the world how I wanted it and most importantly of all, being able to look forward to the prime of their lives.

And I think that means a lot, just being able to grow up being yourself. Now I'm just being a creep being secretly envious of looking at younger women, thinking about all the things they could do and look forward to.

The reality wasn't quite the same, unsurprisingly. I loved this silly idealized fantasy of mine because the real thing was just depressing, filled with doubt, self-harm and bullying. And what did I make of my life after that? My early twenties and university years, spent languishing and doing fuck all. It saddens me that I barely have anything worth remembering. There wasn't anything good or bad, there was just nothing. As if four years had just gone by and left without a trace, it makes me feel so hollow and how I've wasted all of it.

I won't ever have the innocence someone learning how the world works. Bad things have happened and I'm the wiser for it, but in a sense I feel that I've been tainted by it. I'm supposed to be restarting my life with my new gender, but it's only a fantasy to think that I can just start over from a blank slate. I'll be getting older and all I have is baggage from before.

I'm not a kid anymore. There's no point pretending or even deluding myself. What gone is forever gone and there is nothing I can do. I won't be getting any younger.

Life is kind of unfair in some regard, we live to our seventies or eighties but yet we spend most of it being old than young. The few years that we have being young is just so fleeting, a small speck in most people's lives.

There is really no point clinging onto this. What is gone will be gone, if I don't start making a life out of what I have now, I'll see you guys in the next few years with the second edition of how I fucked up my life even more.

The name I would love to go by in girl mode is quite different than my current (birth name).

michellefox0220,asktransgender,Has anyone else (MTF) experienced a more feminine voice pitch on HRT?,"To give you some context, I am 50ish and have been on a lower dose of HRT (2mg estrodial 2x a day and 50mg of spiro 2x a day) since November. Even before I started HRT I would *occasionally* be misgendered over the phone. Yesterday I was speaking on the phone and I felt like me voice had changed.  It was really weird.  I had a hard time speaking in a lower pitch.

So, I fired up an app that I had on my phone when months ago, I was going to work on changing the pitch of my voice to sound more feminine.  The name of the app is Voice Pitch Analyzer.  Last summer with all my efforts I could barely break into the female range.  It was a strain and felt very forced and unnatural.

Yesterday, the results were that the lowest was in the Androgynous Range, but the average was in the female range.  I was shocked at the result. You can see the chart here: [http://imgur.com/a/CIrzw] (http://imgur.com/a/CIrzw)

I'm concerned that testosterone is still damaging my body, and will continue to do so for the next few months until I either get a dosage increase, or my levels finally even out.

She's one of my strongest supporters, and it would be unfair not to say she's like my conscience, too.

Anyway, so a buddy of hers and mine came back to town from the rigs yesterday, and he took us out to the titty bar. Before getting there I had told him that I'm trans, just so it wouldn't come out at the club and get all awkward and shitty, as these things have a way of doing just that when involving me. And like I anticipated, it totally did come out in conversation, which is when I started hella picking up vibes from my buddy's friend. This was confusing in and of itself, for the simple fact that I wouldn't have called him for it. But like the more we bullshitted and flirted, my gaydar started going fucking NUTS. I mean, by the end of things he's talking about watching me and our other male buddy fuck, providing lubrication from his own mouth, etc. Like super vulgar but that's roughneck culture and style, you know? I've been around that shit all my life, so it doesn't really bother me at all.
So at the end of the night, I couldn't hang anymore and I asked him if he was 100% straight, just running based in the vibes. And he basically told me that he doesn't know, he's never been with a male. He mentioned his daughter, and then said ""But you never knew what can happen"" and then almost immediately started making plans with it other friends to go shooting this morning, and it wasn't even a thing. So I went off to go come to terms with getting shut down, and then we all left. And all of us ended up at the same fast food joint to satisfy our drunken munchies. He and I sat next to each other, he shared his plate with me, we flirted some more. A lot more.
And then literally that was it. I couldn't go shooting with them as I'm a felon, and probably for the better anyways... I've been so so sick all day. Haven't seen this guy again, and I've no clue if I will again. 
I just can't figure out what the actual fuck he meant."

ifoundathrowawayname,asktransgender,[UK] Is anyone familiar with the NHS protocol,"tl;dr: Can you change your nominated surgeon?

---

Later this week, *someone* has an appointment coming up. It's a phone appointment, and from my own experience, they're basically used for discharging you, because they know there's nothing you can do to contest it - if you do anything at all they just cowardly hang up rather than hear you out.


So, this certain someone, had two opinion letters, and was up to the stage of being referred for surgery. Then she moved in with someone who was post-op through the same surgeon.


She now wants to backtrack. She no longer wants surgery through Phil Thomas after having seen his work first hand (better than anything you can read on the Internet), and now wishes to go to Thailand instead.


A few months ago, her GIC told her this was impossible. Her choices were now Thomas or just discharge altogether. They gave her a few months to make her mind up, and that time's almost up. I've only just now found out about this.


Are they allowed to do that? A choice akin to:

&gt; We can't re-write your letter to (x/y/z Thai surgeon) now. You can't change your surgeon once we've written the letter.


How long does it take to edit the letter they've typed? Couple of minutes - and that's for a slow typist.

---

I don't want to see her get discharged with nothing at this late stage, especially since I'm due for my own first and second opinions imminently. I've told the exact same GIC that I want my letters addressed to Dr Chettawut, and they seemed OK with that.


Why do I seem to be allowed to take my letters to Thailand when someone else at the same GIC isn't?


Personally I think her best bet is to turn up in person anyway and start demanding to see the clinician she's supposed to be having a telephone appointment with. I'm half tempted to drag her down there myself, and possibly go in with her as well (unless she doesn't want me to). It sounds like we might have to fight for this, and that's something where having backup always helps.


Before we do though, it'll really help if anyone knows for sure if we can actually do this."

1. It suppresses Gonadotropins resulting in reduced T levels.
2. It is the most potent natural 5 alpha reductase inhibitor  that blocks the conversion of T to DHT.(Does Progesterone SR will help in sustained blocking of the T to DHT conversion?)

Serraofthesea,asktransgender,An Honest Coming Out Letter,"Hey Mum and Dad.  

Let me start off by saying that I love you both so much.  You have always shown me love and support through the years.  I thank and appreciate you for that everyday.  

Dad, if there has been one thing you've said that has stuck with me, it would be that ""you may not always like the decisions your children make but you will always love and support us"".  I hope that this statement stays true today and forever.  What I am about to tell you may not be popular to you, but they are very much the right decisions for me based on years of retrospective analysis and personal reflection.

This topic may be hard to talk about but I hope that you love and respect me for finally having the courage to share with you the feelings that I have been struggling with for most of my life. 

I have been quietly living with depression since elementary school and have on occasion thought of suicide as the only cure for the pain. I have only recently begun to put the pieces together to realize what is causing this depression.  It scares me to think of how easy it would be to end my life and make the pain go away forever.

For the past few years I have been in a state of self reflection.  I have been piecing together thoughts, feelings and memories throughout my life and have revealed a clear unremitting truth.  A truth that I have known about myself on some level since I was young.  The gender that I was assigned at birth has always felt ill-fitting and burdensome.    

I have come to finally admit to myself that I am a transgender person.   It has taken me over 10 years to finally come to understand who I am, how ever, I have always known to some degree.  My desire is to be able to be the woman that I am and to live the rest of my life as such.  To be called by she and her pronouns and to be accepted as your daughter.

When I look in the mirror, I am confused and upset at the physical traits that I see.  This is known as gender dysphoria.  I do not have thoughts of wanting muscles or broad shoulders.  Instead I wonder how I can get larger and more visible breasts, softer features and less body hair.  I have been struggling with dysphoria for years without knowing why or what is causing it.  Dysphoria is the cause of my depression and is one of the determining factors in my decision to transition.  Transitioning is the cure for dysphoria and eventually my depression.

Transition means taking steps towards changing my body so others see me as I see myself.  It means eventually getting to a point of being able to live as a woman full time.  To do this, I will be seeing a Gender Therapist and have found a doctor to help me start Hormone Replacement Therapy.  HRT will start to change my body to reflect feminine characteristics.  Just like at puberty, the fat in my body will redistribute in a more female pattern.  Breasts will start to grow, muscle tone will decrease and my features will get softer.  These are all changes that I will embrace completely.  

Now is the time I change my life for the better.

Although I have done a poor job of keeping in contact with you over the years, I do desire to have a close relationship with you both.  I would prefer to include you in my life and transition instead of doing this behind your backs.  I have already spoken with (brother) who has assured me that his relationship with me will only grow stronger.  All I ask is that you continue to love and support me as I take the next steps in my transition.  Your response will determine the course of our relationship.  If you have questions, as I suspect you will, please ask me.  

Eventually going forward, I will expect to be called by my new name and preferred pronouns.  This will be the biggest struggle for you as you have only ever known me as your son.  Please try to understand that gender and assigned sex are not one in the same and although on the outside I look male I am female in my heart and always have been.    

My name is Serra Dawn, and I am your daughter.

CrossfireInvader,asktransgender,"I can't get the care I need without outing myself to my family. Even if I did, I'm not sure I could do it. Depressed and suicidal. How do I get through this?","To begin, I'm 22 years old, AMAB, and I've been struggling with the idea of being MTF for over a year and a half (specifically since summer of 2015). At first, I thought I might just be interested in crossdressing as I'd never really entertained the idea of being anything other than male, but as I allowed my thoughts to wander, the idea that there might be something more to this rang louder and louder in my mind. 

After struggling with the urge to crossdress for a month or two, I confided in some friends of mine while visited them out of state. They were incredibly open-minded and supportive. I felt relieved that they saw it as no big deal, yet I beat myself up for not telling my girlfriend of several years first. I was too terrified of her reaction to approach her and needed a practice round. As much for my sake as for hers, I promised my friends that I would come out to my girlfriend when I got home.

Months passed, and I still hadn't said anything. Finally, one of my friends sent my girlfriend a message to the effect of ""CrossfireInvader has something important that he needs to tell you,"" and thus I stumbled through the long-dreaded conversation. She was actually relieved to hear the truth, as her mind had instantly jumped to some very dark conclusions. The next morning, however, she performed a complete reversal in attitude and started begging me not to do it. The thought of seeing me as a female, even in the most temporary of ways, was just too much for her. This continued for a month or two until I finally agreed to put it all away for the sake of our relationship.

As I'm sure many of you know, things never work that way. The feeling came back quickly and more intensely than ever before. I checked out some of the trans-related subs here on Reddit, and my first reaction was quiet jealousy. The implications were obvious, and I started attending my university's LGBT support group. My girlfriend knew that I attended the group (plenty of straight and cis people do), but I kept my feelings quiet.

The new year came and went, and my confusion turned to depression. I felt trapped, desperately in need of answers but without any idea as to where I might get them. Sometimes I felt so confident that I was trans, but sometimes I simply couldn't fathom the idea. I still hadn't told my girlfriend anything. Eventually, my depression became so severe that it impeded my ability to function in daily life. My mother came to visit me at my apartment one afternoon, and I broke down sobbing in her arms begging her to promise me that she would always love me. Being the helicopter parent that she is, she dug around on Facebook to find that I was a member of the LGBT support group's Facebook group and confronted me. Being a conservative Christian raised in the rural Bible belt, she was not particularly thrilled with all of this. Eventually, I agreed to see a counselor (though not the religious counseling she pushed me towards).

It felt nice to get some of my feelings out, but I'm not sure how ready I was to actually put a label on anything. That feeling was odd, really, considering that I went to my university's LGBT prom in a dress and makeup and LOVED every second of it. While my mother knew why I was in counseling, I told my girlfriend that I was simply going to address my depression and anxiety (which was true but certainly not the complete picture).

And then... it stopped. Sort of.

Upon graduating in the spring, I took an internship in another state. I'd wanted to leave my hometown and break into that particular industry for quite some time, and this internship handed me those opportunities on a silver platter. I had a great job, a great apartment, a great neighborhood, plenty of money, and a bright future. My trans feelings moved to the back burner for a while, though they certainly didn't disappear. At times, I'd wonder how much better I'd feel sitting in a meeting in a dress instead of slacks and a collared shirt or working at my desk in something cute and girly without a care in the world. But for the most part, I was happy. It was certainly the best period of my life in recent memory.

So of course it ended. I was unable to get a full-time job at the company and moved back home so I'd have a place to stay while I looked for work. This was August of 2016. It's now February of 2017, and I've made almost no progress.

Over the last six months, I've grown weary and hopeless. My weight and BMI have officially crossed the threshold into ""overweight."" And recently my trans thoughts have returned with a vengeance.

Now my girlfriend (who STILL thinks I left this all behind in October of 2015) just got a full-time job. She wants to move in together and really get our life started. At the same time, she's angry with me because I've basically moped through the process. I should be happy for her, but this means that I have to do something. I have to either act on my feelings or put them to bed for good.

I don't know what to do. I obviously need to see a counselor again, but if I do that, I'm afraid that my parents will immediately know why. I can't face them again. I can't handle the angry phone calls and the assertions that ""you're making a huge mistake."" And I can't break my girlfriend's heart like this. I feel awful for ruining this happy moment, but I'll feel worse if I essentially force her to break up with me. And beyond all that, can I be happy? It seems that my trans feelings are strongest when I'm most unsure of myself. Are they simply an outcropping of my self-doubt?

I can't handle this anymore. I'm done torturing myself just so I can go on torturing other people. I've never felt more worthless or undeserving of the air I suck. I'm just so tired of living. I've already started formulating plans to kill myself, but I don't have a timeline in mind and I'd probably be too scared to follow through. Still, death sounds better than this awful life I've let myself slip into. What am I supposed to do?

**TL;DR: Low-key came out to my girlfriend and parents in the past, and they reacted horribly. I need to figure out my feelings with a counselor but can't figure out how to do that without tipping my hand.**

I have looked at this picture a lot and I concluded that I don't want as much surgery as I thought I did, if I only get my jaw done it will be so proportional and good. I told 2 of my friends this and showed them the picture and both of their responses were:

1) God, you're so fishy. I don't see what you're saying at all but I understand that's how you feel
2) Are you kidding me? all I see is a proportional, beautiful face. 

My friends are sweet but it got me thinking and like questioning reality a little bit because it makes me doubt what I see in the mirror, you know? Like how does dysphoria actually work? Is it an actual distortion like a funhouse mirror? are we looking at the same picture but seeing different people? it's so confusing to me! 

I have suffered from eating disorders in the past so I understand somewhat the distortion (i.e. feeling disgusting and fat while 30 pounds underweight)

astonesthrowawy,asktransgender,Can internalized homophobia push someone to transition?,"I was pretty feminine when I younger. I tried to hide it, but it was show unintentionally sometimes. Some people thought I was gay including my parents. 

But slowly discovered I had bisexual leanings starting around 12-13. But before that when I crossdressed in private, I was a straight girl and when I didn't I was a straight boy. It took me a long time to accept till I accidentally outed myself by saying in class that I would date a guy who looked like the opposite gender or later on say how a guy who presented in class was attractive. 

I can't help but think back to the session I had with my psychologist that I would rather be seen as a girl than gay.

tempest_wing,asktransgender,Question: Is Being Transgender a Choice?,"I understand the concept of being transgender. Someone that identifies as one gender that isn't the one they were assigned at birth. But, there's a conundrum that pops up in my head when that happens. 

Assuming being transgender IS a choice, and let's for example say Janelle decides to now identify as John. It can be argued that John, now identifies as John and not Janelle. That was a conscious decision he made to identify as John now instead of Janelle. John identified as Janelle, but now identifies as John. Therefore a choice. However, It can also be argued that John was always John and NOT Janelle and therefore did not make a choice to identify as John instead of Janelle. In regards to this second argument, it'd be like someone having a nickname. The nickname doesn't define the person. John was always John regardless if he was called Janelle, Heather or Bob. It doesn't matter if his parents named him Janelle or if his birth certificate names him as Janelle. John is John regardless since this is how he identifies himself. His own self. His own state of being.

I have no right to say which one is correct and which one isn't, since I'm not transgender, so as transgender individuals, which argument is the correct one? Am I overthinking this?"

I provided a letter from my psychiatrist and surgeon on the original request. My psychiatrist is involved in the committee that works on the wpath standards and is very reputable. My surgeon is Deschamps-Braly.

It was denied due to an exclusion that says it's not medically necessary. I and my doctor's disagree. I plan on adding letters from my general psychiatrist and primary care provider, the latter of which also specializes in transgender care. My insurance is a PPO so I'm going ahead regardless, and will still be able to fight it.

I'm not sure I can afford a good attorney, but I can have one write a letter at least. Has anyone with an anthem PPO gotten approval? I'm in California and a resident of San Francisco, so the hope is if it goes to the state board of insurance my chances will be better, but I'd like to do everything in my power to ensure my case is solid. My name and gender have been legally updated, and I can also likely provide sworn affidavits from my company essentially confirming severe gender dysphoria if it would help.

Should I also provide my own statement? What else can I do? Are there previous cases I can reference? I'm only aware of ones on managed medi-cal which I don't think would help.

I'm also considering making a more public facing site to serve as a way to view progress of the fight as well as show everything I've learned and am learning and let others add to it. In this precarious time we live in this is a fight I want to take on and if nothing else help with education, but ideally help move the needle forward.

Any and all resources and suggestions are welcome! 

Many thanks for any help,

Hellowhstami,asktransgender,Very confused,"I was questioning for a month or so after having feelings of wanting to be a girl, but then they stopped for a little while. Then just today I saw a timeline and felt like this longing to be a girl again. I'm not exactly why it stopped the first time, but it was like gone completly, but I still liked tg captions and stuff, just didn't put myself into their place as much. I happened to get really close to a girl around this time then just had that end a week ago or so so maybe that's it? "
pesh527,asktransgender,I'm asking for some insight into the issues with my brother (FtM),"Some back ground on my brother:

He's 14, and has a lot of medical issues. ADHD, PCOS, Borderline Personality Disorder, insulin resistance, obesity (probably has a binge eating disorder too), anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, a history of self harm, and 7 hospitalizations in the past 2 years from the self harm and suicidal thoughts. After the first hospitalization or so, he came out to the family as identifying as transgender (FtM). It was a shock for us, and came out of left field. No matter, we have accepted it and supported him where possible with the gender dysphoria. Even his therapist says we are one of the most supportive families he's seen. My parents allow him to go by a male name, wear men's clothing, get him male shower products, and redecorated his room to be less feminine. We didn't think it was a good idea for him to express as male in school due to potential backlash from his peers. Even so, he was strong willed about doing so, and we allow him to do so. To clarify- of course we don't have to give permission for him to be himself, but what I mean is that we aren't sabotaging his efforts to be male. He does not like talking about his feeling or what's going on, so its hard to help him. He's in therapy and all the professionals related to his care agree that he needs a long term residential treatment program for the mental health issues.


Yesterday, my mom called him up at the hospital. He was very upset and carried on about wanting HRT. He admitted that he knows he wont get it until he is psychological stable. He has a history of manipulative behaviors and now my mom is worried that he will fake being well in order to get hormones. 


She is hesitant to 100% accept that he is actually transgender due to the shifting sense of self that is common with borderline personality disorder (she doesn't tell him that though), and the fact that he is only 14. To add to my mom's doubt, my brother still enjoys make up and wore a dress to a school 
dance last year (but does make up have to be female only? I think not. it's society's expectation that makeup is feminine). So of course my mom thinks HRT is a bad idea.


My first concern upon hearing about his desire for HRT was the PCOS. He has quite a bad case of it. Multiple cysts (one burst last year), irregular periods, heavy periods, insulin resistance, and obesity. He's being treated with birth control pills and Metformin, which help tremendously with the cysts and pain, insulin resistance, and heavy bleeding. Is it even possible to do HRT if you're taking birth control for PCOS? I'm sure HRT is tricky enough with PCOS as it is. 


So my basic questions are/ TL;DR:

1. Is it wrong to question moving forward with HRT based on the history of mental illness, specifically the borderline personality disorder?
2. Is it possible to do HRT (FtM) when there's an underlying hormonal disorder that's being treated with female hormones?
3. Any specific advice on how to support someone who is transgender and has suicidal thoughts?"
Frittenkitten234,asktransgender,How do I [FtM] deal with my girlfriend[MtF] who is becoming super narcissistic and not in a good way?,"I was going to post this in the relationship Reddit, but I've been told they don't take kindly to trans folk and I don't think I could handle abuse or mockery right now. :S :S 

I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate, I'll delete if it isn't.

I have a girlfriend who is also trans (She is MtF, I am FtM) and ever since she came out and begun physically transitioning, she's become really bitchy and narcissistic. I'm all for loving yourself, lord knows I wish I could, and I totally understand that now she's transitioning, she's more confident and more happy, so it's understandable that she's now liking/loving herself more. But she constantly rubs things in my face all the time and is really conceited about it. Everything we talk about becomes a competition and she always talks down to me like I'm beneath her. 

We live about two hours apart, and we don't see each other very often, but keep in contact via calls, Skpe, texts, etc. She's got a really busy social life so she doesn't want me to come visit or to come visit me, only when she permits it. Any other time and she's simply not interested. It's either met with a flat out refusal or a 'We'll see.' and then she never says yes.

I sadly lost my job when I came out (Which I tried to take further but the manager just denied it completely and the business was a family owned one, so only small so no one would listen to me when I tried to take it further.), and jobs in my town in the UK are very rare, because it's so small. As such, I'm really struggling financially, and most of the money I do get, goes to buying train tickets to travel to the city to job hunt. 

My girlfriend constantly talks about how everyone is attracted to her, how much money she has, how good looking she is, how she's got the best life and how she can spend her money on anything she likes, because her parents charge her no rent what so ever. I'm constantly bombarded by links over expensive items she's bought and texts over how sexy she thinks she is. I agreed at the start, because I think she's beautiful, but it's now a constant barrage. I've asked her nicely if we can change the subject and talk less about money, because I'm really struggling financially, but she still goes on about it.

She also knows I'm having some real issues transitioning, because my doctor wont give me the testosterone half the time, so I have to chase it up through all these channels to get it, as well as a multitude of other issues and wait times. Mean while, she constantly talks about how easy it is for her, but then in the same breath tells me I'm a man and wouldn't understand how hard it is for her and that my life is easy because I'll have 'male privilege' when I finally pass. (Right now I don't pass at all, even after a year on T, am constantly misgendered and my own family wont even call me the right name or pronouns and she knows this.)

I dunno if it's taking estrogen which is perhaps affecting her personality? (Please note, I am definitely not saying anyone who takes estrogen is mean, bitchy or narcissistic! I'm asking if estrogen could make my GF like this, as in mood swings and shifts? Since T can give us lot using it mood swings. Like for me, it's made me a lot more laid back, but my friend has become more aggressive.) but it's really not a good change. She's become super uncaring unless it affects her. Some of her comments are down right mean about other people, saying she's above others and that she's no time to listen to morons talk about things she's not interested in, when I bring up certain topics. She'll dismiss hoards of people as stupid because they like something she dislikes and says some really cruel things, like 'Trans men are morons. Why would any of them want to get pregnant?' and the like and it's just not pretty.

I was incredibly distressed today because I've been told the waiting list for top surgery in my country is over a year just to get an appointment with a surgeon and then you need to add on however long the wait is for the actual surgery date and when I told her how I was struggling to handle this, she changed the topic onto how unfair it was that she needed to wait 4 months for her private surgeon for breast augmentation and was completely uncaring. She then said 'What do you want me to do about it?' and when I said 'I don't want you to do anything about it hon', I got 'Then there's nothing more for me to say on this topic. BTW look at my new makeup I bought!'

'I just wanted you to listen was all, like how I listen to you.' And she replied with 'Whatever.'

Is this...a normal change on estrogen? I've not heard of people getting such dramatic mood shifts, but it just seems extreme and I'm unsure where to even go from here? If changes like this are normal, do they settle down at all? Right now it's so bad I'm considering breaking up with her. I love her, but I can't handle how she's acting. :S

hiyapplz,asktransgender,Come on Texas/Tri-care,So a few days ago when I went to therapist we figured out that she couldn't diagnose me through tri care with gender dismorphia due to me being a minor.

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,Anyone else on their fifth month of hormones? (I'm mtf),"Edit: I formatted this to be a list but for some reason it didn't work

In my five months I now have:

1. A different body odor
2. Breast buds that have still not eclipsed moob territory
3. A lot less greasy face (though it is ""winter"")
4. No vellus hair yet but most body hair is immensely finer
5. No morning wood
6. Immensely lowered libido (Im hoping for a rebound soon)
7. A slightly softer complexion
8. It's hard to tell but I THINK I'm losing hair at a slower rate, judging by the last few times I washed it
9. My nipples are a lot more sensitive and they can hurt
10. My nipples secrete a clear liquid when squeezed though I have since learned to not do that anymore
11. Clear ejaculate  (at least it was a few days ago)
12. An increasingly positive body image, I'm finding it easier to see the good things instead of the bad things
13. A slightly increased self-esteem (but have not socially transitioned yet)

Things I have NOT experienced are:

1. Lessened level of emotions, I unfortunately still have that tendency to not cry
2. An immense craving for salty stuff
3. Any noticeable fat redistribution 
4. Any sense of hormone-induced gender euphoria where I suddenly see the world in different colors or whatever
5. No sense of calm that many talk about
6. No change in sensations during private time besides the nipples, but I am conciously looking for any new erogenous zones
7. No decrease in muscle mass that is noticeable
8. Any sort of ""pelvic tilt""

I still have a long way to go. My transition has been kinda weird where life has come first the last few months and the HRT is just a side thing. It's kinda weird how less focused I am about transitioning while the hormones do their thing.

Any other people at 5 months wanna share?"
neurophilos,asktransgender,Letter of support frustrations,"I understand why a letter of support is part of the current system. I understand why my therapist needs to ask me a bunch of questions to be able to write the letter. But isn't several hours over several months excessive if I'm completely satisfied with transition thus far and already very informed? Frankly I figure my therapist is putting me through this so she can say she followed all the rules, not because she needs to verify that I'm a good candidate for surgery. And I resent being put through hoops so she can be secure in her job, if it delays me finding peace in my life generally. I know that might sound a bit excessive but she is at very low risk of losing her job over writing these letters too quickly, whereas she knows I struggle to keep functioning. \rant."

forlackofabetterusr,asktransgender,I'm having body issues and i dont know if they are entirely related to dysphoria,"Recently i've had some sort of miracle happen; when I present how i normally do (make-up, cute clothes, etc.) I feel actually pretty, confident, and happy!! BUT, when i'm not like that, such as when i have to go to bed, which means taking off my bra and makeup, all those good feelings vanish. I hate to look in a mirror at this time because i feel not feminine, i feel gross, i feel not very attractive. I hate it, i hate these feelings so much, they make me more depressed then i already am in that period. 

It's also weird though, i've noticed that at each landmark, such as wearing a bra full time, or wearing makeup more then just mascara every day, I quickly start to hate how i looked before hand. I just feel like i look so much prettier now that i wear a bra and makeup, but when i'm not able to, i feel gross and not feminine.

I realize that this is internalized crap, but i have no clue how to get over it! I'm incredibly self-conscious and it's hard to feel good about myself. But i really can't keep living like this. I'd probably feel better in the future once i develope more of breasts and get my hair to my ideal length, but what can i do now?

We did that last week, and today we had our offer on a house that I never thought I'd get to live in accepted! Six years ago I was unemployed, depressed, dysphoric, and thinking my life would never be any good. At the end of next month, I'm moving into the house of my dreams, and I'll actually be able to keep eating, too!

My transition is really barely a thing anymore. It's very much in the background now after having dominated my life for so long. I feel great, I had two men flirt with me yesterday despite looking like something the cat dragged in,  and I'm so comfortable in my own skin now.

First of all I must say that i'm a REALLY reserved person and I actually would prefer to do not even say that I'm not single (I'm not ashamed of him, I'm just really effing shy and jealous of my privacy)

I'm rambling sorry

Anyway my problem is that there's pretty good chances that they'll find out that he was born female and I'd prefer to tell them myself rather than having them discover it form other sources.

Any ideas about how I should break the subject?
My biggest fear is that they'll treat him differently and I won't stand for that.

Thank you in advance

So, here's a vomit of all of my feelings. I'm MTF, I've been on HRT for two years and...

Well, I like my body better I think, but I'm terrified of changing it further, even electrolysis freaks me out. Like, so I liked the ladylike frame, what if I'm still wrong? It's so immediate a change, I don't get time to ease into it like with HRT.

And on top of that I was at a support group recently and people told me that I should still feel a heck of a lot better after transitioning, but it feels like my mental state has only improved a tiny bit.

D_sebt,asktransgender,sueing for mis gendering?,"So earlier this week I was asked my friend the following question: ""do you think there will be a time when people who identify as transgender can sue their parents doctor for mis labeling their gender?"" He rebutted with ""no, because they do not identify with their chosen gender until later in life.""  To which I responded (This wasn't verbatim but I'm genuinely wanting to know so I'm adding more of my thought and what my understanding is to hopefully get a better answer.) ""yes but many in the LGBT community say (to quote the great Lady Gaga) they were ""born this way"". ""  Personally I agree with gender being a spectrum due to differing levels of testosterone and estrogen creating a spectrum that you can fall on and scientifically measure. 

So in my mind one could possibly have grounds to take legal action for pain and suffering due to mis-gendering during the pregnancy. I see this as a possibility because while taking a college level business ethics course (I know let's all have a laugh at that contradiction) we were talking about how sexual orientation was not a federally protected class (I'm unaware If that has changed). However we studied a case where a gay man sued his company for firing him based of gender discrimination because he wasn't acting like a man (it's been some years back and I'm a lazy peice of shit so I didn't feel like researching the details but long story short: he sued them because they hired a man but he was acting like a woman so they fired him because he wasn't acting based upon his gender.)

But I've never stopped doubting, mainly because I see myself as a woman, but not a 100%. I'm now getting closer and closer to hormones and I've been doubting myself a lot lately, even though I always have. I know that like dressing feminine and to present as female more, which I already do (minus a feminine voice lol) and being seen as a woman makes me happier. However when I think of myself being sexual (have never had a sexual experience), I think I'm okay with being a female bottom as well as a male bottom (?) and I fear I might feel like I will have missed out on 'male on male' sexual interaction later on, but at the same time I don't want to experience that because I'm afraid a guy would see me as a guy, which I don't want. When I see a cool (trans)girl/-woman I go 'Omg, I want to be like her', because I like expressing myself as feminine more, but I don't dislike my body or genitalia per se (I do have some dysphoria related to body from time to time), although I wouldn't mind having a female body and vagina. I feel like I could be happy having had 'ffs', growing my hair out dress feminine and still have a male body. But at the same time, if I will transition, I want to have srs as well. So to summarize: I feel like I'm trans, but I don't have a lot body dysphoria, I think. Does anybody relate? I almost feel like I'm looking for an excuse to get out of my situation, am I? Any thoughts what I should do? I'm sorry for the random word vomit but I'm kind of lost. 
P.S. Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading!"

waffles271,asktransgender,How do I not end up institutionalized tomorrow at my appointment(depression) How do I keep myself safe tonight?,"I have finally made an appointment to try to deal with all of my serious serious depression issues tomorrow. I've been on hormones for almost a year and lied my ass off for years to intermittent therapists about my depression because they've always told me they're required to call me in if i tell them i'm contemplating suicide. Well I do, almost every day, and I am tired of lying about it. I need help, but I don't want my HRT taken away, and I can't end up in a mental institution. Am I just supposed to passive aggressively use hypothetical situations referring to my depression as someone else's? Am I doomed if i bring this up, and I need to keep suffering? Should i go to an institution? I just need more love and purpose in my life, and im pretty sure that won't have either of those things? Also I really really wanna hurt myself now just thinking about this."
Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,"A lot of people say that they've experienced positive mental changes upon starting HRT. Is that anecdotal, or largely the case?","Why might that be?

I guess I ask because, as I'm sure a lot of you know, starting transition has me incredibly anxious about a lot of things, and I'm not sure if I've felt the positive changes. Then again, maybe I've been overlooking them. Maybe they're dependent on dose?

Lastly, how were you effected positively? Specifically, *what* positive changes occurred?"
Stephanie_B2,asktransgender,Spiro and peeing.,"I was wondering about how everyone says that being on spiro makes them pee a lot.
I'm taking 200mg spironolactone (Aldactone) per day, but strangely I don't feel the need to pee frequently, infact it's pretty much the same as before I started taking spiro. 
So does this mean that spiro isn't working for me? "
ElenasBurner,asktransgender,Been dealing with this for awhile now...,"It’s difficult for me to even type about this in here, and this will likely turn into a long ramble. But I’ve been dealing with this for over to 20 years, maybe even more to be honest. I’ve always felt uncomfortable in my body, especially once I hit around 13 or so. Not too long after turning 16 or so I discovered cross-dressing behind closed doors, as a way to deal with it. At the time it seemed like more like a sexual kink I’d do my thing, and the thoughts would go away at first. I never really could relate to other men, it was almost always impossible to develop meaningful male friendships. It’s like I was incapable of thinking that way. But I always looked at myself, and do believe I am straight when it comes to sexual preference.


It wasn’t until I had moved out, and in my first real relationship I did share what I believed at the time to be a kink. As time went on, I kept trying to do things to make myself feel like the person I saw myself as. To an extent she was supportive of it, or just curious how far I’d take it I don’t really know. She had me dress up somewhat, we went out somewhere but I chickened out. I felt like a tarted up freak for lack of a better word, and couldn’t cross the threshold. But it was never enough, I know I kept making more and more unreasonable demands behind closed doors. We drifted apart, likely the stress of it being too much for her. After it happened I did my first purge, I was 20 at the time maybe and crushingly depressed about everything at the time. But time moved on and I thought I was cured for a bit…


Online purchasing started making things so much easier for me, being behind closed doors and all. I once more repeated the cycle, trying to make myself feel more femme. But failing miserably at even making myself happy with my appearance, there were a few times I came close to going out partially with a more androgynous look on multiple occasion. Incorporating some conservative heels, woman’s jeans, and a blouse I had at the time. I repeated this cycle so many times I couldn’t keep track of it anymore. A few woman came and went in my life, I never came out to them by my general frustration did in poor form. But it was obvious I wasn’t doing this for a sexual thrill anymore, I wanted to feel the way I felt so comfortable at home en femme. 


Usually when it would get particularly bad I could always find a distraction, to bring me back down from actually coming or going out. Computer programming, tinkering with electronics, cars, anything overly complicated would help me keep my feelings suppressed as it would be all engrossing. But it was just that a distraction. Eventually, I met the woman that became my wife. Not sure if it was her general insecurity but she wanted to know anything and everything that turned me on. It came out fairly quickly, and oddly she was okay with it so long as it was just a kink only. And to be honest, most of me truly believed it was just a kink nothing more at the time, I really didn’t want to mislead her. She was and still is the most amazing woman I ever met, 10 years later it hasn’t changed one bit.


Not too long after we met one of her best friends went off the “deep end” so to speak. Started sleeping with men, and came out as wanting to live life as a woman he was military and at the time it’s likely that was what gave him the boot before he publically came out. Eventually joining the service for myself, I found that his story of how he got the boot did not add up at all. My wife again asked me if it was just a kink for me. And at the time life was good, but busy I kept dressing up in mostly closed doors. She’d occasionally had me go to work wearing certain items, it likely helped as we both wear the same shoe size. But like always, it started to become harder and harder for me and I wouldn’t be doing it for a sexual trill on occasions. I worked solo so it was pretty easy to get away with it, but it started to become more and more difficult. I’d look in the mirror and not recognize myself some days, totally disconnected from my feelings. I started asking more, and more it felt wrong.


I broke it off with my wife when I finally joined the military, as I was trying to spare her the heartache of a long distance relationship and my obsessions with wanting to feel like a woman. But as the big day to leave came closer I ended up hooking up with a friend a few times as nothing more than two consenting adults. It turned out we had some similar kinks, but it was strictly a sexual thing. I thought maybe I could finally beat it for good, though physically I don’t match up with the typical type of person you’d picture serving. I was 5’ 4” at a whopping 125lbs when I signed on the line. I’ve always been the petite type, but it was something I always wanted to do before I got too old.


A few months later, said friend came upon my collection of clothes/makeup/bras/etc. She seemed intrigued, but with all the stress I went off the deep-end of things we’d talk about. Eventually, and quickly it became too much. Another purge cycle came and went this time without my input as it was beyond my control. My wife and I did keep in touch, I despised myself for trying to save her from me. Eventually we did get back together, knowing how bad I “needed” to dress up she even sent me some helpful items. I started dressing up behind closed doors, but at very great risk at the time. We got back together, and did the long distance thing for many years. We actually beat the odds, a true rarity amongst a sea of horror stories that I was surrounded by at the time. The years ticked on, and I was able to keep myself distracted enough with my hobbies to keep the feelings suppressed. I once more believed it was nothing more than a kink.


This all changed when we had our first child, suddenly the free time I had to maintain myself and keep those feelings at bay came back with a vengeance. But she didn’t mind me doing whatever behind closed doors once the baby was asleep so long as I kept it away from our child. A more than reasonable request, and for awhile all the dressing up worked, though I don’t think she knows I’d do it almost every night trying to make myself feel like the woman I felt like on the inside. But always never able to accomplish such. A year later it came to a head, when I roleplayed as a woman with someone else doing the same online in regards to a really strange turn-on the two of us had (A form of objectum sexuality, that is best saved for another post). I felt dirty about it, I confessed to my wife. She was shocked about three things:

-Chatting in a “sexual” manner with someone else
-Talking about my sexual turn-ons to a random stranger
-That I was willingly acting out being a woman

She asked yet again, and for the first time I honestly felt like I was being less than honest. I couldn’t quite accept it, but deep down I knew it was true. I lied, I want to live life as a woman not just dress the part. I feel like I lost a part of my soul that day lying to the woman I love so much. I saw a therapist for the first time, but I couldn’t quite come out fully to her though she was immensely easy to talk to.


Another year ticked on, desperately attempting to make time for my hobbies trying to suppress it and move on. But there is no time, between some issues she’s having, the military sending me every which way once/twice a month, and our son needing vastly more attention my interest in said hobbies starts to wane. My desire to live like a woman manifests itself in poor form, I can’t tell her how I feel I suppress it more. I get randomly angry at “dumb” stuff, obsessed with things that don’t need to be obsessed about, and angry yet more when she’d question it. I’d randomly start crying when it came to mind, she’d only really notice then if we were driving somewhere at home I had enough distance to hide it. I feel like at this point she’s blaming herself for my behavior.
I start a new job, hoping the reduced stress will help me get back to what I thought I was supposed to be “normal” it doesn’t work. If anything it now gets worse, as my hobbies are just not the passions I had prior anymore I’m unable to use it as a crutch anymore. I’m blinded with rage towards myself, I feel like I’m on the cusp of another purge cycle. I keep trying to suppress it, and it keeps coming back. Talking about what my wife still believed to be a kink, she mentioned how I always felt ashamed of my “kink” and that I need to accept it as part of myself. I try, and for a day I let go and imagined myself as a woman when we’d go out. I felt a happiness I never had for a long time, but it was the thought of transitioning that ultimately finally brought it on. 


But it was short lived as always, the depression came back I felt once more like an empty shell. I see a new therapist, this one well versed in sexual issues. I can’t recall what I had said exactly, or how it came about, but I blurted out that I’ve believed for a long time that I’m a woman inside awkwardly at some point. I paused for what seemed like an eternity for me, I just finally said it out loud and to someone for the first time. I don’t know why, but it felt so good and yet at the same time terrifying. We talk some more but attempts to meet again are foiled by work and needing to travel. It’s god-awful timing as I really need some guidance, I feel isolated.


Finally after 10 years I come out to my wife, I let her know why I’ve been so angry and depressed. She breaks down crying, I can’t help but do the same. She’s understandably pissed to no end, she thinks I lied to her for over 10 years, she keeps repeating how she wants the husband she married, that I promised it was a kink, she said she doesn’t know what she’d do if I started to transition.  She says she doesn’t plan to leave, but is freaking out. I feel like it’s totally unreasonable to even hint at this to her I’ve never felt more depressed in my life ever. 
I can’t even put this part into coherent words, I’m in tears trying to type this out now. I’ve never felt suicidal in my life until this point; I can’t ask my wife to love someone whom isn’t the man she loves, my child to not have a father figure, my in-laws people (whom I love dearly) to likely disown me (They are devout Christians), and the likely end of my military career or at least severely impact it. I think the only thing stopping me harming myself is that I don’t want our child to grow up without me and force my wife to raise him solo. I love her so dearly, and I hate that I’m doing this to her.


But if I don’t do anything I have to live a lie that is making me beyond miserable, one that will spill over and eventually break her leading to the same situation. Deep down I know I want to start HRT, I want to be the person I’ve always felt I was inside. But doing so would be hurting those I love so much, I feel like she’ll blame herself for this and lose everyone else she knows as well. It's a completely unreasonable sacrifice considering everything else she gave up for me to chase my dreams. I’m trapped, and I have no idea what to do, nor do I have anyone I can talk to as I’m in an unfamiliar location without anyone to open up at the moment. 


Overly long-story short I’m looking to hear from someone whom has gone through a similar situation to see how it played out with a wife/child. I don’t know how to manage this anymore and feel like no matter what I do I’m doomed to be miserable, and make those around me miserable as well. I can't seem to take it anymore.

juliagirl1,asktransgender,doubts again-detransition-possibly not right for me?,"im feeling a lot of shame today in myself and maybe im not trans. I know seeing it written down looks stupid, but i am having so much trouble doing hrt DIY and living with these doubts. Is it worth me stopping HRT? I started growing breasts and i think i like them. the issue is presenting. When  I present as female i feel like i look like a man wearing womens clothes, which is true to most people. I don't know why I thought I was trans, but maybe I'm not? i feel so shitty today posting this here, cause yall have helped me a lot with figuring shit out. The issue for me is that I still can't see myself as a woman in my head, I still feel embarrassed when I present more femininely (even though i dont want to be embarrassed), and I am very bad at socializing with other women. like when i talk to women I feel like a man. its shitty, but its how it is. its only when I'm alone that im able to convince myself im a girl. how is it that i could like the HRT changes? im sad that i came out."
SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Ideas to cope with a hostile environment?,"So I had the bright idea of coming out to my dad and now this house has tension so thick you can cut it. My dad hasn't outright said anything beyond the initial conversation, but its clear he doesn't want me in the same room. He has a lot on his plate so I'm hoping he just needs time, but that doesn't help me now. He is also home most of the day.

Outside of sleeping and making myself scarce for school/work I have no relief for the tension. I need to stay here until late April, so I need something to help me cope while I'm home. Anything. I can't focus on any of my usual hobbies and I keep my school work at school due to the nonfocusing thing."
FILE13reddit,asktransgender,"Just an update, feedback encouraged","Currently, i am AMAB, pre everything and non transitioning. I came here a couple months ago, because i was/am questioning wether or not i am trans, or just a crossdresser or have a weird fetish... Fast forword, i talked to my SO about everything, i told her about my cross dressing and wanted to be more effeminate in the past, how a lot of the time being male doesn't bother me, but if i could take that magic pill and wake up female, would i.. Yea. I would definitely consider it. Well, she did not approve, and got a little freaked out, i told her not to worry about it, forget i said anything and it wouldn't come up again. Again, this was all 2 -3 months ago. I have dressed up all of one time, while she was at work i wore one of her dresses, i work out a lot more, trying to emphasize my male ness, my muscles are more defined, shoulders broader, legs bigger, i still identify as male... and I'm ok with it... I still look at women and think about i wish i could wear that, or i wish i would have her hair or her breasts, legs, etc. And i seem to have developed a healthy fetish towards futanari hentai and transwomen.... So here i am questioning what is wrong with me? Am i trans? I thought i was handling not being trans or not continuing down that path pretty well? Idk maybe i just managed to find an outlet and an unhealthy porn habit. I feel like i should note that i too get aroused wearing women's clothes, if that is important or indicative of being trans or not being trans. I apologize for this being so long winded and more of a ramble than a question, thoughts and feedback appreciated. Thank you."

jp7147,asktransgender,Need advice on transition; [28m],"Sorry if this the wrong area for this.  I'm going to just keep it as brief as I can by bullet-ing my current situation and problem.

*Live alone - in new(ish) relationship
*18 months clean from Heroin - started using I would say mostly due to feeling trapped in life
*Back and forth with transitioning or not since I can remember
*Have been CDing since I can remember, since I was able to speak I was into princesses and all sorts of stuff, my dad used to be pissed at my mom for letting me play with that kinda stuff.
*Work at a call center making decent money, know almost nobody in state I live, financially independent, 28 years old. 

*Problem*
I want to transition, but my self confidence and projecting into the future (not being passable, I'm a hairy ass 210lb italian) and the worry that it will cause more problems than its worth. Most days I can get by just BS-ing online to occupy myself, but I went through a period I dressed only in female clothes for a week and I felt amazing even though I didn't really leave the house. I live alone now so I can buy clothes and have them around, but I am just feeling so unfulfilled. I used to think it was money but it always comes back to this issue of transitioning and I always flirt with the idea, but then convince myself something else is the answer, gym, girls, movies, money etc.

I need advice. I -know- I'm trans, but I'm not miserable, just feel like I might not reach my end game if I don't transition. I don't talk to much of my family because of the damage I did with drugs, so I don't think this would bother the ones I have left (probably would explain it to them actually), and I have some supplemental income, like an extra 120-200 a week I can spend. 

I know I'm rambling, but I'm at a weird point where I have all my needs met, but still think about this constantly. I don't know where to start I'm in rural North Carolina. I need some feedback, advice, guidance, anything. I would love to have a mentor eventually, I literally know NOBODY in NC. Coming out wouldn't even bother me to be honest I could give a fuck what anyone thinks, drugs humbled me, I'm just concerned it wouldn't go well aesthetically and where I live I know myself and would dress as a male in public until it was 100%


--I KNOW this probably gets posted a lot here, but I feel like I'm walking a tight rope here--"
theone23four,asktransgender,"Is this a justified form of the ""acceptance process""?","My dad just confronted me again about being trans after he went to a support group last week. Every time he starts talking to me about this he gets angry and has an antagonizing tone. During the conversation I asked why he's angry, and why he always gets angry when talking about this. He responded ""why am I angry? Why am I angry that my son is turning himself into a woman?"", then proceeded to try to justify it by saying he has a right to be angry about this and how it's affecting him, and it's a part of his grieving process etc. He's been talking to trans advocates who tell him he has a right to be feeling things like anger, grief, etc. and he's taking it as he has a right to be mad at ME for being trans."
Saturdalia,asktransgender,What can I do with my hair for now?,"So, having realized that I'm trans several months ago, and after some further soul-searching and therapy, I've decided recently that I'm going to transition from male to female in the next year. Woot! But I'm currently not out to anyone really, and while I've been taking baby steps to express my feminine side, the big issue I face right now is my hair. 

I haven't gotten it cut in six months (it was pretty short to begin with) just because I've always liked having a lot of hair. Now, I have the added incentive of hoping to have a feminine cut/length in the not-too-distant future. It's getting long enough to look kinda shaggy, and nearly covering my eyes (my shitty attempt at bangs), but my work requires me to have a professional appearance.  I'm worried about how to navigate the next six months -- since I can't really come out or start transition until then, for various reasons.

I know that if I want to grow it out right, I will at some point actually have it cut in a feminine way, even if it is short -- with layering, et cetera. But, still presenting as a professional male for now, I feel like it would stand out more than I like. On the other hand, the last thing I want to do is to get it cut short again and start from scratch -- that would kill me. It's mostly bad timing. I think I could probably hold out with my current length for another month, then I have to decide between a simple trim to hold me over for a little while longer, or taking the plunge and getting a feminine cut so that I can properly grow it out. I feel like the first option would make it easier to work and live until I can openly transition, but the second would help me deal with dysphoria a little better. And I would like to keep working on my bangs. I dunno. Does anyone have any experience dealing with a question like this?"
Furchuck,asktransgender,How did you do it?,"So first things first, a question. For all of you out there who have made things better for themselves, how did it get better?

I'll start this out by admitting things probably aren't as bad as they seem for me. My friends are as supportive as it gets, my family doesn't and won't know until I'm in a good place, my country isn't out to get me like some others, I'm slowly working towards having a real support network other than just lurking around here and r/transgender.

However, everything inside is just tearing me apart right now. I've pretty recently realized that I'm trans, and I'm still in the process of figuring out what that means for me. My dysphoria is manageable most days, but that's in part due to just pushing it to the side of my thoughts constantly, and in part due to the ridiculous workload I've made for myself this year (taking a full slate of courses for the first time in my three years of university, on top of volunteering work I have on the side). Because of the above two factors, I don't have any time to work on figuring myself out and working on presenting how I really want to, and it's really starting to take it's toll. The few times I get to feel feminine are taken away as quickly as they come, and even then I have to overcome my own internalized transphobia before it really helps anything. I hate taking these feelings out on strangers over the internet, but there's a lot of this that I haven't been able to tell to my support network in real life, just because of the fear that they'll try to erase me even though they've been so good to me so far."
transquestion_,asktransgender,family and need to transition?,"sorry, this is a reupload because it's one am and I forgot to add a question to the title.  

my dysphoria has been getting worse and worse again (tends to come in phases every couple months).  back in december it was so bad that I almost left my current living situation to move into a friend's house and sleep on her couch while I figured life out.  I'm 22 and have a job but it's not enough to support me because I'm in school and can't handle full time work too.  I'm living with transphobic family who will inevitably be unsupportive when I do come out.  I can move out in a year.  Money will still be tight and there's no guarantee I can afford HRT, although I'm saving every dime I can in order to be able to when the time comes.  I'm struggling with keeping my head above water and not doing something stupid that I'd regret if I live through.  Like I said these bouts of dysphoria induced whatever the hell this is usually go away for me but this is the second one I've had in a couple months and they're getting more intense and impossible to ignore.  My friend's couch is looking really promising but she has a large family and I'm a super quiet/private person and have a hard time with that much noise and intrusion.  Besides the fact that I don't know where I'd put my stuff and I'd be kicked out of my family's house once I come out so I'd have a good car load of stuff with me.

any suggestions?  I don't know how to handle this for another year.  Or even if I can.  "

kokaini,asktransgender,how to bring up transitioning to a doctor? &amp; advice?,"hi. i'm going to be having a doctors appointment in about 3 weeks. i want to bring up being trans to my primary care physician. i'm 19, ftm transgender. i've learned what being trans is &amp; identified with it since i was 13, so it's definitely something i'm sure of.

i live in a conservative state and so i suppose i'm nervous of being rejected or turned down, or something. i know my pcp is a christian, but she seems open minded... i don't know, i'm nervous. i also have a psychiatrist i could bring it up to, i guess.

the point is, i've never told a medical professional anything. i genuinely have no clue on how to bring it up. is there any specific way i should mention it? 

i should also mention i'm mentally ill, including delusions, and issues with identity- which she should know because of the files from speaking with my psychiatrist. will this effect her stance on whether or not she wants to allow me to go through with transitioning?

what questions should i expect from her? is there anything she might say to try and prove that i might not be trans? is there anything i should i avoid mentioning?

thanks so much for any help."
heyycaleb,asktransgender,what to do about mom? (ftm14),"so i'm ftm trans. i'm fourteen and i live with just my mom, came out to her like a year and a half ago. of course, she probably thought everything was a phase. i kept my hair long and wore feminine clothes that she bought for me, i did it all to make her happy. however, i got my hands on a binder thanks to a friend that bought one for me, and i wore the binder almost all the time when i wasn't around my mom. i still bind, but my mom doesn't know. anyways, the first time i came out to her she was extremely unsupportive. she cried and told me she could never call me by my preferred name or pronouns, and it broke my heart. i had been thinking since then, and last night i texted her a giant paragraph about it. she didn't do anything last time, she just pretended like nothing happened the next day. i understand she doesn't want me to be ostracized by my peers for my gender, but all of my friends have been extremely understanding and accepting so far. i explained this in the text message, along with things like ""i really feel happy identifying as male"" and etc. i cut my hair super short against her wishes back in October, and it's getting quite shaggy. i'm scared to have someone trim it again because when i cut it, my mom called me and said ""fuck you, i wasn't ready for you to cut it."" and i knew she would be mad but i did it anyway. i want to cut it again and keep it short but she's making me grow it out. maybe after i sent that text, things have changed but idk. i really want to go as Caleb at high school next year and dress in boys' clothing and keep my hair cropped short. i don't care if my mom struggles to or doesn't call me Caleb, i just want to get her permission to let me identify as Caleb full time. being Haley hurts and it honestly just isn't me, i've always felt distant to myself when i identify as female, like i'm stuck in a shell. my mom definitely understands more. my last and main concern is that she told her brother about the text, and he asked me about it. i'm already out to him so it was no surprise, but he was like ""well your mom's going through some things rn (she hasn't told her boyfriend that she has a kid yet, and she hasn't got a steady job) so she has a lot to balance."" he basically told me not to bring my gender situation up with her verbally until after she tells her boyfriend i exist. i really just want to bring it up tomorrow morning when i see her next, but who knows. what should i do?

structured_spirits,asktransgender,Why do I always feel apart?,"The last year has seen a lot of changes for me. I came out publicly as a mtf transsexual in July, and began presenting as female all the time when not at work. To my surprise, I didn't lose any friends and have had a lot of support. I'm involved with community theatre, and while I expected to remain involved, I thought it likely I would only be offered male roles as before. I was pleasantly surprised to be offered a good female role in our most recent production, which opened this weekend. Everything went well despite my worries, it was a big step for me, because of my voice. Additionally, I go out regularly with girlfriends and although I don't always pass, I am treated well. My point is that I am included, I am accepted.

But when things are over I come home, and I have these feelings that people are just humoring me, that really they're laughing at me behind my back. I know this is not true intellectually, but I always feel so alone and apart, like I am intruding. I feel this way even with family members. I mean this isn't a change, I felt that way before as well, when I was hiding who I was, but I thought that feeling would go away. It's incredibly difficult to go out and be social when I have these feelings, and I am worried I am slipping back into depression. I plan to start seeing a therapist again, but I thought I might ask others here if that had similar feelings and what might cause them, and how to deal with them, how to feel I am a part of a group."
simaiinox,asktransgender,Shortness of breath/increased heart rate on HRT,"Hi! I've been on HRT (MTF) for about 2ish months now. I'm a fit/active person, used to work out 2-3 times/week before hormones to stay really toned, and increased to 4-5 times/week after I started gaining weight fast on estradiol/spiro. 

I also had muscle atrophy which I understand is normal, and so my workouts got a lot harder and I adjusted them accordingly. However, I also noticed that I got out of breath or that my heart would beat much faster/harder much more easily, even when exerting myself at a proportional level.

I've noticed this for about a month or so, but didn't say anything because I thought it was just a part of adjusting, but now I guess I thought I'd ask if this is actually normal or if I should talk to my endo about it.

MonicaRising,asktransgender,Transitioning while working from home / remotely,"Hey all you people ��
So I am now three months into HRT. I've been out to all my friends and family since October 2016 and that coming out really started around June or July of 2016. I just had my follow-up with my Endo today. Things are going great. She mentioned getting gender markers changed legally and all of that good stuff. But for all the coming out I've done, I'm not out at work. The thing is, even though I work for a huge nationwide company, I work remotely from my home 100% of the time and only communicate via phone and email. Absolutely no one that I work with has any idea that I am in transition or that I have come out to everyone that I know outside of work. I think coming out to people that you see face to face is actually a little easier because they can see your sincerity and when it comes to HRT they can actually see the changes and even prior to HRT, if you are like me and presented female, they saw that also. So they know you are for real. And even still I feel like it takes a while for that to sink in with everyone, and that's okay. But do any of you work remotely like I do 100% of the time? How did you come out ""at work""? The last time I ever even saw a colleague was like  2011. I don't have to deal with customers face to face either. On one hand I feel fortunate that I've been able to do things at my own pace and not worry about having to deal with work but now the inevitable is happening and I need to address it at some point soon within the next six months I would guess. I can't exactly legally change my name and my gender and not have work know about that. So all the same fears we always have about being taken seriously are really huge for me right now. I can't stress enough how I feel like I'm living two lives. I mean they have absolutely zero idea and my male mode was as hyper masculine as it gets. They have no idea that my company directory photo looks absolutely nothing like me anymore. Has anyone gotten over this hurdle while working remotely? I don't even have a colleague that I see on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis that I could even test the waters with, so to speak. It's been weighing on my mind heavily lately and I don't know how to approach it and be taken seriously. Or how to approach it at all frankly. Any and all comments and insight from those in similar position are very much appreciated!

I'm not a very confident person in general.

Anyway, dad's aware of my gender issues. He cornered me when we were alone together to have a quick chat about the gender issues. He takes issue with it. He says he wants to protect me from making a mistake and from being beaten up. I get that and understand it, but I think he's overstating the percentage of people who would become violent with me. He says I'm 194cm tall so most people would stare at me and it'd restrict my job options. I feel like that's a bit of an alternative truth but I don't know what's the truth in it. He says I have made bad mistakes before in things I was sure about so I guess he just wants to keep me safe. But then... I dunno, one way or another ""gender issues"" have been a part of my life for about 10 years now.

Eugh. I dunno. I guess my dad isn't an asshole and I'm thankful for that (really!) but he's also kinda misinformed. I'm thankful that my clinic has suggested I try living full time as a woman before I take any meds, that might help me to get my mind cleared out and see if this is right with me."
becoming_madeline,asktransgender,Howard Brown,"
I was on here a few months ago but i went crazy and gave up on transition, but it's come back in a hard way.  After some soul searching and questioning i came to the obvious decision. 

I saw my therapist today, she seemed a little surprised when I told her that I was having feelings again regarding my identity and transition.  She is very affirming and informative, but ultimately the hard work is up to me. 

I contacted BCBSI (BCBSI Illinois) and they cover 100% of HRT and surgeries.  My endocrinologist is booked out until June, so I am getting a referral from my PCP to go to Howard Brown in Chicago!! March 3rd!!  

Since I missed my appointment in January for HRT I don't know what to expect, probably blood work and the HRT.  However , I am a type 2 diabetic but I'm under good control, I have an appointment for my A1C next week, it should be between 7 and 8.  

I just want my transition this time to be like slipping into warn bath water instead of an emotional explosion.   Kind of like losing weight, people don't recognize the small changes until one day they see and are like, ""are you losing weight.""  Baby steps.

I have a weight-loss goal, I'm switching careers into part time real estate since my wife will work full time and I will be the sahm or dad or what ever.  I probably won't go full time until two years, again baby steps so as to let people get used to me without even knowing.

Wish me luck, I really don't want to swing back and forth between hyper masculinity and femmeninity; action and not words, discipline and consistency and love are going to help me through this.

Has anyone here been to Howard Brown and if so how did it go? Also, I'm really tired so sorry if this is rambling on."

This is after coming out to us almost a year ago as gay. I am honestly trying to understand this, but coming from a different generation, it is difficult. What is particularly difficult is that the *only acceptable* option -at least if you listen to social media, is for her to start hormone therapy. Must that always be the end goal? Can there not be transgender people who are able to live in the physical form they were given? Again, I don’t mean to cause an affront to anyone, I’m just asking."
zauraz,asktransgender,Maybe I am just attracted to women in some screwed up way?,"Due to a lot of sexual stuff etc I have been doing for a long time I have some preferences that I am attracted to. These preferences have now made me start to question that maybe I only have this idea of what I want but that it won't be the reality. I don't really know what to do as I can never know how it feels to having grown up and socialized as a woman..

I am 99% sure that if I am transgender, I am a lesbian. But this makes me wonder if maybe I am just a male with a fetish for lesbian sex or something... It feels absurd and wrong. I can't know if what I want is true or how it is... Part of the reason I want to transition is to finally be able to find traits in myself that could look good. There is nothing for me in the male body that is attractive and I hate my own body with disgust. Yet I don't ""feel"" like a girl inside.

I know there is a lot more to being a girl and I long for a lot of traits and possibilities in clothes that I can never see myself being able to express like I am right now and all of this seems more real to me than the current me...

I don't know, I just can't seem to let go of the notion that maybe I just have some screwed up view on women tainted with sexuality and not really are trans like I seem to believe.. Any thoughts on this?"

mikasasukas,asktransgender,"Unique situation for facial hair removal, need help :/","Hello! So my story is a bit complex, so here we go:

Before I came to terms with my identity as transgender I signed up for laser hair removal because I hated my facial hair and wanted it lessened/removed. It appeared that laser hair removal was quite popular so I started it. I'm on my 8th treatment and have finally accepted that I want to make the full transition to becoming a woman. Now here's the problem:

I'm on my 8th treatment and there is definitely less hair than before, though it is far from all gone. Upon researching transgender mtf conversion I'm now reading for the first time about electrolysis and how (apparently) laser therapy isn't permanent??!! I'm a little bit freaking out that I wasted my money and time and I'll now have to switch and undergo electrolysis, and I was wondering if I could get advice on pursuing three different potential strategies:

1) Drop the laser treatment (it's already paid off) and start electrolysis and harmones now.

2) Start harmones now and continue with my laser treatments until they are finished (~2-4 months from now). THEN depending on how much hair is left I electrolysis the rest. (My thinking here is that the harmones and laser might take off most of it and I won't need to pay for as many electrolysis sessions).

3) Just do harmones and laser (I've read a few reports saying that was sufficient for some women.

Any advice? I wish I hadn't made this decision while trying to still pretend I was cis-gender, but I hope this doesn't make things too difficult. Lastly, I've read very mixed reports about how much electrolysis hurts...some say it's just discomfort and some say it's more painful than laser (and laser hurt pretty bad so that's a little scary, especially if electrolysis treatments are an hour long).

Thanks for reading the long post! "

ftmichael,asktransgender,Other adults who transitioned as kids/teens?,"(Cross-posted to a few Trans subs.)

I've been interested for a while now in building community among Trans adults who socially transitioned under the age of 18, whether that included medical intervention or not. I've made a Facebook group, given that that seems like the best way for people to connect - I'm not convinced that we need another barely-used, largely dead Trans subreddit. But I'm open to other suggestions.

The Facebook group is set to Secret, so it isn't findable by search unless you are or were a member, and group members and group content are only visible to current group members. See https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465 for more info on the differences between Open, Closed, and Secret groups on Facebook. The group also isn't binary-only; non-binary folks are very much welcome.

Anyone here who transitioned as a kid or a teen who'd be interested in connecting with more (now-adult) kids like us?"

Aigne13,asktransgender,The American Academy of Pediatrics vs the American College of Pediatricians on the issue of Transgender children,"My question is if anyone else has ever seen people on social media link articles talking about how ""Pediatrics are against children being transgender! See, even the medical field thinks it's damaging!"" I have, and it surprised me that a whole section of the medical community was so openly against transgender people. So I decided to do some digging, and thought I'd share my findings with others.

Turns out, there are two pediatric associations. The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-facts/Pages/AAP-Facts.aspx) (AAP) has existed since the 1930s, and is the largest (64,000) and most respected pediatric association. The other association, the [American College of Pediatricians](https://www.acpeds.org/health-professionals/issues-in-medical-ethics) (ACP), is a much much smaller (500) socially conservative advocacy group founded in 2002, by a former president of the AAP. The ACP was founded to counter the AAP's support of LGBTQ children/youth. As such, their [statements](https://www.acpeds.org/gender-dysphoria-in-children-summary-points) about gender issues are intentionally socially conservative in position. The ACP has a very specific political (and religious) agenda in their statements, and are not the most trusted source for pediatric statements. That would be the AAP, which has said the opposite of the ACP on transgender issues. Here's their [statement](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAPOpposesLegislationAgainstTransgenderChildren.aspx).

Anyway, I hope this is helpful for anyone who's been confused on what most pediatrics publicly say about transgender children/youth. I would urge everyone to question sources (me included) when they read stuff on the internet, and look to see the reasons behind organizational statements, because everyone has their own bias, even large organizations."

1. The terms ""transman and transwoman.""  I assume trans-man  is someone transitioning to male and trans-woman is someone transitioning to female?
Why do you want the differation between being transgender and being the gender you transition to?  


2. The term ""passing.""  Why?


It seems both passing and the terms transman and transwoman buy into societal gender norms.  Men and woman have to appear a certain way, act a certain way, etc.   


To me: If you are a woman, you're a woman, no matter how you look.  Or if you transitioned from being externally male.  If you're a man you're a man.   I'm aware of the dangers and struggles you face.  I'm not trying to ignore them or downplay them.  I want to accept who you are.

Trans_Throwaway_1,asktransgender,Unsure about what I'm feeling...,"Hey everyone. To start off I'm an 18 year old male and for whatever reason, the idea that I would rather be female keeps popping up. This has been going on for around 2 years now off and on. It's strange because some days I feel completely content with who I am as a male and enjoy being one, and on others I'm not so sure. I don't need to force myself to feel good in my own body, it just happens.

Idk if it is a fetish thing or not. Me and My GF of 3 years often do role-reversal type stuff and we both really enjoy it, but recently when I do it I feel guilty as if I am not living up to some sort of standard. 

I have put on make-up and dressed up with a close friend before, and it was a lot of fun, but in my mind I kept thinking I could never pass for a girl. Now that I'm in college, I don't really have anybody who I could tell these feelings to, let alone do anything with them.

I'm scared of these feelings being real. If they are real, I don't know how I'd even act on them, or if I even should. Me and my family have an extremely good relationship, especially with my dad, but this would definitely break their hearts, no question. It's not about them not accepting or loving me, I just don't want to hurt them. 

I don't know whats going on with me as this stuff comes in phases, but it keeps coming back. Please, if anybody has some input, I could really use it.

Kit-K,asktransgender,Dysphoria when Good things happen? [Ramble],"It's always been like this for me. Whenever something good happens in my life, I feel the worst. Or when I do something that should be good for me, I feel terrible in my head.

Lately I've been taking a turn in my life, ultimately for the better. I've been seeing a gender therapist, I'm getting a new job, I've been exercising, cooking. I mean, I'm generally in a better mood. But, now, when something triggers the dysphoria, it comes in 10× worse.

I think it could be that all the good stuff just contrasts the negative so damn much... It's holding me back. I could *be* something greater, but, every. single. time...

I get off my ass and start doing stuff, my brain's like, ""Oh yeah, you like feeling good? Too bad no matter how much you do, you'll **never** be satisfied. You'll never be a *real* woman. Try and be a *real man* again, because that worked out so well, huh?""

It's like I can't just be happy for once. It's a constant cycle. Do good, feel good for a bit then **crash**, feeling bad and doing bad, work my way back to doing good, rinse repeat. I don't know, I'm sick of it... I'm just sick of it.

stardropTabletop,asktransgender,How to get over fear of shopping for bras: UPDATE,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5qxdvw/how_to_get_over_fear_of_shopping_for_bras/

Just figured I'd let everyone know how this situation turned out (I know that this technically isn't a question, so mods, please feel free to delete this post).

Went to a big department store at the mall today with my friend, and there was hardly anyone there. Browsed bras with her, all while reminding myself that I *do* in fact belong there, that this is a physical necessity for me and that I am not a pervert (as my therapist assured me).

No one cared. Not even when I went into the changing rooms and started trying on stuff (and proceeded to realize that I'd grossly overestimated my cup size lol whoops). Not even when I bought a couple of the bras that I'd tried on. No drama *whatsoever*.

And now, I've got a couple of nice bras that fit me great, and I'm wearing one of them now, and my chest is actually *super* noticeable now (even with just a t-shirt on), and I honestly feel *so* good about myself.

If I can go bra shopping, I can do anything. If I can go bra shopping, I can do anything.

It didn't smell or anything like that. It was just moist like you would expect in a vag. She explained to me that the estrogen increased lubrication up there. The intercourse was very pleasurable. I'm well hung down there and I was able to enter a good portion of my penis in her anal cavity without resistance. Again, it was very wet and moist in there.

throwawaytransgirl99,asktransgender,why does being seen as trans post transition bother me?,"throwaway because...reasons.

also TL;DR at bottom

ok so I want to preface this with a bit of back story. I'm a 29 yo trans woman and I feel like I'm ""done"" with my transition. I've been on hormones for 3 years full time for 2 years and post op for a bit less than a year. I still have a little bit of electrolysis to finish up but I'm basically at the end of what I can do transition wise. I was in college when I first started my transition, in a program where you go through 2 years with the same group of 30 people. I took some time off to ""finish"" my transition and one of the reasons was I was unable to focus with everyone knowing I'm trans. Well after I went full time on my break from school I started working and for about 6 months honestly thought no one knew Im trans. Turns out I was wrong and there were whispers the whole time, which made me feel crummy. But I was able to rationalize it as I was still in the ""middle"" of transition and had an adams apple and still had a bit of beard shadow.

Well fast forward to now. I started back in school last fall after SRS and trach shave. It took me until fairly recently to feel comfortable again that no one really knew and I was just seen as a woman and not a trans woman, and then yesterday one of my classmates told me she knows. For some reason this has me devastated. I feel like I will always be seen as trans (not that there is anything wrong with it at all, its just not what I want). now I feel really self conscious about who else in my class knows and what they think. I am also super paranoid this is going to effect my school work just like it did before. I just can't figure out why this bothers me so much and how to get over it.

TL;DR even after my transition is ""finished"" I am seen by some people as trans and it devastates me. "
AlliePiper,asktransgender,Sharing medical resources I've found for my new doctor -- looking for more!,"My new doctor is trans-friendly, but lacks experience with administering HRT. So I've been looking around for resources to share with her.

If you're curious about how HRT works or the process of getting SRS, you're probably already familiar with the [WPATH SOC](http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1351&amp;pk_association_webpage=3926), which is a great resource. However, [this pdf](http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/pdf/Transgender-PGACG-6-17-16.pdf) from UCSF provides far more detail and a lot of secondary sources. Well worth the read, and share it with your doc, too! I just stumbled across it tonight and figured others might find it useful. It covers bits like what various medications do, what forms are preferred and why, how to titrate a proper dose, what lab tests are needed and why, etc. in great detail with many citations.

Sorry if this is old hat, but I've been researching this for a while and this is my first time seeing this particular document.

todayimagirl,asktransgender,Reflections on an unsupportive family in a hostile world,"I had a really terrible conversation with my dad today and it seems impossible for him to ever understand or even be civil about me transitioning.  I'm 7 months in hrt, and my parents, whom I live with, have generally just ignored talking about my transition.  It goes from genuinely feeling like they might understand, to them screaming at me telling me ""I'm fucked up in the head."" This most recent conversation started when I asked them to start calling me by female pronouns, and my legal name.  

And it fucking hurts.  It feels like the entire world, including my family, is against me.  It's not healthy for me to live here, but part of me wants so badly to be accepted.  I want my home and my parents to be safe and loving, like when I was young.  

My story is not unique in any way, and it's often the people closest to us, that drive us to depression and suicide.  Why does the world have to be so shitty to us?  Why can't our family members see, that it is the way they treat us which dictates our fate? My parents tell me that they cant possibly support transition, out of fear I will become homeless, a sex worker.  Yet they will this fate to me.  They drive me out by screaming,  they yell at me to leave in the middle of the night.  I've grabbed my hormones and left the house too many times tearful and afraid, only to return thinking things will get better.  I wish I had supportive parents, a supportive family, and I could be anything I ever wanted to be, not the fate they doom me.

I think my parents do love me in some twisted way that seems to come out in hate and scorn, and just feels so bad.  

Its overwhelming.  Changing documents, dealing with hormone tests and new emotions, being discriminated against while looking for work, trying to survive in this world as a transgender person, and then coming back to a place where it's supposed to be safe by people who are suppose to care for you, only to be hated more.  It's the multitude of things that breaks you and beats you down. Drives u to take a handful of pills or jump in front of a train.  

How do they not see?  

I know I need to leave my situation, but the world is harsh.  I don't want to sleep in my car or travel far distances in the hope of finding a place of support and love.  I'm sick of housing ads that go flat at the mention of being trans and jobs who surely would prefer a cis candidate over a trans one.  Maybe its that you have to be rich and skilled to live in the sf bay area but it sure seems that the world is not meant for us.  

Homeless, jobless, family-less.

fuckthistransshit,asktransgender,"What the fuck am I doing with myself, I'm not trans","I've fucked my self up. 





I'm 17 and a half. I'm not really trans. I've forced myself to be this way. 



I've been perfectly fine with crossdressing in private since I was 7. 






But then I discovered what gender dysphoria was when I was depressed about September time, and now I'm like this. 




I go on this sub everyday, and have done since October. I just want to know what I am, but I don't know. 



I think I hate being male, but in reality I'm fine with it. When I'm at home I think ""I hate having to go out as male in public, if I were to go out as female I'd be so much better"". Then I go out as male, and I think ""oh this is fine, what am I complaining about?"". 






When I don't feel trans, I forget about it. Then  I'll remember about it, and I'll have it on my mind and I have to go on this sub to control these thoughts, it's like an addictive drug that I have to take in order to stop. 


If there was a button that would instantly change me into a woman, no regrets, I'd probably press it. But there isn't. Plus living as male is easier anyway, why put the extra effort into something that I might not be? 



I don't want to do anything about this. I'm scared of being cis, but I'm scared of being trans. Like, if I'm cis I can get on with my life. If I discover I'm trans, I can get on with my life and start transitioning. 



These thoughts often have to get triggered on way or another. There is this one song that reminds me of being trans everytime I play it (probably because I listened to it a lot when I felt suicidal about this a couple of months ago), so if I feel less dysphoric I'll play this song as it will trigger it. 


I take those ""am I trans"" tests online and try and enter the ""correct"" answer so I get trans to come up. I will try and convince myself I'm trans, just because I can imagine being female and I'll feel so much better. 



I'm a crossdresser. I only really care about women's clothes, I'm not too bothered about having a women's body. But am I? One moment I will see I'm trans then I'll say I'm a crossdresser. I'd rather be born female, but that's because I would of been raised as a girl and would of given the option to wear women's clothes. 




I've pretty much fucked up my a-levels, I never bother doing any of the work, I've basically been told I'm going to fail them. I don't even care, I don't care about life. 



What should I do? I feel like a crossdresser or a feminine guy right now, but give it a couple of hours had I'll hate myself and I might feel suicidal. 




I don't see the point in transitioning if I only feel like this when I'm alone. 


Does anyone feel/have felt like this? I'm not sure what to trust anymore, I think I've made myself this way

runanddrinkbeer,asktransgender,Supporting partner who won't come out?,"I'm a cis queer lady dating another one, except probably not. 

In all likelihood, my partner is trans (I suppose I should crosspost to /r/mypartneristrans, huh?). When we are in very accepting spaces (and usually drunk), she tells people her pronouns are they/them-he/his. She is jealous of our trans guy friends, and vocalizes wanting to be like them.

By ""very accepting spaces,"" I mean parties with my queer friend network full of people who ask you upfront ""what are your pronouns?"" when they ask your name. People who reassure you they'll be flexible should you change your pronouns in the future. In day-to-day life, she is she/her through and through, despite people consistently ""misgendering"" ""her"" and referring to her as ""him"", due to her pretty nonbinary presentation.

Generally, she doesn't want to talk about it, definitely not while sober. But we were just at a party where she told someone new that her pronouns are ""they/them,"" and I feel like an ass going about my life calling her ""she/her"" because that's what she goes by day to day. There are probably a handful of people from parties who know her as they/them and the rest of her life is she/her, and I'm her girlfriend and I have no fucking clue what to do or how to refer to her.

She won't talk to me about it. We've almost been dating two years. I don't know what to do and feel very selfish for wanting her to talk to me. But I just don't know what to do. I want to support her and I know she's scared especially with the current political climate.

Not even sure what I'm asking. Just looking for insight.

The drug Spironolactone was suggested by an endocrine specialist.  I've looked over the side effects and contraindications and I feel informed enough to start the drug.  I've given him the go-ahead to put in for the prescription once he checks my CT scan results (precautionary step to rule out an adrenal gland problem).  

I'm excited to start the drug in hopes of reducing/eliminating unwanted body hair and facial hair but I was wondering if it can cause mood or personality changes or if it can cause weight gain.  We spoke about several topics but I didn't think to ask the Dr about those issues during the consultation.  I've looked over the fact sheet but don't recall anything about personality changes or weight gain.  I was also hoping it could soften/feminize my facial features because I have a sort of androgynous look and was often mistaken for male in my teens, in spite of not trying to look male and having long hair (but wore ""tomboy"" clothes).

Also, I always thought it was cool that I have kind of biggish biceps for a woman and can readily put on muscle but I wonder if I will lose muscle or strength when on the drug.

LauraTFem,asktransgender,At the intersection of Transgender and Atheist,"Hello, all, first time posting. I was reading a Reddit thread a few days ago here on the subject of prayer, (and how it doesn't do anything) specifically the kinds of prayer young children pray; for miracles, like waking up one day as your target gender by some sort of devine intervention. I was surprised by the number of responders who posted that they don't believe in God anymore, some as a direct result of their unanswered, deeply earnest prayer.

Now, while I don't think there are any bad reasons to be an atheist, I would consider this sort of argument weak, because it assumes that if there was a god it must necessarily be one of those which accept prayer; or, for that matter, one which cares for the lives of humans. This is an odd assertion, because the god that you as an individual we're raised to believe in is no more more likely to be the real one than any other.

But this digresses from my intended topic, because I had always been under the impression that most of my fellow trans people were faithful. Not necessarily believers in god, per se, but I thought that a lot of us were members of pagan faiths, or other such new-age woo. I'm not really sure what made me think this, and I must admit here that it may have been a form of internalized trans-phobia; because I am vehemently anti-woo, wheather it is in the form of a Judeo-Christian god or some Mother Earth Goddess worship.

I had been believing until now that I was somewhat unique as an atheist who is trans. But I suppose that's silly because for me, because of the things I was raised to believe, becoming an atheist, or at least switching faiths, was a necessary step on the way to accepting myself.

So, this a question sub, right? Then my question to you is; Would you consider yourself atheist? Or at least agnostic about spirituality? Do you think that you are/would be happier as yourself without faith?"

Trying to sort out my brain again and figure out next steps.

**Preface:**

I'm a 28 year old guy.  I've actually been on this subreddit before under another throwaway asking questions about 4 or 5 years ago actually, but I began to feel a lot better about myself and kind of stopped thinking about it a lot.

**History**

&amp;nbsp;  
**Childhood**

To start off, I can remember having these weird imaginative dreams when I was 5 and 6 about being transformed into a girl.  The confusing part about this was these dreams never made me sad; I knew I was a boy and I guess it didn't really bother me.  However that was so many years ago that I don't even remember the emotions around them.  I don't particularly remember them being depressing though.

Strangely enough I do remember when I was about 4-5, at least I think I do (I mean at 28, remembering shit that happened 24 years ago or more is a little crazy), having an imaginary friend named 'no nuts'.  I remember my parents laughing about it.  I don't think I've ever told anyone about this fact ever, but here it is on reddit.  Go anonymity.

I did however, cry myself to sleep a lot repeating that I was stupid or messed up, but most of that was from other kids making fun of me because I was short and small.

Generally my childhood was that of every average boy.  I liked video games and hated the outside.  I was really shy around girls and girls didn't really interact with me.

&amp;nbsp;  
So with that out of the way, let's segue into...

**Adolescence**

As a young boy, puberty wasn't much different from anyone other kid. I remember being really moody, and growing hair all over.  None of that especially bothered me other than kids still making fun of me for being weird.  I was more interested in video games than girls, so obviously I got called gay a lot.

I also remember being quite shy towards girls (I still am! I feel like women intimidate me very easily and I don't really relate very well to them, like I'm on an island watching them from afar).

I also, due to the craziness of puberty, had breast buds start up, and they even lactated a bit.  I panicked about this because I was supposed to be a boy!  Boys don't do this!

They got really sensitive and hurt a lot when I touched them.  I remember panicking and asking my dad and and he just laughed at me, which really helps a kid going through changes. Honestly I think he was just as confused as I was.

I do remember hating dress clothes and not caring how I dressed or looked because no matter what I didn't think I looked cool or like the other boys.

I also remember seeing someone on Oprah that was a trans woman and being *enthralled*  I couldn't do any research on it though but I remember this sticking out to me, and I was extremely scared to show any interest in it.

However, a couple of noteworthy things that I think back on kind of steer me into thinking I'm on the transgender spectrum somewhere.

The first was a time where I (around 10 years old or so) would take pictures of me (Of which there were not many, I didn't really like getting pictures taken and still don't, because I feel unattractive.), and superimpose them on female models.  I thought this was really funny, and I'd do this for hours and show off what I did to my parents.  I didn't think anything of this at the time, but I think my parents got a little concerned and started giving me hints to knock it off.  I eventually stopped doing this and went back to playing with the neighbor kids and stuff.

The second was around when I was 12 where I had this strange desire to put on girls clothes.  I felt really ashamed about this and told NOBODY.  When I was left at home or my uncle was watching us, I would sneak off for a shower and put on my mom's underwear and bras and clothes and look at myself in the mirror.

This was also around the time I figured out masturbation so naturally this made me exceptionally aroused.  Again though, I thought I just liked wearing womens clothes, not that it meant anything more.

The 3rd time was around the same period of time, I started playing in my mom's makeup.  I used to do this as much as I could while 'showering'.  Lipstick, foundation, powder, etc.  My mom almost caught me a few times, but never did.  I don't know what I would have explained if I did get caught, that was probably my biggest fear as a kid.

This got so bad that over time I amassed a collection of clothes that I 'acquisitioned' from my mom in my bedroom hidden in a drawer that wasn't easily accessible or used that I would dress in while my brother was asleep in the same room.  Usually this would end in masturbation.

I purged these when we moved, and crossdressing got less frequent due to time constraints.  The makeup thing stopped as well.

I remember being kind of sad that I couldn't explore this more, but I wouldn't say depressed.

Eventually I started exploring my sexuality and penetrating myself.  I won't get into details with this because the way I explored this involved something that is more embarassing than wearing makeup or crossdressing, and is probably the worst violation of trust you can do, and I still feel horrible about it to this day, but I'm sure you can connect the dots if you read this whole thing.  Points if you guess correctly though I guess.

I remember imagining being a girl and being penetrated.  This idea excited me despite the reality.  Again at the very least I thought I was a crossdressing bisexual at this point.

Towards the later point of my teenage years I used to play roleplaying games (Furcadia if anyone is curious) where I was a femme guy crossdressing and stuff, or even pretending I'm a girl.  This usually coincided with sexual arousal so masturbation was involved and sexual rp as well.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Early Adulthood and beyond**

As I said earlier, I started exploring my sexuality in my later adolescent years and so I had come to terms with the fact that I was probably a bisexual guy that liked girl clothes.

I eventually started dating a guy I met through a social group but I wasn't into it a whole lot.  Mostly we would visit, have sex, and cuddle.  I found out here that I didn't really find men that attractive, but I *loved* being on the submissive side of the relationship; the feminine side.

I also remember playing games like Aion and toying around with the female avatar creator, making cute avatars, and getting a flush of embarassment and closing it down.  I actually do this with attractive women as well.  I tend to look at them in fascination and feel embarassed.

Eventually I got a job and started buying sex toys and using these during my alone time.  Once again, the fantasies weren't that I was a guy necessarily, but that I was representing the female role.  I will say my imagination kind of started dying down a bit and becoming more rooted in reality; that I was a man.  Still, stimulating myself in that role was extremely exciting to me and the only reason I don't still do it is because I feel in my current situation I don't have the time or space to do it.

At this point whenever I see that someone is a transgender girl, I tend to obsessively look at their pictures and want to learn about them.  I've found trans women fascinating since my teenage years for some reason.

After talking to someone about my 'panty fetish' around 5 years ago (And after buying some new panties for the first time in years), I jokingly said that I might be trans for all I know.

After this thoughts started pouring in and I was hit in the face that yes, I might be trans.  I remember sitting in my bed in a pair of boy shorts, tights, and a spaghetti strap top + bra (I'd like to add I looked ridiculous I'm sure being an overweight dude) feeling super nervous and anxious, but at the same time kind of enjoying it as well.

I hit up reddit, asked a bunch of questions, did a ton of research, and even talked to a therapist on the phone for a minute with the plan to schedule an appointment.  Ultimately I didn't due to a lack of money, and I wonder what would have been if I just did it.

Afterward I dated a girl briefly (Actually the first girl I ever dated, and the 2nd person in my entire life I've dated) and after a round of 21 questions out of boredom I mentioned that I liked to wear womens' clothes.  One day she invited me over and instead of doing anything interesting, she started showing me makeup and stuff she had got in the mail since I was into that stuff and I literally froze.  I couldn't react to it.  I felt ashamed and embarrassed somehow even though she was totally cool about it.

I should also add here that I feel like I'm incredibly hard to open up.  I found out the hard way with her that if someone tries to pry into me too hard I just close shut and withdraw.  I can guarantee that in person nobody knows ANY of the above facts about me.

I crossdressed from the comfort of my bedroom a few times from then on, and another move forced me to purge everything.

&amp;nbsp;  
Fast forward to today.  I went to buy a car and had to order one, and signed off on it.  After doing that I had 3 days of panic attacks and freakouts and I cancelled the whole thing.  I thought it was stuff I was worried about with my job, all I know is for a week I was miserable and wanted to puke.

I feel like this and the next event are what started my spiral in to questioning my gender again.

I recently started playing the new Shantae game (if you haven't seen it, it's about a super cute genie with transformation powers that fights stuff by whipping her hair around!) and after playing it for a while I felt something...off and strange.  Like shame.  I couldn't really describe it.

All I know is I started getting more and more depressed in the following days and ended up putting the game down.  I started freaking about my career, and my general anxiety level has gone through the roof.  I've been freaking out about the fact that I'm single, but not really knowing what to do as a guy, and the fact that I'm a guy means that I need to act in a certain way to attract women, and dress a certain way, and I don't really want to dress that way.

Then the next thing I know I start looking at cute girls and realize I'd rather be wearing their clothes... then the dread comes.

That if I'm transgender, and the fact that if I am, transition is too hard, the fact that it might not turn out how I would want it to, the fact that I might not be able to maintain gainful employment, the fear of rejection, the whole thing.  Then I'm terrified.

Next thing I know I'm browsing online for panties and stuff again to hopefully destress a little, and looking up therapists in my area to talk about social anxiety and by proxy gender issues.


**Does anyone here have a similar experience?**

I don't even know what kind of therapist to look for or anything, or if I should get a referral from my GP about this or look for someone on my own.  I also doubt my insurance is going to cover any of this.

I just want to stop stressing over this stuff.  I feel like something like this means I'm a failure to my parents, and it's this horrible secret that I have to keep to myself because questioning your gender isn't really a standard mode of thinking.

Sorry if this was a long rant, I'm just really frustrated and wanted to vent *everything* and hopefully someone listens and has something (anything!) to add.

**I want to also clarify that I'm not anywhere close to killing myself or any other form of self harm.  I know that's common with transgendered people so I wanted to make that very clear for anyone that might wonder if that's on the table after reading this.

At the worst I'm just a giant ball of anxiety that's meandering through life, and I guess that isn't so bad after all.**"
egftwegtwg,asktransgender,"As a (just turned) 20 year old MtF, what can I expect from HRT?","From what I understand, earlier is always better assuming you're mentally prepared, and twenty is a very good age. There are two things I'm curious about. YMMV, I know.

How can HRT affect my bones? From what I gather, the most noticeable effect is hip growth. As for the rest I can't seem to get a definitive answer. I'm most curious about the broadness of my shoulders, which I'm super insecure about. Does anyone have some transtimeliness pictures of broad shouldered pre-transition trans girls, especially without a lot of fat/muscle?

What can I expect from HRT, mentally, both in the long term and short term? This especially I can't get a definitive answer for. Some say fatigue, some say depression, some say euphoria. My favorite is crying/emotionalism. I cry a lot as is and crying feels euphoric, like earlier I was thinking about how someone did something for me just to make me happy and I broke down into euphoric tears. If I could get more of that on E that would be awesome. "
WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,"""But... Are you REALLY sure?"" (TEXT WALL)","I just want to be a girl but my mind is being an absolute asshole as always...

I know up to this point that I am pretty much trans, I've been reading and researching, slowly finding out things from my childhood that I forgot, maybe not the most obvious things but they were there, I always was envious on how most females looked and why can't men look like them, so I'd say that's pretty trans but, that's not the problem.

The two problems are, I can't tell if I am legitimately feeling things or am I just 'creating' certain feelings, especially when it comes to gender dysphoria and secondly, I can't handle this up and down if it is dysphoria, whenever I get a eureka moment when it comes to me being trans I feel all confident and such but when I wake up the next day, I don't feel much of anything. Don't get me wrong, I definitely don't feel ""Yay, I am a cis male!"" or anything near that it's just, indifference, when I look back on it, I feel (or at least think I feel) dysphoric.

I know gender dysphoria is much larger than what people may think and not always as severe as some people and I am pretty sure I have it due to the fact that I avoid looking the mirror as much as possible until I can style it in the most feminine way I can with my terrible hair, I sometimes can't stand my voice feeling it makes me sound like the brutish broad guy that my body shows, I have never been masculine as I have never enjoyed being masculine (it's the reason I couldn't stand to play rugby anymore), I've typed in broad statements like ""fuck testosterone"" into asktransgender just because I wanted to see if any thread would pop up that would relate to me (spoilers: it didn't) and finally, the fact that I am here typing this.

Mind you there is more symptoms of gender dysphoria I probably have (circling around body image and more) but the problem comes when I just, DON'T feel dysphoric, I just feel neutral and even though I have balled my eyes out, scratched the shit out of myself sometimes and had some 'darker' thoughts (I won't go into detail unless you ask), I seem to LATCH onto the times when I am not dysphoric which is a great example of human negativity bias which might also make you think, ""Doesn't being not dysphoric a good thing and not negative?"" NOPE, IT'S NOT, I would take away others dysphoria and experience for them so I could have one thing, confidence that I am not making all of this up in my head, even though I know it sounds stupid but it's because I want to be a girl and making times where it's like ""But... Are you REALLY sure? Because you can't even name off why you wanna be a girl!"" doesn't really help and I try to answer 'myself' with ""I wanna be a scientist, I don't know how or why but I still want to be one, so it's the same concept!"" but then my brain just gives me the cold shoulder for a bit and then I THINK the dysphoria comes back but I really don't know if it's true yet my BIGGEST fear, is that I am NOT trans.

I am just stuck in a vicious cycle, sort of like a washing machine, it stops sometimes for a few seconds, then starts going in the other direction of hell... I don't want to be unsure, I just want to be hit by the 'sureness' fairy and failing that I am just tempted to see how long I can make this the dysphoria is intolerable but I agreed to myself I need to sort this out pronto (not within a day or two but not years), because I am young, 16 and I have the best opportunity for the best results and just about EVERYONE waits on here and regrets it, I want to look back in the future and be like ""I wish I transition when puberty started and I wish I knew back then"" not ""I wish I didn't stop myself from transitioning"" and all of this just makes me wanna spontaneously come out to one of my parents sometimes but I hold back as I don't think this is the best month. I can only see three ways of me coming out, 1. One of them asks me how my day was and I just snap spilling everything 2. I go UP TO THEM and snap about everything or 3. I carefully plan everything I am going to say, while waiting a few more months for I do anything BUT sometimes I feel like I should come out NOW so that I can quickly get on some puberty stoppers to halt any masculine harm to my body.


This is a side question and I am quite curious about it as well, though not as much as the stuff I said above but it still grates at me... I haven't been particularly feminine in my life but I definitely haven't been masculine so my question is do you have to learn how to be feminine, can you change your mannerisms and personality from the neutral train wreck mine is because I hate most of the things that come out my mouth or do most trans people find themselves to be feminine at first? I want to become more feminine but is that just unrealistic or is the reason I am not feminine because of factors like all my friends are male and they are all pretty masculine so it's a sort of environmental factor I can't control because honestly, when I was young, most of my friends were female (when I had friends) the ones I have now are only my friends because we were in a common group that I was forced to stay in (it's not all bad but honesty, I don't care for it as much as I did).

When it comes to being feminine, would perhaps experimenting some more help with that as well as potentially clearing up some doubt? For awhile now, I've been trying to grow out my hair, keeping my nails healthy, losing some weight and finally SHAVING ALL THE HAIR (which I really enjoy actually, my legs are so smooth and lovely) but I don't think that's near enough or it doesn't mean much. I think maybe some makeup, a few articles of clothing and just would help but the problems are that I am scared that I will just feel ugly in it with my terrible male body and be scared off by it and as well, I can't particularly really get any makeup and clothing on my own because I can't really go out to do it nor can I shop online WITHOUT coming out to my family/parents, having absolutely no female siblings. I have a feeling it would help but it as well, falls victim to the fleeting dysphoria problem where I think, ""But... Am I REALLY sure I'd want to do that?""


All of this considered, I'd also like to say one thing, does it mean alot if I am coming back to this subreddit 24/7 looking for answers because I can't stay away and I can't stop thinking of it? I am also sorry for the length of this post, I didn't mean for it to cover more than my problems with dysphoria but I just had to ask about the other stuff, I respect if you can't answer it all (even though there aren't very particular questions, sorry about that)."

Lots of helpful tips from a lot of people. After some thought I eventually reached the conclusion that I care about her and I would expand my comfort zone to make her happy. When we met up to hang out things got physical again and I tried out some new stuff. Things were  ok. Even though I did not particularly enjoy they physical side performing oral, I did highly enjoy seeing her excitement and enjoyment. I guess her satisfaction and happyness is more important then my once rigid sexual boundaries. We are both quite happy and can see good times ahead. One last thing to ask. She does not mind telling people she is trans, but she has asked me not to tell my friends. This I am ok with but wont that eventually come to the surface? Should I just let it happen naturally? "

joshumsm,asktransgender,I think I might be trans but I'm really not certain,"I'm a 21 year old male, and I've been crossdressing since at least age 15. For most of that time I thought it was just a weird kink which I was really embarrassed about and hated myself for, but recently I've been a lot more at peace with it. Last year I grew my hair out and pierced my ears and nose to attain a more androgynous look, which I've been really happy with, but lately I've been feeling as though it might be more than just a kink? I've started feeling as though just wearing the clothes isn't what appeals to me, and that I want to actually have the body of a female. However, I don't know whether this is just a sexual desire or if I'll actually be happier if I transition. I'm content looking as I do now (a quite feminine dude), and know that I hate the idea of being a very masculine guy, while the thought of living as a woman full-time is just so exciting and appealing. My attitude about this fluctuates fairly often, so sometimes all I can think about is how nice it'd be to be a girl, and sometimes I'm just happy as I am. I just really wish I knew for sure one way or another. Is there anyone out there who felt a similar way to me and transitioned? I just don't want to make a decision I'll regret.

bashfultransboi,asktransgender,You're Trans; Now what?,"I hope my timing isn't inappropriate.

This is an addendum of sorts to u/Harpoon385's [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5uv687/for_anyone_questioning_their_gender/?st=1Z141Z3&amp;sh=e2d4dfdb). 

My writer's voice tends to be stern so I would like to apologize in advance if I come across as arrogant or if I present things as the only way to do things-- I'm not that presumptuous; however, this may motivate you to do what is necessary, which of course varies from individual to individual.

But I digress.

If you're reading this, I'm assuming you've already battled doubt, dysphoria, and disbelief of your circumstance-- are still battling it, or perhaps you realize you're ready to.

I cannot lie to you about this. Whether you present yourself as confident in who you are or don't hide the fact that you are unsure, some days all it will take is someone using the incorrect pronoun to send you hurtling back to the most depressing crevices of your sub-conscience. Even if passing isn't your goal. Even if you pass all of the time. Even if passing never occurred to you at all. 

Life may very well become that difficult for you. 

And there will be days where the weather was beautiful, the sun reminded you you are a sight to behold, you were kind to everyone, you laughed, called someone you hadn't talked to in some time and explained and were accepted... and still when you go to bed, you will
hurt. 

I'm not religious, but if there is a hell, I feel that it could be here on this planet. But think of it this way... even if you were to spend eternity in the fires of ""hell"", whatever that means, would you not jump at the chance for 5 days, 4 hours, 3 minutes, or perhaps just 20 seconds in a cooler when you wanted or earned it?

Just as there will be awful days where you wonder why exactly you're still trying, there will be days where the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you may as well be ethereal. 

If you catch yourself procrastinating or hesitating to do
something good for you and then disliking yourself, immediately do what you thought you should have (omit: homicide, suicide, most violent acts unless between consenting adults). It has gotten me where I am, nearly 3 months HRT, not quite thriving but more than surviving, and... doin' me. Lovin' myself, Treatin' myself. Living on my own with a job, a roof
over my head, and a good support group.

You'll feel guilty giving yourself what you deserve but that is simply a sign of humility which we must all have. 

Family... I sighed as I typed that word. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth to hear it, but it is
possible for birth givers to stop loving you. No inspirational quote is absolute. Take my own family, for example. There will be people who patronize you and pretend it's acceptance, and you might not be able to change that. Only time will tell if it is in your best interest to endure that, and ultimately it will be up to you.

Maybe where you live isn't ideal. It doesn't have the resources you need, there are too many people who knew you when you weren't quite yourself. Maybe all you want is to start over. Why aren't you? Really figure out why. Then start asking yourself ""what if I HAD to go? What would I have to do to get wherever it is I'm going?"" Find your friends, they'll become your new family. Start making some connections, Learn things that interest you and start speaking your mind. Apologize only when necessary and never more than twice on the risk of sounding insincere, and defend yourself when someone does you a bad turn-- often all it takes is someone to call out plainly and politely for the other to realize what they've said-- and if you let someone talk about you incorrectly, who's to say you won't start doing it too if not more?

And finally. Something I've realized recently. The sorts of people we read about in books, the heroes, romancers, entrepreneurs, the ones who made a difference no matter how finite; Often these people, in the real world, are the ones who get kicked down the most, given what seem like some of the most impossible tasks. 

We are naturally those types of people. I am young and stupid and it is against my nature to do so but I am giving you the benefit of the doubt here and telling you that I believe you can handle your shit. 

And if it's not working, try harder. And if it's still not working? Try even harder. When you've said ""fuck this"" at least a dozen times, re-evaluate what it will take to get what you want, and then go fucking get it.

We're not all perfect, we're not all ugly, but we all have potential in our own rights. Your worst enemy at this time in your life is you. Defeat them, befriend them, love them and then get what you fucking deserve."

PrincessLobster,asktransgender,4 months MtF HRT and I'm starting to notice things about guys I wouldn't before... hmmmm,"Yeah, so... I always identified as bi but leaning heavily towards women when I was still presenting as male (I'd always tell people ""I could see myself with a guy but it would have to be the right one""), and the times I'd tried to do anything with a guy it usually just felt weird and I stopped anything serious from happening. Now though, 4 months into HRT, things seem to be changing a bit. Like how when I went to the store recently and the young 20something male cashier made a comment about one of the things I was buying, and my first thought was ""he's cute and I wonder if he's hitting on me"" instead of ""oh cool, someone else likes this thing too"" like I would have been pre-HRT. Or how I had my best guy friend over recently and it was the first time I've been out around him, using new name and pronouns and dressed that way too, and there was this one part where he was bending over for some reason and I saw his underwear. Before I would have been like ""why are you wearing boxers those are so uncomfortable"" in my head and moved on, but this time I couldn't look away for a sec. Also, he's always been more handsy with me than normal for two ""bros,"" I think. Like putting his hand on my knee and rubbing it to get my attention, jokingly grabbing me from behind or picking me up, etc. and my girlfriend says that him and I always ""flirt"" with each other when we talk, like every sentence is laced with some kind of flirting (that's how it's been since I met him years ago, and I was presenting as male that whole time). Oh, and he identifies as straight and has only ever dated girls, so I don't think he's secretly gay lol. 

Hmmm... is all this normal? for other girls who've taken HRT longer than I have, where do you think I might end up? At this point I'd say I'm still attracted to women, but it's mostly masculine women and I notice men so much more now."

I know that sounds weird.

I get that doubts sort of come with the territory, but I feel like I have way more doubts than I should at this point. It's like there's something blocking me mentally from fully accepting this.

after just finishing a pleasant meeting with my therapist, we had to go out of the room to get a paper and talk to the front desk and there was a guy there and just public areas in general overwhelm me and i find myself becoming a different person, not expressing myself, essentially being a well-perfected male act, and it happens almost automatically xp 

i think i can overcome it through relaxing and caring about wanting to be myself, but i start doubting which one is the real self and then i start gendering everything and its just argh.  alskdfjads;flkj  

like i need to fit in with guys, so i become one. even tho i dont need to anymore, i get ashamed at my transness and feel (INFP) their reactions to me viscerally (and i also tend to assume the worst) 

if you have any advice i would be all ears, otherwise just something i needed to get off my chest"

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5t8e6l/i_came_out_what_should_i_do_now/

Since then, I have made no progress.. :/

Considering my anxiety is somewhat of an issue (It being the reason I'm to afraid to come out.), I could possibly use that as a front to see a therapist?

Provided the therapist is experienced with gender dysphoria (Ie; has had previous transgender clients), this could possibly work. Although through my investigation, there aren't any specialist gender therapists in my area.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Any advice is appreciated. "
sexworkthrowaway111,asktransgender,"Trans ladies who've done sex work, I need some advice on how you set boundaries with clients (specifically about things that made you dysphoric)","Hey, so I used to escort a few years ago, I'm (slowly) starting to do it again, and I wanted some advice. I'm not that great at setting boundaries, well I'm ok at communicating them but not really at putting my foot down. I guess I've made my peace with the fact that a lot of clients are chasers or random dudes who don't actually see me as a woman, as long as they don't rub it in my face. I'm ok with being totally naked and if a client wants to look and fantasize about whatever I'm cool with that. My limits are that I don't want to top or have an erection and basically don't really want to be touched in front down there :/ I know that a lot of escorts and porn stars stop hormones or take Viagra or something to stay hard even if they aren't topping or receiving oral. I'm definitely not willing to do that at this point, and I'm hoping to get advice on how y'all communicated boundaries that had to do with dysphoria. (Whether it's in person or in the framing of your ad). Have you had luck just writing that you're a bottom &amp; not fully functional in your ad? I don't know if that would scare off clients and maybe it's not exactly safe as far as law enforcement goes? When I escorted before I wasn't on hormones so I didn't need Viagra, and I was really easily pressured into doing things that made me feel dysphoric. Without going into too many details I'm in a better place as far as mental health goes, so this whole making ppl respect your boundaries things is new to me and I wana learn :p :p I'm still really sensitive to what ppl say though, so I wouldn't want to be in the position where a client made a joking not joking comment that i should stop hormones/AA so that I would be hornier for him. Even though I can obv say no, it's a situation I'd rather just avoid in the first place.

Random other questions I had cuz i probably shouldn't make another post: I don't really want to offer GFE at the moment, but do y'all have makeup advice for heavy beard shadow that would allow for making out. Right now I use sooooo much dermablend and my face is definitely too weird and sticky even for light kissing.

How often is anal safe, if I do higher volume and 3 or 4 sessions a day long term is this safe? Do I have to care for myself any differently than I would for anal a couple times a week? I mean I guess technically it should always be ymmv with services you offer but I imagine I wouldn't get too many repeats if I charged full service prices for a blowjob. I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, I'd definitely love to make the same money with just oral haha"

vandalheartsgrl,asktransgender,[MtF] Is rapid weight loss (or gain) normal?,"So, I've always been pretty under weight, but I'm 5'5 and carry it well. I started hrt about 5 months ago at nearly 160 pounds, and have noticed consistent weight loss since, with little effort put in. This morning, the scale read 132 pounds.

The only real exercise I get is cardio from work (around 6-10,000 steps a shift) and I don't eat as clean as I'd like to. I don't drink much alcohol anymore, my portion sizes are mostly less than what they've been in the past, but I've never been much of a big eater anyway. 

I expected weight change for sure, but losing close to 30 pounds in 5 months when I've been mostly sitting around playing Skyrim these days feels quite severe.

I don't feel ill or unhealthy, and I've likely answered my own question with the portion sizes and cut in alcohol consumption, but I am interested if anyone else has had similar experiences, either with loss or gain.

TheTigersComeAtNight,asktransgender,Symptoms of Menopause / Estradiol Withdrawal -- Dry Mouth and More?,"Withdrawal seems like a dramatic word but I think it makes the point.

Early last week, I stopped taking my daily dose of estradiol (8mg/daily) per instructions from my surgeon.  

I got through most of the week fine but woke up yesterday with a very dry mouth, dry throat and itchy eyes.  

I can only assume this is a symptom of tanking levels of estrogen coupled with low levels of testosterone (&lt;7).  I woke up in the middle of the night with this revelation.

What other symptoms did others experience as a consequence of stopping estradiol cold turkey or otherwise experiencing menopause?  I've been warned about hot flashes.

For me:

1.  Loss of appetite.  I haven't eaten nearly as much all week.
2.  Dry mouth, throat and eyes.
3.  Trouble sleeping.  I've been waking up in the middle of the night more often than usual.  Fitful dreams.

SouthernCisMale,asktransgender,I really would like to apologize,"I am a simple white guy from Arkansas and to make this short, I would like to apologize to the trans community and especially trans women. Until the last year or so, for about 10 yerars, I've been in denial and really suppressed my own attractions toward a very special group of women that are now close to my heart. I used to think that I was better than people who are transgender. I never insulted or acted out in a negative way towards anybody but just thought really immature and dumb thoughts. But I also figured out in the process that im attracted to women regardless of genitalia. And that i don't care at all who you are, you should be judged by how you treat others ( something my grandmother taught me but I forgot ). My opinion now is that I don't know why men don't attempt to date transwomen. Btw I hate connotations and labels. So if you are a woman, you're a woman. 

I think going through a transition to become who you really are and braving the storm says so much about your character and resolve. To me, that is why I think I truly find transwomen far more desirable as a partner. That among alot of others. 

Also one other thing. I wish I could read more stories and testimonies of cis guys with transwomen in relationships and success things like that. Heck I really just wish I had more friends and allies in the community. I live in a conservative area that, let's just say , has known enemies of the entire community. So it's really a catch 22."

It might be because I am so used to everyone saying that trans people are ""just doing it for attention"" and I'm incredibly afraid of being/appearing ""pretentious"" as it is. And with how trans people (specifically trans women, at least from what I've seen) have become such a hot topic recently, I'm afraid that people will think I'm just doing whatever is ""popular"" right now or that it's just a phase.

MagmusCivcraft,asktransgender,"Little about me being trans makes sense, I'm still scared and confused.","Before I was 12, I was fine with being male. I wasn't upset about any of the changes that came with puberty, but then suddenly I became obsessed witb the idea of a female version of my self, probably stemming from some kind of autophillic attraction to my own body. I started thinking about being transgender, and that soon spiraled into this.

From what I've seen most trans people have problems with a mental map of their body, which makes them transgender or something along those lines. I just kinda dislike a few things a bit, and that might just be because I know they might stop me from passing in the future.

A few things make me think I might just be a crossdresser/autogynephile, such as the fact that I sometimes get aroused by crossdressing, and that when I see people talking about people saying that trans people should just stop caring about gender roles and they're just feminine men/masculine women I get a very strong emotional feeling that I find hard to describe. I'm not sure if it's a bad feeling or a good feeling, but I felt a similar feeling when my mother told me that I had shown no feminine traits when I was young, but that feeling felt much worse and made me cry and almost phyically hurt.

The idea of not being trans and being seen as male when I grow up makes me uncomfortable, although this could just be because of society's view of men, and from what I've heard about hormones and their effects I think I'd be willing to take them."

Mr_Floop,asktransgender,Looking for some Help with Anxiety and Fears as HRT start date nears,"Hello, I am new to this subreddit and for the most part new to Reddit as a whole, but I have silently browsed this subreddit for a very long time and have found respite in the answers to questions others have asked, and I figure it is time to finally say hello and hopefully get some help with my issues as well, so here we go~

Basically I was born and raised in Texas, land of the not so LGBT, home of the Bigots (for the most part where I grew up) and since I was very young had to suppress any weird feelings I had, and was forced into the generic 'boy' life i.e signed up for sports I didn't want to play, wasn't allowed out of boy scouts, and had a fairly abusive childhood for the cherry on top. During middle school years I had gotten a lot more into the internet and was already tech savvy, and began to look into my hidden feelings, knowing there had to be other AMABs feeling the same way, somewhere. And I was right, and sadly also read that starting HRT at a young age was basically the dream, however in my situation it was a dream that would haunt to this day, knowing I could never even think to do such a thing. This led to me repressing all of my feelings and thoughts into the darkest corner of my mind I could find, still being envious and awestruck at girls in my class and women, desiring to be like them, dress like them, and just overall be able to be feminine. I would hang out with them much, much more than any boys at my school, and in high school I began to start separating myself as the school began to get more and more LGBT hating as all of my classmates aged. I got into Illustration and got pretty good at it, and currently have the privilege to attend the College for Creative Studies in Michigan on scholarship, which...is a totally different world than Texas. 

Being in this school has been the first time I've come out to anyone ever, and it only took 2 weeks to feel comfortable enough to do so, I've since come out to my girlfriend of 4 years, and even my abusive hyper-religious bigot-all-my-life parents, who took a 180 and have been super supportive. Since, I've built a massive support group around me in one semester and they even use my preferred name and pronouns perfectly without a single hiccup, its just a good environment for me. Furthermore a trans friend I met here introduced me to a local clinic with a great team of doctors and therapists, who get a lot of charitable donations to help LGBT people in the area get whatever care they need, at no cost to them, and subsequently I got on the tract to start HRT this friday (2/10), and everyone there was so caring and loving, and this entire past half year has felt like a dream, everything went so smoothly and perfectly, and has been the best I've felt my entire 18 years of living...and yet, I am absolutely, utterly, terrified.

I feel like this should just be an ""all systems go, full throttle!"" situation, I mean this is the dream, right? But yet as every day ticks closer to the start date, and every day since I've let out my Dysphoric thoughts out of the depths of my mind, I've felt worse and worse. I feel like this isn't really what I should be doing, like I am not worth the time. I worry about things ranging from if I were to be slated to get my dream drop at Blizzard Entertainment, would me being trans kill that dream, can I afford to get to where I want to be with my transition, will I be able to pass as a woman, and not forever as someone stuck in a transitional phase. I also worry that I am living in a false bubble at this school, with everyone being so caring and loving and accepting of me being who I am, and fear that the second I leave this school its metaphorically moving back to Texas, where its time to pack up all my thoughts and hide them because nobody is going to tolerate me being who I really am. I mean I have worried about every little thing down to am I too tall to be a woman and wear heels (5' 10"") to will I be able to get the feminine voice I desire, and I know these are selfish thoughts and I should be ashamed to think them but I do, and every little thought has surmounted to a gargantuan fear of taking this step, HRT.

I also have a large fear of being stuck, too trans to run back to being a man, but not transitioned enough to get to where I want to be, a woman. What toll will aging take on me, will I be comfortable with that by then? Furthermore recently the ideas that plagued me when I was younger, the idea of ""hitting reset"" and what I thought would be rolling the dice for a new life where I was born female, have come back in tsunami waves, stemming purely from my fears I have listed and many I have forgotten that will probably come back later tonight. I am really not sure what to do, and am not really sure what I am hoping to get out of anyone willing to listen to this long rant, but I really hope you all can help me and make me feel like I'm not on an island here, because right now it feels like every trans person I know is so solid on their choices and nothing is stopping them, and here I am doubting everything, like I'm not trans 'enough' to transition and I don't deserve to start HRT with these doubts.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, whatever this rambling is, and I look forward to any responses you take the time to write as I near closer to the day I'm supposed to start HRT, it is greatly appreciated!

I literally see no point in living, in life or anything.  I want to transition, but it's impossible without money, support or anything at all.  In the UK its either go private (which is expensive) or wait years on end for the free (NHS) health care. 



I don't give a shit about sixth form, my a levels, future careers, all I care about in life is transitioning (or lack of). I've pretty much been told that I'm going to be kicked out soon, but I don't care anyway. 



All I do is sleep nowadays, I don't care about anything else. I start sixth form at 9am, most days I only have 2 lessons so I finish at 11am, I come home and go back to sleep until 6pm. All I do at the weekends is sleep. I skip lessons, I've not even completed anything since I started, and I'm pretty much guaranteed to fail anyway. 


If I don't get to transition in the next year or so I doubt I will be alive this time next year. 



The trouble is that knowing its possible to transition, but knowing I can't is what's causing these thoughts. If I can't transition, why live? I've been pretending to be a cis guy for too long now. I've been lying to everyone, my parents and teachers ask what's up with me, I've been telling them I'm completely fine, but in reality I'm not. I don't want to upset anyone. 



I'm just considering DIYing it, I don't care if it's bad for me. I might be able to get the money to do it for a few months, but that's it. But that means I won't be able to have kids in the future. 





What the fuck am I supposed to do? Just end it all? That honesty seems the best option.

LangMeYourLight,asktransgender,Parents okay with hormones but occasionally try to talk me out of it. Any advice?,"I occasionally get this:

""Why do you need to modify your body?  You can just dress differently, wear falsies/silicone inserts, soften your voice, put on makeup, and put on a wig if you ever go bald!""  

I've seen pictures of no-hormone trans women before.  Though I respect their decision, it does not seem like something I would want to do.  With a small handful of exceptions, they were wearing 20 pounds of makeup and had obviously male body shapes (i.e., flat chest and angular face).  Contrast that with the beautiful trans women who have been on hormones for months or years.  

I don't want falsies and butt pads.  I want the real deal.  

Also, I absolutely HATE the feeling of testosterone going through my veins.  It makes my head cloudy and dampens any happiness and sadness I am feeling.  I feel like I'm seeing the world though a red lens when it rages.

Combine that with the aging effects of testosterone, which I'm ultimately trying to nuke.  My forehead alone is a lot more angular than it was just six months ago.  My voice is sounding more ""buzzy"" than it did just a year ago.  And my skin is already starting to look like my dad's.  

They say they support my adult decision, and are willing to pay.  But I still don't really know what to say when they suggest this ""alternative route"" of life as a ""cross-dresser."""

Cheekbones_Kate,asktransgender,Breast Augmentation,"I'm in the process of planning Breast Augmentation. I'm a bit concerned about the appearance afterwards. 

Many of the post BA pics for transwomen look quite aesthetically poor.  From the side they look stuck on like a D shape, even when unsupported by a bra. I know there are teardrop implants but everywhere I'm looking doesn't recommend them for transwomen because of the slippage and rippling risk. 

Does anyone know if the D shape look goes away to form a natural shape? Would I have to go big for that to happen? I'm pretty flat to begin with and on the lower end of my BMI. Ideally I don't want to go big, would rather be a nice A or B so I'm not too top heavy.

catfusion,asktransgender,"""It's Just A Phase...""/""They'll grow out of it.""","So we hear this kind of thing in relation to the gender expression of young kids who turn out to be trans, but does _anyone_ know of any actual cases where a child persistently and pervasively asserts that they're a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth for say, a few years, and then on day goes, 'Oh, no, changed my mind, childish caprice, you were right, I'm really a boy.""

I get her point, and it could be interesting to have another ""proof"" that I do want to transition, but I'm really afraid of their potency.  
I do have social anxiety, I am pessimistic and sometimes believe I fail everything I try, and to be honest I hate myself at times. But it's definitely not to the point where I would try to harm myself or feel suicidal, where antidepressants seem to be appropriate for those serious issues.

Also I'm afraid it will numb myself to the point where I will just content myself with how I am and prevents me to go further. Or completely mess myself with thoughts I didn't have in the first place...

throwawaythankyou123,asktransgender,Why is the semantic argument offensive?,"Full disclaimer, I believe anyone should be able to dress, act, or use whatever restroom makes them most comfortable. Ultimately, I don't treat men, women, or those who identify as neither any differently from one another. 

I can only speak for myself, but I tend to agree with Richard Dawkins that gender essentially boils down to the chromosomes' one is born with. How someone chooses to identify, on the other hand, is semantic. 
(http://planettransgender.com/richard-dawkins-insults-transgender-community/) 

The argument I have is that while society tends to ascribe genders to things like colors, toys, activities, and more, but that's merely a societal expectation from our culture. If I had a son (or daughter) who wanted people to use female pronouns or loved glittery pink shoes, I wouldn't get in her way. I'd support her, because I'd just want her to be happy. I'd use female pronouns out of courtesy, but ultimately, she'd still have Y chromosomes. 

Furthermore, in many civilizations ""feminine"" activities included roles which are ""masculine"" today, and vice versa. Ex: Amazonian women or eunuch guards. When I shared this opinion with one of my close friends who identifies as a man, and recently started undergoing hormone treatment, I could tell that I basically destroyed our long standing friendship. It's not my intention to do that to anyone here, but I don't understand how I offended him or how I'm even wrong. "

Futurist110,asktransgender,Are these feelings an embodiment of gender-fluidity?,"Basically, I've struggled with my gender for years by now (of course, I also have more pressing problems and issues to worry about right now--especially what looks like some kind of dysautonomia). However, what I am curious about is this:

Sometimes--indeed, often--I have thoughts along these lines: What clothes would I want to wear if I was a girl? What would my sexuality and sexual preferences be if I was a girl? What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

Anyway, could I be gender-fluid? Specifically, are all of these feelings of mine an embodiment of gender-fluidity on my own part?

Or are all of these feelings simply a case of my (likely) dysautonomia--specifically with my brain playing some kind of trick on me?

Any thoughts on this?"

I was planning to start AA a few months before E, with low doses for both, and then work my way up. However I know that every dosage change can cause another round of instability, so is that a bad idea? Is it better to just rip the bandaid off?

I am seriously considering transition, and I know there are people in my life who will no longer associate with me. The worst one for me, is my SO, who at the beginning of our relationship was bisexual, but over time it seems that they have become more and more heterosexual, to the point that they don't think our relationship can continue if I go through with transition. If it seemed like they would be able to end this relationship in a healthy way, I would accept this, but our last few conversations about transition have turned into her worrying that she won't have any reason to live without me. I want to be able to do what I need to do for myself, but with her acting like this I don't know how I can do it without making her depression even worse than it already is. I know she's not just using this as a way to change what I choose, as she has a history of depression and has attempted suicide in the past.

greenarj,asktransgender,My body changed dramatically during transitioning and not in a way I would have expected,"In not necessarily a good way either. I guess this is kind of hard for me to talk about. It's still a bit confusing to me and kind of painful, but at the same time I also wonder if anyone can relate to it.

I was always the tall (well, maybe not, 5'10''), skinny guy (150lb) in high school. I could eat anything and everything and gain virtually no weight. Pizza, fries... whatever. I never tried to eat a whole lot of junk, but I didn't hold back too much either. Nothing seemed to phase me. I had bouts of depression and was even prescribed meds which had a chance of weight gain but... nothing (if anything I lost weight).

I started HRT in my mid-twenties. I didn't notice anything unusual until I was about eight months in.

""Huh, I'm ten pounds heavier. Well, I guess that's water retention or something""

Things started to get a bit more hectic in my life after that. I went full time and met new people, struggled to find a decent job in a different states, struggled with depression, etc. At the back of my mind I guess I might have noticed my weight going steadily up but I found it easy to keep making excuses for myself since so many things were happening. 

It's this, it's that, it's natural to gain something, it's only temporary, once you sort things out it'll all be fine again...

It wasn't until I went back to where I used to live and met someone (who knew I was trans) that they expressed shock at just how fat I'd become. And then... god, it was obvious. I was *huge*. 

In just under three and a half years I'd gone up to 285lb.  

I guess I passed, since close friends I met since my last move seemed surprised when I first told them I was trans, but I passed as a *fat* ciswoman. That hit me like a hammer, because in my head I'd always imagined transitioning into a slim, beautiful woman. The idea that I was in a big body and possibly permanently was psychologically difficult to take.

It's been almost two years since then and despite pushing myself to exercise more than I have in a long time I've hardly seen the scales move. Worse, as soon as I slip back a bit in my diet the weight comes surging back on and I seem to be right back to where I started from. It's dispiriting, especially since I know how thin I used to be and how goddamn *easy it was*.

Even today I'm a bit confused about how things changed, especially since I can't remember ever eating excessively and I tried to keep exercising even when I felt like crap. 

How much would HRT have had to do with this? Maybe I just drew a genetic shit straw (my sisters and mom are all big women who struggle with their weight too). Maybe that's just how I am now too. I guess I got big boobs from it, but just about everything else is big about me too..."

Dustman28,asktransgender,Pros and Cons of bottom surgery? NSFW,"So I'm AMAB and planning out my transition path for the future. I have done a lot of research on the basics, but wanted to reach out to others. I'm not concerned with costs or doctors in this for now, just how it all comes together in the end.

A bit of background on myself, I am strongly attracted to women and feel comfortable moving into a lesbian trans women identity as I progress. I know that sexuality changes can happen as I become more in tuned to my body, but I just don't see myself going overboard for men in my future. I plan to get FFS, HRT and other feminization treatments.

 I am impartial to my penis, I don't like it mostly because of ED problems and not because it feels wrong. I consider it to be a pretty appealing organ when it does work, but it does make hiding it a choir. I mostly want the testosterone factories removed to stop future damages.

With that said I am considering SRS and changing out the plumbing all together. I have always wanted to have a vagina and have found myself fantasizing about one for a long time. It would make passing easier and given my job and geography, it may be physically safer for me too. My biggest concern is more along the lines of complications and pleasing another woman. (I also don't do anal before I get that argument or questions somewhere.) 

So questions:

1. Would SRS be worth it for a trans lesbian who would like, but may not need it?

2. If the answer is no, how is functioning after an orochi? Do you feel that was enough?

3. Is there really any difference between SRS, GRS, Gender Confirmation Surgery or any of those others? They just seem like the same thing, if they are, is there one name that everyone tends to prefer?"
s-trans,asktransgender,The Placebo effect and HRT,"Lurking on here for a couple of years, I've heard people say a lot about HRT (MtF). Everything from your sense of smell getting better to experiencing period-like symptoms once a month. And while those are more drastic examples, I've always been hopefull in regards to some of the more debateable changes.

So when I started hormones three months ago, I approached it a little skeptically. Overall, I don't feel super different.

I mean, yeah, there's some stuff. I cry more easily, all my emotions have sorta had the volume turned up, softer skin, and of course boobs. And all that stuff is *great*. I'm feeling more comfortable every day. 

But I hear stories of people getting straight up euphoria a couple of hours after taking hormones, and having their sexuality change.

Obviously there's plenty of variables here, like how my body is personally handling the hormones, my dosage (4mg e 200mg spiro), that it's only been three months, and that I'm relatively young (19).

But while I'm sure these things play a big role, I'm still... skeptical.

I suspect if you *think* hormones are going to turn your life around, they will. If you expect better sense of smell, sexuality change, and period cramps, you're gonna get them. 

So I kinda wanted to open up a debate about what's fact here, what's not, and the overlap. If these things have happened to you and in what amount of time.

tl;dr How much of HRT is placebo and how much is actually physiological?"

ANYWAYS, I don't know how to find what to wear. I am pretty sure that I am supposed to have a dress shirt and suit jacket, but I have none of that. I don't have much money, and I don't know what to look for. Any ideas?"
andrgynthrowwy26,asktransgender,I'm an androgyne who prefers trans women to cis women for their INNER qualities. Am I a chaser?,"Hi all!

I mostly live my life as a bisexual cis man, but for the past year or so, I've been thinking about my gender identity and realized that from my childhood onwards, I always had a penchant for certain feminine qualities in myself, and never really thought the same way as other cis boys, and I preferred girls as friends, not boys.

I also occasionally wore my mom's clip-on earrings and experimented with painting my nails, putting on make-up, and putting a maxi pad in my underwear, but my father once caught me with the earrings and looked at me bewildered, started shouting and threatened to beat me up if I continue this, so I locked this part of myself away in my mind, only daring to present as a woman on the internet.

I very much enjoyed last year's Halloween, because I painted my nails and wore a permed hair wig as part of my costume and no one batted an eye.

So lately, I've been reading a lot about transgenderism on the internet, and I discovered that I would like it, if I had a somewhat tomboy-ish female body with female genitals, but I would rather identify as an androgyne than as a woman, and would prefer to be referred to with female pronouns and I would like a feminine name.


Now, to the potentially ""chaser-ish"" part:

Based on my experiences on the internet, I feel that I could only imagine a trans woman as a long-term partner, not a cis woman. Since they were brought up as boys when they were children, I feel that we would have much more in common, than with a cis woman, and because of their place in the more controversial part of the LGBT community, they would generally have more progressive, liberal and tolerant worldviews. Also, I have found much more trans women on the internet, who share my interests and hobbies (natural sciences and electronics) than cis women.
I realize that much of what I just said can be perceived as very stereotypical, but these are the experiences I so far got from the internet.

I wouldn't care if my trans partner had a penis or a vagina, I'm comfortable with both types of genitals on my partner.


Now, I have noticed that in the trans community, there is a term called ""chaser"" used for cis men, who are fetishistically attracted to mostly pre-op trans women and objectify them for sexual fullfillment, because of this trans women are usually highly suspicious of men who exclusively seek out trans women as partners.


Do you think I fit this ""chaser"" label? How do you feel about me?"

Do you have any other recommendations? And what was your workout plan like?"
ThrowawayButNotTaken,asktransgender,Facial hair suddenly two different colors? Will I need electrolysis?,"I'd never noticed this before, but I hadn't shaved in a few days (I'm not presenting as female yet) in order to look at how my laser hair removal was coming along (I've had two sessions so far). I noticed the expected patches of removed hair on my neck, along with all dark hair on my neck and jaw. However, all the hair on my cheeks and chin are super pale, with no transition in between! The light hair is just as stubbly as the dark hair, color aside. 

I always thought that my facial hair was all dark, just like my actual hair. Maybe I just haven't noticed all this time? Or is it possible that this is an effect of the laser and the now-light hairs will fall out? It's also possible this is a result of HRT, which I've been on for four and a half months now, or that there were always both but the dark hairs fell out. I'm just so confused!

I'm worried that this means I'll need a lot more electrolysis than I originally hoped. I was hoping to get down to a few hairs that I could zap with electrolysis, but if this hair can't be hit by lasers I'll have hours and hours more electrolysis than I hoped...

Does anyone else have this experience?"

melynda12,asktransgender,"Uhm, just came out to my mom","Heya, so i came out to my mom about 3 hours ago. Wasnt really planned either, i have been writing a letter for so long trying to make it perfect etc but never got 100% happy with it. Anyway, i've been having the crappiest day ever and felt down, and my mom randomly came into my room asking if i was alright, for some reason this just triggered something i started crying for the first time in years, i couldn't controll it and she kept asking whats wrong you can tell me anything and so on, i really couldnt speak but honestly something inside me just went well here goes nothing, i'll never find the perfect moment anyways. I showed her the letter aswell as we spoke face to face, to my surprise she didn't even get the slightest bit upset, like not at all! More the opposite, she got super happy and went more or less '' Finally, your sister and i have been waiting for you to come out when you feel ready for years now!'' I mean i'm aware i've been giving small hints or not really hidden it but didn't expect this, she kept going on how much she supports me and will help me through this, and my sister and her will have my back no matter what, and shes aware i'm throwing myself out there for abuse, loss of friends, possible relatives taking distance and she told me it would be quite the change and she will missgender me but will try to do her best and will eventually learn. But she promised that they'd always stay by my side which made me so happy! She also explained that literally my entire family (Mom,Sis,Brother,Dad, even grandma) Had kind of known i've had my own femenine wardrobe, make up and stuff like that. My brother isnt fond of it, but not against it. (From what i'm told). I'm going to speak to my siblings in private later when i feel ready to have the talk again. Also i havent even spoken to my dad in probably 5-6 Years because of stuff that happened when i was younger, but mom and him held contact and they've knewn about this since i was in my early teens apparently. I'm still really shaky and it all feels so weird, but in a good weird way? Can't really explain it. I also feel 50 pounds lighter like a big rock fell from my stomach which is an amazing feeling!

But now i'm stuck with this other feeling ''Now what?'' What do i do now? No hormones untill summer, do i start dressing the way i've been doing in private infront of my mom right away? Do i do it gradually? So many questions! I don't wanna come off to quickly from boy &gt; girl overnight, i'm far ahead in all of this compared to my mother, i've been living as a woman as often as i can in private for years and shes never seen it.

PS. Living alone with my mom since both my siblings moved out recently.

And sorry this isnt really a question, just super happy about this :D"

verb-todisposeof,asktransgender,what are the added complexities of dating for a trans person?,"So, sorry about the throwaway, but I'm just not sure how the community here would react to my concerns and thought I'd protect my main account from potential negative response, I just want to hear some honest opinions and learn some.

 I thought of this because recently I hit the tinder swiped a few times and came across a cute woman and read her profile, she is a trans woman, she's right out with it, OK no problem shes a cute girl who seemed interesting so I swipe ok, we match. Awesome, I send out out a message and we get to talking. She seems nice, we share some interests, messages back and forth for a few hrs, she went to bed, I gave her my number.

 Now this interaction got me to thinking, I've interacted with trans people in just life, and maybe more passing who I never knew about, but I don't know any personally so I guess I've never considered this struggle for them, but I can't help but think dating must be harder for transgender people. for instance (and I know I'm thinking way ahead of myself) lets say things go well with this girl from tinder, there's dates and and we like each other and seem like compatible people, but then it turns out she has a penis. I might really like her, but that's not something that appeals to me and sexual compatibility is a major part of a relationship. Aside from that lets say that's not an issue, and this is one I feel really scummy about because I've always considered myself quite the feminist so thinking this made me feel like a hypocrite, but if I was to date a trans woman, what would my friends and family think.I know my friends would judge any girl I introduce to them, and be appropriately honest with me in private with their opinions (sometimes when you have those rose colored glasses you need a friend who can say, dude shes not for you). and I think they wouldn't hold anything against her for being trans most of my friends aren't jerks, but I wonder if it would change their perception of me in the back of their mind. Same for family, but I'm not sure they'd be so accepting, probably most of them would think it's gay, and really that is a tough hurdle to cross having family members perception be that. So I feel bad about having these concerns, because I've always thought everyone should be who they are as long as it's a good person, and I've always considered that if the person you are is a man or woman, then that's how I should treat you I as regardless of the features you're born with, I've always done it on the small scale, be respectful, use the right pronouns, be inclusive, and all that, but now confronted with a mere remote possibility of a more intimate involvement on that personal level, I find myself considering this girl differently that I would where she assigned her actual gender, because honestly she seemed nice and I know if she was cis I wouldn't question whether I wanted to pursue anything, I'd be looking for a good chance to ask her out.

 So while I figure this out for me, I figure that a lot guys just wouldn't consider a trans woman just swipe left and then there's those hurdles to get over for guys that do. So it must be hard to date as a trans person since your chance of finding a partner without these hangups who isn't a chaser (I did a bit of search before posting) isn't great, and I'd like to know what problems and hurdles and complexities do you have to deal with dating as a trans person (I imagine peoples perceptions mostly)? any stories as to how you handle them? Even if nothing comes from meeting this girl on tinder I'm glad it made me open my eyes and take a look at myself and my perceptions."
Dragoic,asktransgender,Could use some help,"Where to start.

So since i was 15 have i envied females that they had it all and i was just stuck with whatever i was left with. I would from time to time go to bed sad and wishing that the next day i would wake up as the opposite sex. But to even more disappointment to wake and just be the same. Time went by and due to a rather homophobic family started i to think that what i felt was just wrong and it was just not meant to be and it was just something that would pass. My smile went, emotions died slowly and everything just seemed pointless, ive even had moments where i just hoped my life would just stop and ill vanish from existence.

I was already the very quiet boy in class and never liked to take photos. It have now come to the point where i just hide/avoid photos at all cost. I cant not look at holiday pictures. Just to upload a profile picture of myself to facebook was hard and ive deletede it several time due to just getting depressed looking at it. 

To jump to current state. After years of suppressing it did i 08/02-2017 (Wednesday) just collapse into sadness. Every thing with me was dead and living on so emotionless frustrated me. In that moment did i also went on a spree to find a solution and i researched as much as i could around the trans subject. For the first time in such a long while did i feel joy. I could do anything. I saw myself someone else that could smile without washed-out feelings or had to feel like faking it and a constant need to just push myself to forward each day.

But it didnt last. The next day came the doubts, and with it the ""what the hell am i doing"". I could not sleep out of fear of what could go wrong and if i lied to myself. So it went on with good and bad moments. To put myself in a point of view did i feel like a dog that waited for its owner to throw the ball. But instead of throwing the ball does the owner just fake it and i would just sprint around confused and desperate to find the ball. For the feeling was there but where had it gone? 

In an last attempt did i sought a doctor at the beginning of the next week. Explained everything, just to say have ive never opened up to a stranger in person before about something like this. Since he was not an expert on the matter did he send me forward to someone to deal with this

Now i just try to keep myself positive and keeps trying to find that feeling i had for just that short time. But doubt keep getting stronger and i question myself more each passing day. 

So now im just feeling like im making a fool out of myself. Ive talked to my friends about it too and they support me if this is what i choose."

AvaCasey,asktransgender,Is it normal for my personality to change this much from mtf HRT?,"So heres my observation, I've been on HRT for 4 months now and I have noticed that my interests in media (music, TV, news politics) is changing to a very large degree.

I used to be huge into heavy metal music and I got a huge amount of pleasure from listening to it, now for some reason I don't get the same pleasure from it and This has only really become apparent in the past 3 months or so, I seem to be drawn to more easy to listen to music such as classical, atmospheric electronic music, and ugh, hate to admit this, but even some pop. 

My taste in TV and movies has also shifted though not to the same degree, I seem to enjoy more episodic comedies now instead of series with long plots that continue for several episodes, I still love anime though my taste in anime has moved more towards the slice of life direction and away from the serious plot driven shows I used to watch a lot of. 

Lastly I don't seem to enjoy using my computer as much as I used to, I used to play on my lappy all day every day though now I want to leave the house all of the time weather permitting and I seem to shun long term computer usage.

Could all of this be changing due to my HRT meds? 

I've also noticed that in many ways I'm not just visibly turning into a girl, I'm acting like one too even in public and I don't even realize i'm doing it, nor is it something i'm actually trying to do. The inflection in my voice has changed, my body language is more female, and I sit naturally cross legged. 

I love every minute of HRT but these things are things I didn't really expect to happen, at least not this soon, could the HRT be causing this massive shift?

I feel like I'm a totally different person from who I was just 6 months ago."
DaveyDevil,asktransgender,"Even when I try, I just can't spit out my gender problems to my therapist.","New account cause I can't remember my old trans related throwaway account.  
  
For several years, I've been working up the courage and actual accessibility to see a therapist to talk about gender issues. Like, for three years I've been actively questioning and it's really fucking intense to talk about. I just keep thinking, ""how could I *possibly* think I'm a man in a woman's body? That's fucking ridiculous bullshit."" Every time I think about it, I feel overwhelming embarrassment, anxiety, and depression. I am actually drunk as I'm typing this because I don't think I can write this out sober. I'm terrified.  
   
And that's my problem. Now that other life problems like moving and new job and insurance have been sorted out, I got in touch with a social worker who just referred me to a psychiatrist to see me about my mood problems. I've been put on antidepressants and my social worker suggested a minimum diagnosis of adjustment disorder. I told her about my episodes; I told her I felt like an impostor in my own body and lost in sense of self. She described them as being that of depersonalization. At one point, she asked me if my discomfort and stress had anything to do with gender, and I freaked out and just muttered, ""Idon'tknow"".  
  
I *know* I shouldn't be doing this. I should just come out and say it, lay it flat on the table like I've wanted to do for the past three years. But it's so fucking hard. It took me two years and several shots JUST to have the courage to order a binder online, for god's sake. ~~Then realizing it didn't fit and that I would have to exchange it gave me a motherfucking panic attack, literally.~~ I get on the verge of tears just thinking about it (though maybe that's the gin talking) and I have no clue how to disclose my secret while sober. I can't spit it out.  
  
I have an appointment tomorrow and I'm panicking. I want to tell her what's going on, but I pussy out every time. Have you gone through this, too? Tell me how to snap out of the cowardice and just say it. I've been bottling it up for years and it seems fucking impossible.

Exact7ly the thing. So why go on hormones? Yep, I thought it was worth the hell it unleash. No. No. No. Wrong. So wrong.

UnknownSpecimen97,asktransgender,Did anyone else experience exhaustion after starting HRT? (MTF),"It's been almost 3 weeks since I started estrogen, everything has been well so far, including the breast pains (ouch though).

However the only thing that's been bothering me is the exhaustion, I'm almost constantly tired, I take more naps now than ever and sometimes sleep for over 10 hours.

Apparently this is pretty normal in the early stages, but I was wondering if it goes away eventually? I'm tired of being tired lol."
mrlanon,asktransgender,Estrogen effects?,"So I know that's there's information out there on the effects of estrogen, but I was rather curious to specifics for me.


First a very brief background:


I got accepted into a clinic in the Netherlands. However I am now in gridlock due to my mother not accepting the terms they lay upon her. The term that is most relevant is supporting me, which she can't due to her moral compass. On other fronts she's supportive(school, leaving the home, food, et cetera). I'll be doing exams soon and will leave the home at around June-September. 

**Main Question:**
&gt;Now to escape the gridlock and to make sure that I didn't do anything stupid(I suffered from very dark intrusive thoughts) I ordered cyproterone sacrificing some money in the process. I built up quite a lot of it however so that isn't a concern. I started on 12,5mg and told the situation to the people that were relevant(GP, Youth Care helper, dad). Now I bumped it up to 25mg and I ordered some estrogen(3 packs of 84 x 2mg progynova(order requirements affected the amount I bought)). Now that I am waiting for it to arrive I was wondering what the effects would be on me for the long-short term. I know it's hard to lay a finger on, but based on my [appearance](http://i.imgur.com/ZZF2LBZ.jpg) and ([ver with no makeup](http://i.imgur.com/lUSWlwj.jpg)) and the light gynecomastia I have can some sort of estimate be made? I am also 17 if age is relevant.

This is mostly to anticipate how I will have to deal with the situation going forward. Being able to anticipate onset times and whatnot helps with my mother and me and the clinic. Dose wise I am planning on using 4mg. My GP said although he has to comply with his expert protocol(a.k.a not giving me meds until the VUmc says otherwise) I can get blood tests. He'll also consult and endocrinologist(speaking off I should probably inform him about the E and the increase in AA by calling). I'll see him in two weeks to ask further questions and to provide explanations. 




As to how it gets me out of gridlock? Well it has a lot to do with how the VUmc(the clinic) works and of course I'll need assistance(youth care assistant, my father) to take control over my transition. I also kinda *need* it to keep the intrusive thoughts away. Not so much the estrogen, but that's a bargaining chip that also happens to actually transition.

As to why I am just not waiting? Other than the intrusive thoughts that kept worsening overtime which recently creeped into my school performance(not very handy during exams!) and giving me suicidal tendencies(seriously contemplating it) which my psychologist(outside the clinic) is not capable of addressing in any meaningful way currently. I am overal tired of the loose way they have treated me. I got a lot of understanding, but my psychologist at the clinic kept excessively delaying it due to my mother. Which now is 100% not gonna show up to be convinced. As I mentioned the gridlock ends when I break it for them. Which may upset them, but I have little to lose other than a bit of money and for them it's gonna be a bad time. As they've pretty much put themselves into a position where they have to treat me and have control over the transition. Finally the blood test will be visible on my medical dossier. Which is in turn visible to the VUmc and my mom if she want to look at it for some reason so there's no point hiding it.

I am posting this here as /r/TransDIY and any other relevant subs are a bit too specific. 


(Side note: I think the intrusive thoughts are mostly worsening(as I've had them before) because off Dysphoria fueled Dysmorphia mixed with the ones relating to the tensions that I've had with my mother).

If you got this far reading I'd like to say thanks for reading through this wall(when I say ""brief"" it *always* ends up being gigantic).

Per the title, I'm having MtF GRS with Dr. Bowers in April, and am currently booking my flights.  We live in Phoenix, so it's only about a 2 hour flight to San Francisco.  In the past, I've been advised to splurge on the return flight and go first class for the extra room- but, given the relative briefness of the flight, is it worth it? Or will sitting in economy 10 days post-op be something that most people can tough out for 2 hours?

Kavik_Ryx,asktransgender,Transitioning during university. Experiences coming out to colleagues.,"Ever since moving for my Master's Degree, I have felt more comfortable in coming to terms with my gender. It is my goal to explore my gender as I consider whether I wan't to transition or not. Slowly I am coming with my friends, though this is not known by any member of the school faculty. Though it's early enough that I'm not compelled to present as feminine all the time yet, I don't want to be living some double life where I am a woman around my friends, but switch back to a man for lectures and research. My university is in a very small town, which also means that if I am wearing a dress while shopping or at the post office, I am liable to run into a professor one day. Given where I am, I'm not scared of being ostracized because of it. But it doesn't feel comfortable yet to come out to anybody yet, which I'll have no choice if I transition. Even then, I'm not sure the best way to go about it.

What have people's experience been with coming out to their institution, their professors, and advisors, and what has been helpful in finding a way that feels appropriate and non-compromising?"

As in just plain dumb, as they clearly come from an unhealthy mind devoid of reason (or reasonableness). Also notice the number of assumptions he makes (eg: what he thinks I'm seeking from him or my mother) and that he is making the whole situation about himself and how *he* feels *my* transition is affecting *him*. 

I should add that in the end I'm glad that I read them, as my imaginings of them were far worse than the reality. And while my stepfather's posts are obnoxious and offensive, I am in a place where such things do not really concern me (even though they are quite draining). In fact, I jokingly asked my sister (an ally) why my stepfather was checking out my arse so much. No really, why is he so obsessed with my arse???

Anyway, here a couple of my stepfather's messages (cut &amp; pasted with name changes/edits for anonymity):


***START***

&gt;STEPFATHER (email 1): 

Hi [my father's name]

The final words with your son-ish, he doesn't want me to send any more communications to him so it's you I'm afraid. 

I suspect he is frustrated because [their mother] won't have some deep and meaningful conversation about his cross dressing. Effects of hormone replacement therapy possibly too. We aren't happy about it and don't want to talk to him about it, if it's a bedroom thing then leave it in the bedroom. We've got zero interest in what happens in other people's bedrooms. I usually find that if you give someone enough rope they will hang themselves anyway, we are all our worst enemies. 

Get Mat or Matara or what ever he's called nowadays off his ever increasingly fat arse and get his head read, HRT doing something to his brain.

-----------------------------------------
&gt;MY FATHER'S REPLY: 

[name of stepfather],

Today I found the two emails you sent me on [date]. They had ironically found their way into my junk file which, I regret to say, is the only place for them.
 
I cannot believe that someone I held in some regard and respect, is capable of writing what you wrote. What you said was gratuitous and deeply offensive. If [my child] had written a similar email to your late father about you, I would have been equally appalled – but I know that [they] would be incapable of doing so. Up until today, I would have believed the same about you.
 
Your total lack of understanding about [their] situation is stunning and your coarse frivolity about it is shameful.
 
I’m assuming that [their mother] has never seen any of the material you have written about [them]. But since you have felt free to send them to me, you may be insensitive enough to show them to her. I hope you have not.

-----------------------------------------
&gt;STEPFATHER (email 2):

Whatever, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. You really spend time going through your Spam folder? WTM time on your hands. No one could have offended my father with any aspect of my life as he was fully aware of it, nothing hidden away in the closet. I guess someone could have made something up but that would be criminal defamation and I would have no hesitation in pursuing the matter.

The truth [of their coming out] is disrespectful and insulting. Sheesh. Surely he is going to have to femanise his name at some point, you are going to introduce a woman as your son? ""Ever increasing fat arse"" is as plain to see as the nose on my face, it's one of the many hormonal effects.

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,Questions concerning Dysphoria and Possibly Trans Tendencies (NSFW),"Recently, I saw a general practitioner to start the referral process of seeing someone like a gender therapist and hell knows I need one but I have some questions about dysphoria and other tendencies and if what I am about to list makes sense for someone who is trans.

* I hate taking off my glasses because it's takes away the only distraction away from my masculine features like my jawlines and brows and I find myself much happier when I feel that my face looks more feminine BUT I am not always bothered by it (which I explain later why I HATE this).

* I can't really say if I have the stereotypical 'gentital' dysphoria, I've found recently now that I've been questioning I hate having erections (yet testosterone makes me love it &gt;:c) and I have tried to tuck (unsuccessfully) as well as I have had passing thoughts of removal or destruction of my genitals but, I don't have a constant HATE of them, mostly because they are small (no shame there) and if I did something drastic, I wouldn't ever be able to have a vagina and finally, I think I've experienced post-coital tristesse for years, maybe even since I first hit puberty but I don't know how much this really means or is it just a common thing?

* I don't like/don't WANT to like my male sex drive, but testosterone doesn't seem to like that type of thinking because it's hard not to think about sex sometimes and unlike a decent amount of people I've seen around here (I know ALOT of people don't do it but there does seem to be enough people to mention it) but I've never already been exposed to trans porn (and still haven't) though I do find myself sticking to places like lesbians and such, though minimally because I avoid masturbation and usually only do it twice a week on average. In addition, most people say they can't do it without imaging their penis as a vagina but it is almost impossible for me to do that, it's just so obvious that I have a penis and I DO hate thinking about PiV sex with me having the penis but it's also almost impossible to imagine myself TRULY being in the female position because my penis is like ""Heeeeeeeeey, I see you there... can't forget about me, just take this testosterone and there won't be any problems, you see?"" and I HATE it, most of the time I am forced (by testosterone) to imagine myself in male position for a second, it's not me, just some random figure that I usually can't see the top half of, because I am legitimately disgusted by the thought of ME, MY body doing something like that.

* I actually HATE myself when I feel fine as well, I am afraid that my transness will just walk up and disappear on me, leaving me cis and it makes me want to have MORE dysphoria so that I can actually constantly feel like I am trans for sure and I can just start making my way to changes. I WANT for it to be clearer to me whether it comes in acceptance/clarity or a crap-ton of dysphoria which I imagine most people would be asking to NOT have, which makes this sound absolutely stupid.

* I look at cis girls with envy but I look at certain cis GUYS with envy to because I think to myself, ""If they transitioned they would turn into a beautiful girl"" as well I look at people and wonder, ""If they were trans, how would I know?"" little to say I pay attention to the faces of each gender and look for similarities and what's different 

* I don't like to see facial hair and I like to see it gone (I look more feminine), but sometimes when I am between shaving it, I'll be feeling it for some reason (only the sideburn area, when I am leaning on my hand) and be like ""I don't know how to feel about this at all..."" and I don't like it.

* Sometimes, in the tiny 'blind' spot of the eye due to the optic nerve, I am convinced, only for a faction of a second that I have more feminine features or slight breasts but then the moment is over and I realize I am just the same as always and I am never really happy when I realize that.

* I don't like my 'moobs' but I don't like them because they remind me how I am just a overweight male who only has them because I wasn't very healthy until I started questioning, not because I don't want breasts.

* I can't provide any reason for why I would want to keep a male body as well, if I had a choice, I don't I wouldn't have reason for either really but, I'd choose female. I would rather see myself with feminine proportions and parts, I don't like my tall and brooding nature, as if I am a Englishman straight out of the nearest pub (I am not dissing Englishmen! Most of my family is English and I am just saying I wouldn't want to be them because ya know, trans :/ but take it as a compliment because I think of them when I think strong masculinity, not saying that they ALL have to be super masculine so yeah...)

* I am scared that I will suppress it all and find myself in my thirties and have it all come up again and I don't want that to happen, I want to do something now, whether it IS HRT or for now therapy. I feel maybe I am too focused on looks and not focused on the social, though, I've never really been social AT ALL.

* Other times, I AM thinking about the social part of transition, I remember how I have never really been masculine and I have never really liked masculine things and now, I just hope that somehow I can morph into a more feminine and considerate person who can actually talk to people once in a awhile.

* Sometimes, I hate listening to my own voice, but sometimes I don't! Which confuses me on why, though I find if I sigh, grunt or anything like that, it's usually much worse and more often it bothers me.

* I prefer to imagine myself as a woman in the future, whether I am daydreaming about world domination, making the entire solar system Canada (Mars being called Dusty Canada) or really anything and it can help to distract me from what I am bothered about with my body, I'd wanna dream about it with me being a woman and I've always thought about transforming into a girl by some scientific or magical (curse) even before puberty.

* I sometimes want my parents to stop saying my given name and male pronouns but I would feel guilty about it because I am just questioning, I would feel weird about it probably and I don't even have something like a name thought up and I think it would be very rude to try and ask for something like that, as well if they say no or wait, I will just feel bad about it and as well I think ""You'll probably just be fine without it, it doesn't REALLLLLLY bother you"" a lot of the time and just stop thinking of it as a possibility besides having a very SLIM idea of what I might like (Josie, Jennifer, Sophie, Sophia, Zara, Veronica) but I don't think any of them could ever fit.

* As I was writing this post, I was talking to my mother and she somehow got to talking about how I have OCD, now I know she means in a minor way if anything, though I highly disagree to that and I find myself angry at the thought because I see a lot of people on this subreddit find that OCD can confuse them with being trans or something and they find themselves not to be trans and I DON'T like the thought of it thus I was not happy to talk about it.

I know it's that there is a lot to respond to I imagine that no one will be able to respond to it all, but whatever you think you can answer I would really appreciate."
lyn46,asktransgender,What's the best delivery method for bio-identical Progesterone?,"I'm mainly just wondering what method shows the best results. I know how injections are the best for estrogen, but I know almost nothing about what methods are available for Progesterone and which are the best. "
whenyesterdaywemet,asktransgender,Finding myself on the gender spectrum,"For a long time, I've questioned my gender, but have never really had any reason to transition. I always come to the conclusion that I don't have gender disphoria, I have being out of shape disphoria, and I am more attracted to women's bodies than men's.

I know I am very aroused by the idea of having a female body, and I enjoy crossdressing occasionally. But, I also find myself attracted to myself when I'm in good shape, or wear clothing which makes me look good in a masculine way. I'm very sexually attracted to women, and have had sexual encounters with women, where the thought of me being a woman never crossed my mind. I sometimes find the thought of making out with a man arousing, but when it comes to sexual acts, or even watching two other men kiss, I'm not very turned on. I know that if I were a woman or transitioned, I would be open to dating men, but would probably still date women for the most part. I know that can change with the hormones.

Functioning in normal society, I'm not ashamed at all of being a man. I enjoy having a deep voice, large muscles, and I like it when people compliment me on those things. I think I would enjoy being complimented on having female characteristics, but it's much easier and less stress on my identity if I just stay in good shape and dress well. Transitioning would be a lot of work, and I would lose relationships with a lot of family and friends. 

My big question is this: often when I'm on subreddits like /r/genderotica, people assume that because you are turned on by the idea of being a woman, you must be a trans person in waiting. I've done a lot of reflection on this, for years, gone to therapists, and talked with actual trans-women about it. When I honestly assess myself, I think I'm just a man who fetishizes the idea of being a woman, and I'm happy with that. I don't find myself lacking anything.

Is there anything wrong with being in this state? Is there any scientific research which shows that men with autogynephilic (I don't mean this in a derogatory way. I simply mean this as short hand for being turned on by the idea of being feminine) tendencies are actually just trans-women waiting to happen, or can I just be happy with where I'm at.

Is there anything wrong with being mostly straight cis-male, but with a few gay tendencies, who is turned on by the idea of being a woman?"
queersparrow,asktransgender,"If you're non-binary or in an in-between space in social transition, how do you navigate gendered public spaces? What about gendered safe spaces?","*Possible TW for talking about experiences in public restrooms.*

So, by gendered public spaces I mean gendered restrooms, locker rooms, fitting rooms, etc, and by gendered safe spaces I'm specifically thinking about safe spaces dedicated to women, but also interested in opinions about safe spaces dedicated to non-binary people.

I'm physically ftm (pre-anything) and my gender presentation has been masculine leaning since before I knew being transgender was even a thing that exists, but as of right now I have no real intentions to transition socially or legally. If I do transition socially, it will likely be to a non-binary place, rather than to the male end of the spectrum. 

Though I've acknowledged my physical dysphoria for a long time now, for the last couple years (since I started reading about transgender experiences) I've really been struggling with my place in relation to trans identity. I've been admitting to myself lately that I value and participate in a lot of women's spaces, and that a not insignificant part of my struggle with identity is the fear of losing those spaces. I know that trans men don't belong in women's spaces (gendered public space, or safe spaces), but I don't know where the line is for non-binary people? 

I specifically have a lot of difficulty with restrooms. I have no dysphoria around using restrooms (since gendering of restrooms is social, rather than physical, it just doesn't bother me), and I use the women's restroom because it's what I'm used to and frankly when I'm traveling in unfamiliar places the men's restrooms scare me. It's not uncommon for women who encounter me in public restrooms to assume I don't belong there; usually this results in stares or whispering to one another, occasionally it results in comments. But I've never felt in any serious physical danger in a women's restroom. On the other hand, there have been plenty of highway rest areas where I felt fear of physical danger just brushing shoulders with some of the men on their way to the men's room at the same time as I headed for the women's room. I've long felt guilty for making women uncomfortable in the women's restroom, but I don't know if that guilt is justified or whether there's something I ought to be doing differently. 

TL;DR - Trans guys: at what point in physical and/or social transition did you vacate women's spaces? Non-binary people: how do you decide which gendered spaces are open to you and which are not? Ladies: how do you feel about people like me (socially female/nonbinary but presenting masculine) using women's public spaces? How do you feel about people like me remaining in women's social safe spaces?

AngstyCanadianTeen,asktransgender,"I went to try to get some help in August, and have so far gotten nothing","I went in to my family doctor to see about finding a gender theripist in August. They said that they would call some places and then get back to me about it.
They didn't get back to me.
I called them in October to check in and they said that they might have found someone, but I needed to get a psychiatric evaluation before this theripist would even see me.
Again, my doctor said they would call some places and get back to me. I called again in November, and they said that they found a place in Toronto that would do a psychiatric  evaluation on my but probably not until I'm 18 which is in April.
Yet again they said they would try and get an apointment for me there and they'd get back to me. I haven't heard anything since.
I've been meaning to call my doctor recently but every time I plan to, I forget or just get too anxious to call.
All this waiting is killing me, and all of this testosterone is destroying my body (maybe it isn't actually but it sure as hell feels like it)

RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,Help with depression.,"So, this is personal, and it's not something I'm posting lightly.  I'm fairly private and I don't generally talk about depression outside of a few close friends and a therapist's office.  Gonna give this a try, though.  I'm a transwoman who isn't presenting female at all.  Been on HRT for over six months, going through professional voice therapy, and getting my beard zapped once a month with really good results so far.

I also have a new job.  I'm a paraprofessional in line for a full time teaching gig in a few years.  Most of the faculty I care about know and I'm out to the relevant assistant principal.  Nothing but support across the board.  Everything is going well for me to begin gradually living as a woman and coming to work as a woman in the fall of 2018.

But I've flamed out into a nasty depression spiral twice in the last month.  This is pretty new for me since I've been relatively stable since beginning HRT.  Not all rainbows and sunshine, but functioning as well as possible while pretending to be a dude.  I mean, I know what it is, but there's little I can do about it.  I end up looking rough enough that not only do faculty take notice, but kids do too.  I have a girl I student taught come in and give me a big hug at the end of each day, and even she asked me what was wrong yesterday.

Most of what's going on is just emotional overreach.  I'm come out to a lot of family, a lot of my colleagues at work, and I've begun all the things I'll need to transition effectively.  I think it's taken a toll, though, and I've done my best to run in neutral for a bit.  It doesn't always work out, though.  I'm even making it a point to unfollow people who post political stuff on Facebook (sorry to any of the transladies who know who I am, it's only temporary and for my mental health).

The other circumstances I really can't do a whole helluva lot about, though.  I visited my mom last weekend, and I mistook her calm demeanor and open acceptance on the phone as us maybe becoming closer and bonding.  Nope, I was flat out told she wasn't going to help me talk to any of her family.  Just sort of reinforces the notion that at this point she only has me around every once in a while because society says she's supposed to.

Likewise, I'm lonely as fuck.  My close friends live out-of-state at this point, and while I'm making friends among my work colleagues I can't rely on them all the time.  They all have their own lives and commitments.  Even my parents and brother aren't around this weekend very much.  It's me and the dogs, and as much as I love the cuddles they suck at conversation.

And the conversation is important.  I'm at the point in my vocal training where we need to begin making it habitual, but as good as a conversationalist as I am even I get tired of yakking to myself.  I need to seriously use it, but there's no one to talk to.

I also made a misstep yesterday in going to my AP and talking to him about what we're going to do in the fall when my hair is longer (and I want highlights, damnit), my beard is even lighter, and my boobs are bigger.  He didn't mean to do it, but he scared the shit out of me when he said the district will likely require a counselor or social worker present and we will likely have to notify parents if we have to have a conversation.  That's just frightening.

So, I have all of the above going for me on a Saturday night I'm staring at my laptop and watching the Blair Witch Project.

Honestly, all I want to do is avoid the depression spirals enough to where I won't look bad to my co-teacher (who is fast becoming a good friend) and hurt my longterm job prospects because I look unstable.

So, any ideas?  Also, sorry for the length."

HauntMex3,asktransgender,"Transguy needs some advice about PCOS. T, Birth control, med interactions, etc!","Hi there! I was recently diagnosed with PCOS. I have an appointment with the endo on March 22, 2017. He has plans to put me on birth control to regulate my menstrual cycle (which is regular, I just get it every two months.).  He knows i am transgender. He stated that I needed the birth control in order to regulate my body since PCOS is A) Messing with my insulin ?? And B) could be causing my uterine lining to get too thick since I don't bleed monthly as normal. I really really don't want to be on birth control since I heard it can cause breast growth, etc.

1) How many months do you think it'd be before I could start testosterone? I don't have any idea how long ""leveling"" my body will take and my ultimate goal is to start testosterone over summer break and live my senior year of highschool fully out as male.

2) Do I REALLY need to be on birth control? 

3) I was told birth control would actually lower the estrogen in my body since my body is currently ""producing more estrogen to keep up."" Is this true? I feel like this was said to swindle and manipulate me on it since my family feels like it'll ""solve"" me being trans. 

4) I take a VERY finnicky mood stabilizer called lamictol. In the directions it says hormone birth control could affect how much of the medication is taken in by my body by making it take in too little or too much. This could possibly be dangerous. Is there any other options besides birth control? And again, do I REALLY need to be put on birth control?

Im sorry is none of this makes sense, i'm kind of freaking out! Any and all advice and knowledge is appreciated, thank you in advance !!!

This is unconstitutional, immoral, illegal, and could be a reality by Friday. 

This is a leaked version of the anti-LGBT executive order that was rumored earlier this week. I'd suspected that the morning announcement of continuing to uphold Obama's LGBT protection EO was just the Trump admin buying time while they hashed out this EO and it seems I may have, been correct.

The article does a great deal of going into the details so I'll spare you a summary here and just say that we are looking at a volatile form of the Religious Freedom Act wrapped up in the form of an executive order with an additional clause that attempts to stipulate that one's original birth certificate is the only legally valid form of gender as applicable to law. You may have already seen my ""biological sex"" post but if not I'll link to it as well if you're not familiar with how the GOP is trying to undermine your efforts to legally change your gender in the eyes of the government.

luciapark95,asktransgender,Any advice for transitioning in South Korea (and many other questions)? Warning - Long Post,"Sorry if the way I'm writing/formatting this post is strange or wrong, I'm new to reddit and this is actually my first post. Anyways, long story short, I'm a 21 year old Korean American doing my undergrad in a small city in South Korea. I've finally come to terms with being a transgender girl and I've decided I want to transition (yay!), but this is already a super hard country to live in for trans people, and it's made even worse by the fact that I'm a foreigner. I would be immensely grateful for any help or advice you all could give me.

Please forgive me for just dumping a laundry list of problems here; this is all happening kind of fast for me and I don't really know what I'm doing. Basically, I want to start DIY ASAP, present male until graduation, and then move somewhere else and start full time as a girl. I know its a vague plan and it looks like I haven't done any research, but I assure you, research is the only thing I've been doing for the past 3 months. A lot of it just doesn't apply to me because of my unique circumstances, and so I've gotten to the point where I really need to ask for help.

These are the current facts of my situation. Since what I've written is quite long and most of it is personal baggage that I needed to get off my chest, I've emphasized the parts that really matter. Hopefully it helps:

* I was disowned by my parents after coming out to them 2 years ago. That is how I was left stranded in a foreign country and struggling to remain financially independent. They thought it would break me and that I would give in to coming back stateside for counseling with the family pastor, but it didn't work and I am no longer on speaking terms with my immediate or extended family. I'm now a full time student working 3 part time jobs to stay afloat in a country whose language is not my own. On the one hand, it's great because I am independent and in control of my own transition. On the other hand, it means that coming out of the closet or trying to do RLE would jeopardize my income and education, which would mean being homeless. **This means the ""legitimate"" route through the Korean medical system, which (to my knowledge) requires RLE prior to HRT, is not an option.** Either way, it would also require me to take a written psych exam to prove I have ""GID"". Since those tests are not administered in English, I would literally have to study for the ""can I transition"" test as if it were one of my Korean language finals. I might be wrong about the RLE requirement, but even then, it's a last resort at best.
* Because of the above problem, DIY is basically my only option. Problem is, **I don't really know how to do DIY in Korea**. I've read a lot about how people do it in the States, but that doesn't really help me. **I have no idea how to do the blood test thing in Korea.** Also, I have no idea about Korean customs and **whether or not they will confiscate prescription meds that are imported from an online pharmacy**. I've heard that I can import up to 3 months worth at a time, but it'd be useful to know if anybody has actually done it successfully. I know its a long shot to ask here, but anyone with experience in this, I would really appreciate some help.
* I'm a sophomore in my university and I'm planning to graduate 1.5 years from now. I don't mind presenting male at school/work until I graduate (in fact, I have to), but I'm wondering about **how much effort would be involved in hiding the changes for that long**. I can get away with a lot of stuff, like baggy clothing and long hair, because most people just chalk it up to me being foreign.
* I live alone with my girlfriend. She has been incredibly supportive and even excited for me. Even if you don't have any advice to give that is relevant to my situation specifically, **I would be equally appreciative of advice on how to be a good partner to somebody who knew me before I realized I was trans**.
* I have plans to go back to America in June as part of a business trip with my company. I might be able to stay there for 2-3 weeks after my coworkers return to Korea. *Maybe* a month, tops. **Is that long enough for me to go to an informed consent clinic and get my script?** If I get a prescription, I think I can take it to a trans-friendly Korean endo and continue the transition process here. If that doesn't work, **do you think I'd be able to get blood tests and send the results back to an American endo via email?** I'm really just looking to get the process started and having a way of continuing it safely from abroad.
* I have health insurance, but only technically. What I mean by that is, my insurance is reimbursement based, and the reimbursements go to my mom's bank account. So basically, if I use insurance, I'm just paying my mom for disowning me. Anyways, budgeting would be a lot easier if I had some **estimates as to how much it's going to cost (hormones, doctors visits, blood tests, etc) without any sort of insurance.**
* There's a solid chance that I will remain in Korea after graduation because of my girlfriend. **Are there any trans women here who have lived in Korea or have a similar experience?**
* Lastly, thanks for reading this if you got this far. You're awesome and it means a lot to me, even if you have no advice to give.

It's like, I suddenly realized that my vagina would be there even when I'm not paying attention to it and somehow that made me want one so much more than before.

I think i did the sports in highschool instead of acting because thats what he wanted.  Hes a great person, and fairly understanding, albeit definitely somewhat fearful of his own feminine side/denying of any homosexual tendencies he might have. 

But what if hes right?  I mean, my brother seems to relate better with women than me.  My ring and pointer fingers' ratio are quite masculine (sorta pseudo science sorta not).  I do get the autogynephilia, even tho i do think ray blanchard totally sucks.  My brother denies any transness, but hes the one that got dolled up by our female cousins. Was i jealous of the attention he got from women all the time? Im a fucking asshole to him--but arent all older brothers/siblings like that? 

Or maybe...and this is hopeful--maybe my brother learned all his femininity from me while ive been busy repressing and repressing all that in me

What is wrong with me? I dont really expect an answer i know its up to me to decide/figure it out, and yes im seeing a gender therapist.  

Im rated an infp on the personality thing, that makes me feel good but still, what if i just answered to how i wanted to be seen and wasnt honest enough with myself.

Or mayne all of this is me denying my transness out of fear. 

I just spiral in circles  im afraid to be and feel and socialize because i dont like what i see. I dont like...me.  And maybe what ive seen of myself is a damaged person trying hard to fit in...but im afraid that when i relax and be true to myself, ill be a man through and through, no matter what i try to do.

It was really great meeting you.
throw283,asktransgender,Can/Should I tell her this?,"Hi there. Throwaway to avoid the possibility of outing someone. I don't *think* it'll come up ... but still, just in case. 

I'm a cis, pansexual woman. Over the last little while, I've been flirting with a lovely trans woman. I met her a couple of times before her transition, but we didn't really happen to talk until later.

I don't know all the factors affecting this, and I assume there's a bunch of things she hasn't told me, but I do know she had a rough childhood and has had some bad past relationships. She seems to have self worth problems - sad, because of course she's a really beautiful person. And, she seems to have this idea that I (or anyone interested in her - doesn't seem to be just me) want something specific from her, that isn't her or a relationship with her. 

So, the other day we were texting, and she asked me if I saw her as a ""trans notch on my belt."" I was surprised - really surprised because we've been texting for a bit. I told her I was looking for something ongoing. I'm open to a variety of relationships, including everything from a casual, physical, relationship up to something emotionally invested and intense, but I'm not looking for a ""notch."" I told her that, and she asked me if I would still have been interested if she hadn't been trans. I said yes (with a lot of nervousness that it was the ""wrong"" answer), because it's true. She seemed happy and said she didn't want to be a fetish, which I can get. So I told her if she was worried about me only being interested in sex, that we could wait until whenever she feels comfortable. That I'm not in a rush or anything. She seemed to accept that, and we didn't really talk about it any more. 

Now ... I don't really remember what she looked like before her transition (partly purposefully forgetting and partly honestly having a bad memory) but I DO remember thinking of that person as attractive. I commented on it to someone else at the time. Thought that person was hot, and would have said something to that person, but didn't think they were interested. I would have been totally into being with that person then, in the meantime, and now. That person is attractive to me throughout. 

But can/should I tell her this? ""I was attracted to you before you transitioned"" seems sweet in theory if she's worried about me only wanting to be with her because of her transition. But what if that makes her think I still see her that way when I honestly don't? Or what if she doesn't want to be reminded of herself pre-transition? Or what if I'm misunderstanding and she just wanted some small reassurance and hasn't thought about it again since? I'm worried I'm overthinking this and should just let it go, but I'm also worried she's scared of me being a chaser or fetishist. She seems worried about my intentions, and isn't reassured by either compliments or shows of genuine interest.

Maybe this is the kind of thing that's just a matter of trust and time. But I wanted to ask you folks for some advice ... does this seem like something she might want to know? Or is this actually really awful with ""nice"" intent?

Thanks!!

Edit: upon reflection and with some advice, I think it's better if I leave it for her to mention again if she wants to. Thank you!! :)"

I've never really accepted that I'm trans until recently, I always tought or wanted to think that it was just a phase or the like, but it wasn't like that. I haven't told anyone but my therapist (about two weeks ago) and after I told her about I've been having this intense desire to become a woman, to transition, like there's an intense gender disphoria growing inside me. I've never  been super comfortable with my body, but I was able to live with that, it was ok, I could live as a regular boy with no problem whatsoever, but now there are these episodes in which I just can't stand it anymore, I want to cry, scream, and I just want to be seen and treated as a girl.

THROWAWAY-u_u,asktransgender,"The correct mindset for dealing with transphobia! From ""I just want to help"" to ""you deserve the Auschwitz treatment.""","Hiya!

I just got finished talking with someone who hates us. It was a pretty surreal experience... I'm in the closet (see my tag) so I don't have to deal with first-hand transphobia all to often.

Someone posted some of their artwork elsewhere on Reddit. More specifically, their guitar that she painted the trans flag onto. I (of course) scroll down to the bad comments section to see what's going on.

The lowest of the low on that thread is a (now removed) comment criticizing trans acceptance.

The exact comment was, 

&gt;Proud of being a mentally ill degenerate. It's disgusting that there are people who encourage this behavior instead of encouraging you to seek treatment for your mental disorder.

I think I actually had a good laugh from reading this. Sure, it's hateful, but it's really just such a facepalm-y thing to say.

Without further ado, my conversation with this person:

http://i.imgur.com/poT21Hy.png

I went in hoping for an easy win. Green isn't arguing ""God hates Fags"" or anything, he's appealing to facts.

One, *transgender-ness-ism* is a mental disorder, and two, Mentally ill people should seek treatment.

So, even though he's seems to be mistaken about what that treatment would be, he has his good intentions at heart, yeah? ""I want to help the ill get better."" What a noble guy.

After replying with a false equivalence fallacy, followed by an alternative fact about transitioning not working (it does), the thread gets locked and we're forced to continue the discussion in private messages.

I shorthand ""majority of scientific community "" with ""science"" and rather than arguing against the facts he goes for the smart-ass elementary schooler approach.

And of course... He snaps!

&gt;And you're a degenerate with a mental disorder. I would say you deserve to be thrown into the ovens but you probably will off yourself by the time you turn 30. I'm sorry that your parents failed you.

Now, I'm going to go ahead and share with y'all my more optimistic approach to being told I deserve to be executed for being transgender.

I think I would've been more discouraged if he didn't reveal himself to be just a regular ol' asshole. While it sucks that people like him exist in the world, it is better than the alternative.

He came in, masquerading as a guy who just wanted to help. He was patting himself on the back, trying to convince himself and the people listening to him that his only goal was to prevent medical malpractice and to save the poor transgenders who were being tricked into transitioning instead of taking their magical _Dysphoria-Away™ pills._

He didn't have the balls to admit from the start how he actually felt and he resorted to instead pretending to be a friend of the people.

I'm glad that he couldn't resist from telling me he'll be glad to see transgender people to kill themselves, because it kills the facade! He couldn't handle the pressure of arguing against facts and he had a break-down.

Again, it sucks that people like him exist in the world, but he discredits himself by lashing out. And that's all it really takes to combat his sort of hate. Show the world what he's really thinking and so they can finally stop agreeing with him."
lDuskrider,asktransgender,Picking up mail with an ID that doesn't match?,"So, I ordered something online under Bob Smith, because I'm sure not going to have automated online systems misgendering me if I can help it.

somnolencia,asktransgender,"The catch-22 of dysphoria and depression: Feel unable to work, but transitioning severely limits job opportunities","I've been stuck like this for years now, and I don't know what to do. I have good days and bad. I've postponed transition so long, I feel almost non-functional now.  

Four years ago I felt ready to start HRT. It helped that I had a great job and a blind confidence. I came out to my coworkers, and prepared to come out to my family. Then my parents died, and it totally derailed me. It happened at such a critical time. My job performance suffered, and I was fired. I took a few months off, and the months turned into years.  

I had a great career as a Web programmer, but that world moves fast, and going back has been very hard for me. I don't want to go back. I have a hard time caring about anything.  

It often seems like transition is the only way to snap out of this, but that seems risky since I'm broke, unemployed, and in debt. I avoid dealing with my external reality; I spend most of my time in bed. I feel overwhelmed and I try not to think about it. I'm transfeminine non-binary. What do I do?"
possibleocdfrantic,asktransgender,Can any of you help me with my frantic OCD thoughts?,"Hey, I'm a teenager, and I have a mix of both GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) and OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and over the past 2 years (only serious for the past year but was definitely there the year before though) I've had issues with gender identity.

It all started out in late 2014 or early 2015, I found out that I had a crossdressing fetish (I'm male at birth and homosexual and homoromantic), but it has since gone away and hopefully this won't offend anyone who has this sort of turn-on sexually but nowadays it grosses me out. But this basically caused what I'm dealing with now....

It's worth noting that during this timeperiod I did have a brief period where I was like ""Maybe I could be transgender, I want to see if I can try out ""being a woman"" for a week"" but that thought quickly passed and didn't really think much more of it.

Later on I decided to just quit that porn because even though it was kind of exciting, it was causing all sorts of anxiety and other stuff to occur so it just wasn't good for me.

Then we get to late 2015, and I decided that yes, I was transgender - just as a like ""I give in"" measure....But it didn't fit and I soon realized (Maybe a month later? I don't remember the exact time period it was over) that I didn't actually really feel female or whatever, and I wanted to be male, and I was fine for a few months, even entered a relationship (Although it only lasted a month and then I broke up with him....). After the relationship ended, that was when the whole ""transgender OCD"" thoughts started to get REALLY bad.

I was just dealing with thoughts every day and I wanted to identify as male but OCD was just so terrible at this point and everything was unbearable. I realized that I actually did have OCD not too long after this. But, I purely chose to live with it and tried to solve it on my own...and then we get to June 2016. I talked to a transgender person. There was nothing wrong with her so please don't get that impression if you were, she was nothing short of lovely and helping, but stuff kind of came across from me towards what I thought I thought about gender and at this point OCD was SO bad I decided to give in again and identify as female. This lasted maybe a month...? After this I actually had another unrelated kind of ""incident"" with OCD that caused me to actively HAVE to seek out a therapist because it was so bad. Stuff gets kind of spotty after this, I did go back to thinking I was male yet again, but that didn't last too too long.

So after this I decided that okay I am trans again, and this was kind of spotty and I went back and forth during a few short periods of time...But then I entered a relationship with a long term friend. Identifying as a woman. But, I still didn't really feel completely right in it but it was liveable at least. At this point I had people start calling me by ""she"" and other female pronouns.....but it felt really wrong. It kind of hurt almost. 

It is worth noting at this point I didn't really like being called male pronouns but that was more due to just me trying to identify as female because I had been dealing with OCD for so long. It's worth noting I was perfectly fine with male pronouns when I was younger. I mean, I did have a few isolated thoughts like ""I wish I was a woman"" when I was a kid, but that was due to me knowing I was attracted to men and not even really considering being gay, as I was taught by my assbackwards grandma that being gay just wasn't a real thing and people who were like that just chose to be like that, but I still didn't actually want to be a woman (At least to the best of memory) - I just didn't want to be with a woman. 

But I do remember a few cases that are interesting. I used to have a high voice when I was a kid and called up microsoft for activation and ended up talking to a microsoft agent due to me being kind of incompetent and not realizing what I was doing and she called me ""she"" and I really did not like that. At that point I couldn't wait till my voice lowered so people could refer to me as male.

Another occurence of this is when I was younger I played minecraft on servers (I know, that was a bad idea in hindsight, I actually still play minecraft but I only play singleplayer) and I used to have a skin that people thought was female (One of those weird teen skins) and I didn't like that, so I explicitly made my next skin to look male, with a beard and all.

But yeah, the relationship I was in lasted until late December of last year or early january this year when I broke it off. 

After this, I think I realized like all of the thoughts I had during the identifying as trans periods of not really feeling right had to mean something, and then since early January of this year I've been trying my damndest to fight OCD and be as male. One thing interesting to note is my emotions and other stuff are so much more genuine and stuff when I think I'm male, and I'm actually happier, at least I think I am....But my OCD is a lot worse and much more prevalent when I identify as male. 

I know I have a therapist and all, but I wanted to ask some actually transgender people what they thought and see what they thought about everything. I would x-post this or just post it to trans-ocd subreddit but that subreddit isn't very active.

Thanks for reading through this long post....

The laser and the electro have done nothing.  Nothing.  And when I shave, no matter how close the shave, how smooth my face, the permanent shadow WILL NOT GO AWAY.  There's just this grey stain under my skin that I just CAN NOT GET RID OF.  I've even gone through the pain of epilating my face.  Several times.

Hahaimtrulyinsanelol,asktransgender,Is it normal for dysphoria to almost completely disappear once starting hormones?,"Hey, I know I ask a lot of these dumb questions, but human nature has me a little confused. Almost like only praying when things are going bad.

I fought for a year for hormones, facing incredible dyphoria and depression. This led to me struggling with alcohol and I was never truly happy.

Last Friday i started taking hormones...and I feel completely different. Alcohol doesn't even have nearly as much of a hold over me, and in fact I resisted itquite easily last night. I haven't need my antidepressents since Friday, and even a day later I felt an immediate sense of calmness. Even my motivation and determination came back, like suddenly a veil was life and I was thinking 'crap, so much to do since I suddenly now can accomplish things in life.'

So when I see it written down haha I guess that about sums up why I need to continue.

But since Friday, I have almost no temptation to wear womens clothing (on my male body that is). I would certainly be happy to put nail polish on my toes, but I don't have this DYING desire to wear the clothes and put on the polish.

I've thought 'dang, if I felt like this as a guy without these hormones then I may have been fine...'

I have heard in the past I believe that this is a common place (for transwomen anyway, sorry) where they may struggle to continue because suddenly the dysphoria is gone.

Now the GD isnt 100% gone but this is the lowest amount Ive felt in...probably a year. Ive already come out to a good portion of my friends and family, and Im a little sad to see my strength go away, but I havent had a single temptation to stop taking my hormones.

Just a little confused is all! I feel so much better, am not nearly as emotional as I thought I would be my first week (probanly because the depression and alcohol additction produced enough emotion), and feel like 'huh, Im not super dysphoric now.'

Thanks for the help and hopefully reassurance! Im just a little afraid transitioning isnt the right choice, especially with a wife who thinks Im good looking as a guy, and is struggling mightily to see the changes begin. My therapiat and doctor both told me I need to worry about only myself right now, but I cant help it.

Thanks so much!  

EDIT: And I think after thinking about this a little, it's related a lot to fear. I am storing sperm this week, which will be $700, and I'm afraid of not passing, afraid that I'm too tall and would stand out, lots of facial hair, fear of wife leaving me, losing my job, etc...and I know I have a lot of additional adversity coming in the future. So that fear may be what is creating this doubt. And it's not even a true doubt. The medication is working and is making me feel good, so my fear mind is afraid that this better be the thing I need because the future is scary as hell. "
[deleted],asktransgender,Started hormones about a week ago...and my regret is growing? What's going on here?,"I took a year of fierce depression and confused self acceptance to finally reach hormones. I finally said ""alright, I'm not a guy, and I would be happier as a woman, and for my sake I need to move forward.""

The last 5 years I've struggled with drugs, alcohol, fierce depression and anxiety, and a feeling of hopelessness and as though nothing I did had meaning. I felt dead, and lacked motivation to do anything. I watched my peers succeed around me, and once aware of the gender dysphoria, experienced it so severely I would nearly lose my mind and my ability to focus on anything.  
So I finally did it. Told my wife, told my parents, many of my friends know, and I accepted that I'm trans. And I finally got hormones and the first day I took them I felt amazing. A calm swelled over me and the world felt brighter. I suddenly was motivated to do and accomplish things. My life felt like it had meaning, and I was able to stop taking my antidepressent with little trouble and even alcohol's pull on me instantly lessened.

But now, a week later, I feel depressed, lost, confused, and I feel regret.

I've already noticed my strength severely decrease. I'm the ""athletic, strong"" person in my circle of friends, and I had pride in that. But that's gone and it's made me a little sad. My wife has said she isn't attracted to women and doesn't want a wife, but she's moving along with me hoping it works out.  
Tomorrow I donate sperm, which is ungodly expensive and I feel like I'm losing a part of me there too. And I have to get facial hair removed, and start voice training..  
When I started the hormones my dysphoria went away for the most part. It came back here and there, but most of my mental illnesses, including GD disappeared.  
I feel like I would still be happier as a woman and I would press that button every time, but this is so much harder than I thought. The burning desire is gone for now, and I'm feeling a little hopeless, and a lot of fear.  
I know I suddenly stopped my SSRI and alcohol which will affect me, as will the hormones affect my mood I guess...  

But did I guess wrong? I feel the farthest from suicidal and extreme depression as ever, and I'll never forget my pain from before. But I feel this regretful pain, like I took my guy self too much for granted. I can't stop the hormones though, because I know I'll revert back to the mess I was.

I'm just so confused, and this is so hard..."

IreneHolmes222,asktransgender,Only take Estrogen and Not Anti Androgen? some help here please .... :),"First of all, I live in Asia, so things might be a little different here, but I dont think it makes too big of a difference.

So after about 3 months of evaluation from a psychiatrist, I visited an endocrinologist in the same hospital today... hoping for starting hrt with her...

She used to prescribe mtfs Anti androgen (we use Androcur mostly here) and Estrogen, but she said she doesnt really prescribe AA anymore, because it has too many side effects and stuff, unless its REALLY necessary and if E alone isnt enough to make changes. And for starters she suggests me to only take 2mg of estrogen pills (as Im writing this I realize i dont remember if its 2mg daily or every two days... some help here? normally it should be 2mg daily I think...).

So I wonder if only taking low dose of Estrogen is ok? Like I know things are gonna happen slower than taking both AA and E at the same time, but is the end result gonna be less good? Normally it takes 5 years for hormones to achieve full effects, so maybe because things will happen slower, my end result wont be as significant either?



By the way, just hearing she say the side effects of the pills really make me have second thoughts again... I knew most of them already, but just hearing it from a medical professional is on another level... All my dreams about boobs and curves just kinda got darker a bit... Not trying to be rude, and PLEASE correct me if Im wrong, I think I only see the positive cases mostly on here, maybe its just me being baised, but Im scared that maybe I really did ignore the potential danger and not took it seriously enough...

allie-the-cat,asktransgender,Dating Guys,"Ok, so I'm a trans woman. I blend well (basically never get misgendered, but some people say they can ""tell"", w/e that means). 

I've recently been curious about boys, so I got on tinder. I met a cute guy, first date went well, had the second one last night. 

I mentioned to him that I'm trans last night, and then things went badly. Basically, he's one of those cis white guys who sees himself as woke and progressive, but still has some problematic prejudices and can't take criticism. He maintained that even a girl who has had GCS still has an obligation to disclose her trans history, and that there's a fundamental difference in the womanhood of a trans girl and that of a cis girl. 

But like, how do I navigate dating? I don't really want to be upfront because I'd rather a guy get to know me first. But I also don't want to have to deal with stupid cis sexist people either. 

Guys and gals. What would you do?"
Thisdudeisonafence,asktransgender,"Does anyone else change their mind on transitioning, constantly?","I realized I was trans last year and since then every few months I'll feel come to a decision. Then I'll take steps to transition get cold feet and decide I'll just go back to being a man.

Right now my therapist is having me manage being male. 

Really the only thing keeping me from transitioning is the negative impact it would have on my career. 

I feel like I'm choosing between my career ambitions and being the girl I want to be.

MaidenoftheSeas,asktransgender,Genuine Joy,"I can't believe how awesome this is and great it feels. After being on HrT for so long I'm finally a near exact spitting image of a woman now. When I look in the mirror I always see a feminine girly face looking back at me. I love my overall slender body too. I was even called a ""lady"" today when I took my sister out to eat for her birthday! I was wearing loose fit female denim jeans, a tight long sleeve shirt, a cozy male Dickies jacket and was rocking my very short hair and was not even wearing any makeup either. I get gendered female like all the time now! I'm just so ecstatic right now.. my dreams are FINALLY happening! This feeling of actually being happy again is amazing because before tonight happened I basically forgot what happiness felt like literally. 

Now all I have left to do is get started on permanent facial hair removal while growing my hair long again. Things will be even better after those things too yessss!!

Being a woman for me so beats out being a man. "

phoenixlostarr,asktransgender,"Dad wants me to pretend to be a guy for grandmas funeral, what do I do?","So, I moved away from home for university (I'm in my 4th and final year now) and transitioned not long after. I've been on hormones almost 2 years by now, and I have friends, girlfriends, people who love and care about me.

I got a call from my dad last wednesday, saying that grandma (his mum) had died. A few days later, I called my mum to vent and grieve out loud, and she told m that dad had also been in contact, and had asked her to ask me to go as &lt;deadname&gt; and wear a suit, because he doesn't understand my being trans, at all. Mum told me that I probably should because I never got the chance to come out to grandma, but would understand completely no matter what I chose to do.

Two of my partners have offered to come with me, and both think I should wear a dress. I want to wear a dress, because if it's my last chance to say goodbye to her, I don't want to do it pretending to be someone I'm not, and use this to try and rebuild relationships with the rest of my family, but at the same time, I don't want to cause a scene or any drama.

I don't really know what to do."
stasisorchange,asktransgender,Romance post-transition for a 30-year old with no experience whatsoever? Is it even possible?,"I've admitted that I'm transgender (or at least that I despise being male and would rather take my chances and transition even though I don't know if I'm actually female mentally). I did have a second question, though, and I was wondering if anyone here would know the answer. I've heard that people who make it to 30 without any dating experience, relationship experience, or sexual experience have minimal and rapidly diminishing chances of ever finding love or having sex ... and that's for normal, otherwise-happy cisgendered people. I happen to be one of those socially awkward, physically clumsy, ugly, and totally sexually inexperienced people (so much so that I don't even know HOW to ask for a date with someone I find attractive), and my timeline for transition has me a bit worried, given that I'll turn 26 at about the same time I can start transition in earnest. See below:

* Summer 2017: Start HRT, schedule SRS
* Summer 2019: Get SRS (waitlists are literally worse than Satan)
* Summer 2020: Recovery complete. Ongoing HRT should have produced good results by now, given that I currently (pre-HRT) have super-low testosterone and feminine features (except for my shoulder width, which is fucking huge). By Fall 2020, I can finally begin living as a woman full-time.

By this point though, I'm 29 and a bit - with no dating experience, relationship experience, or sexual experience (since I'm not comfortable dating mid-transition. Life is difficult enough without having to explain THAT to prospective partners). I'm also a trans woman, with all the discrimination that entails. Do I realistically, honestly, believably, actually have anything more than a snowball's chance in hell of finding a nerdy bisexual/lesbian cis woman of about my age who'd be interested?

I ask because I've done some more deep thinking since my last (probably overly-brave) post, and transitioning in-and-of-itself won't be enough to save my life *if I spend that life alone*. From where I stand, the only thing that looks worse than suicide to me is struggling through four years of painful, difficult transition only to kill myself anyways because I'm just as lonely and depressed as before. If I'm going to go through with transition, I need to know that it'll fix all the life-threatening problems with my life, not just the one regarding self-image.

**PS**: Please please please be brutally honest with me. Don't just spout platitudes about how ""it gets better, trust me, everything will be fine"" if you aren't ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that it is true in my specific case. Not every story gets a happy ending, and if mine doesn't look like the type that will, **don't lie to me and make me suffer for four more years** *just on the outside chance that the stars will align and the impossible actually happens*. I'm going to trust that you'll all be objective with me, and not deceive me so that you can pat yourself on the back and be glad that you ""saved"" the life of a stranger on the internet. 

Please don't betray that trust. Please?"
MonicaRising,asktransgender,Food preferences changing on HRT,"So we all know about spiro leading to an affinity for pickles. Totally true. But what else has changed for you food-preference wise? Especially snack foods? For me it's the saltier stuff. Always liked it I suppose. Now I love it. Like chips (American chips - but crisps if you are of the British persuasion). But weirdly, I don't go gaga for chocolate like I always have. I prefer vanilla or blackberry icecream now, which seems like sacrilege, I know ☺! I don't need to have a chocolate snack at the ready. Can totally pass on a Hershey kiss or reese's peanut butter cup. I'm like - nah. In no particular order - Loving oranges, stir fry, snacking on crackers with spicy cheese or pepperoni (and pickles of course). Loaded baked potato (never liked baked potatoes much), sweet potatoes / yams w/ brown sugar and butter (never ate those either. but checked w/my Endo - it's all good cuz my Potassium levels are chill)...  I stopped eating sweet breakfast cereals, waffles, cookies... and also I am just not as hungry in general. None of it happened over night. Not gaining or losing any weight outside of the usual 1 or 2 lb fluctuation here or there. I just noticed that about 4 months on HRT and recently doubling spiro, that yeah... my tastes have definitely changed a little bit. How about you?"

PMme_Your_Problem,asktransgender,I'm seriously considering coming out to my friends,"To say it in the least amount of words: I'm 16 yo, gonna turn 17 in July. I'm transgender, and I have felt this way for a long time. I've only got a few solid friends while I'm friendly and on good terms with the rest. I've only come out to one of my solid friends. He's taken it well. But here is where the problems begin.

My parents found out when they went through my  phone and its messages with said friend, two days before Christmas. They're not really happy. They constantly insist that no one can respect me for this, and that someone will use this against me. Basically saying that everyone is out to get me. When it comes to arguments they keep vetoing my side of it, switching between ""You need to check all your facts"" and ""You're still young and shouldn't have opinions"", each when it suits them. 

And this is the complication. I live in a boarding school. I stay here from Monday till Saturday every week, and I get an increasingly uncomfortable visit home for the weekend. When I go home it generally becomes really tense and threatens to turn into a shit show every time. I'm starting to treat school as a relief, even although it encourages us to take very  masculine roles and responsibilities. To keep a summary of my year's members, we all try band together when we can, everyone can talk easily to one another, despite the social standing and group. We are a band of 'brothers'. These guys are the ones who have picked me up when I've had my intense troubles, especially last year. I've always been considered the weird one, and slowly I've risen to shape it into something different. They all know me intimately as the smart, bit strange guy with some emotional issues. We know every other person pretty well like that. 

So, I want to come out. I constantly feel that I'm with holding something whenever it I get asked about why I struggle with girls, or how come I haven't had my first kiss. And I feel like I just want to scream out the reason, but I still have the strange anxiety for rejection. So I guess this is me asking for advise, for help, and for guidance."

I have great friends and family who all accept me, but I'm still struggling. I don't know why and I feel like I should be further along by now

Goodtimes490,asktransgender,BiPolar and Transgender,"Hello all.  New to Reddit; longtime lurker.

I'm MTF transgender.  In the closet to all but my wife, therapists and medical providers.  I'm also bi-polar type 2.  I was eaten alive by depression connected in part with being transgender and in the closet.  Finally solved the depression part through good medical care.  It helped me not feel so hopeless about not transitioning.

That said I still have hypomanic periods.  During them my feelings about possible transition elevate and I become obsessed.  Because I've decided to remain in the closet for various reasons, primarily family and professional, this can be destructive.  I hide my cross dressing and it creates problems, the deceptive hiding.

Can anyone relate? Any similar experiences?  Advice for dealing with it in a more healthy manner?"

danksforthememeriess,asktransgender,Does it sound to you like I'm genderfluid?,"So recently I've begun exploring my gender identity because, although I am AFAB, I've never felt comfortable being called a ""lady"" and kinda squirm at ""girl"" too. I'm pretty dense and didn't realize I was attracted to women until I was 14 (subsequently, I didn't realize I was not sexually attracted to men until almost a year ago). After a lot of reflection, I realize that I'm a fairly androgynous and slightly masculine-leaning person. I have experienced the dysphoria that many FtM people describe and have done unsafe and unhealthy things to try to alleviate it (wouldn't get out of bed or shower because I couldn't stand to see my breasts, physically holding my breasts down with my hands in front of the mirror to try to achieve a flatter chest, binding unsafely, feeling anxious in women's clothing). But I don't always feel this dysphoria - in fact, for the past two days, I've felt like a woman. I seem to switch between feeling like a woman and a man, sometimes in between. Could I be genderfluid?"
NASM8bit,asktransgender,"Someone tell me about yourself. Tell me when you figured it out. Tell me about what life is like, how it could be better. Obligatory question Mark?","*Why?*

Cause I'm a 26 year old heterosexual white American male. I don't know any trans people. I'm afraid I just don't understand it. I know I can and that would be better for everyone if I could figure it out.

I had a gay friend growing up, and I'm glad I did. When we were little kids he didn't identify as gay, but as middle school and high school came along and we started talking about girls, he just seemed kind of different from our group as you can imagine a gay teen would in that situation. He came out the summer before we went to college, and since then I've been a very strong advocate of gay rights (I wasnt anti gay before but just didnt get involved really at all). I would talk to him and ask questions to understand him better, but I also kind of understood cause I had known the guy since tee ball in kindergarten.

**Fast forward to today-** I'm a libertarian guy that knows that by identifying with a gender different then the one on your birth certificate doesn't affect me in any way, but I have a harder time understanding why. I'm socially liberal, and am against the rollbacks on the bathroom policies, but that's more because I feel like I should be, not because I understand why I should be.

---

What I'm asking: Tell me the stuff in the topic title. Tell me something that will help me understand what it is like for someone to be trans. I didn't grow up with a trans friend like I did a gay friend so I don't understand it as well. Just tell me about you if you are trans. I'll keep voting for and supporting you to the extent I can as an American, but I'd like to understand more.

*Disclaimer:* I literally know nothing about being transgender. I'm very sorry if I said something that offended you, and please let me know if I did. "
trans-lexi,asktransgender,I don't know how to do this.,"For context: I'm a 20 year old trans girl. I'm almost done with my second month of hormones. (although, it's kind of like my first month, but a second time, considering there were almost 3 months in between the end of my first month and the beginning of my second.) I work as a software developer for a university's IT Department. 

I'm not out at work. And it's only been within the last few months that I've asked my closest, longest known friends to start referring to me as she/her. 

I had a few people in the last couple years who knew and would refer to me as she/her and my preferred name, but it took me so long to stop being afraid of telling the people who had known me the longest.  

I don't know what I'm doing though. I live in a southern state. I support myself with my job. But I'm terrified of the repercussions of coming out at work. 

And if I get fired, I'm scared I don't know how easy/hard it'll be to find a new job. 

I just know I can't hide things forever. Eventually my chest is going to start growing as my breasts start budding and stuff and there'll come a point where I'll have to come out at work.

honaka_namnah,asktransgender,Question about prolactin levels and patches/pills,"I'm a little worried about my hormone levels ...

Okay so I'm on HRT for ~3 months and started on Androcur 50 and Progynova 2mg. After 1.5 months in January my E was at 56 ng/L and prolactin at 21µg/L. I had switched endos and because my E was pretty low he switched me to Dermestril 100 patches which should be stronger (he aims at 100~200). He prefers to use gel or patches over pills.

Now (again 1.5 months) later my E is at 41ng/L but prolactin is at 36µg/L! So E dropped and prolactin shot way up ... Blood was taken about a day after I applied a fresh patch.

I've read that high prolactin can be caused by a wide variety of reasons but if the patches are possibly the problem then I'm going to ask to be switched back to pills. So I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with switching to another form of E?"

So for a few days now I've been feeling like maybe transitioning isn't for me.
I wake up and look in the mirror and I like what I see, but it's not necessarily a woman, more like a very feminine guy.

I feel like I could live happily as a gay guy now, HRT hasn't done much to me in terms of physical appearances but my libido has dropped dead and I feel much better about myself.

It's so strange, I've always wanted to be a woman, now when I actually have the chance and even started transitioning I feel like I could be happy as a man? Am I just in denial or did I read too much yaoi lately or something? &gt;_&gt;

gayluiigi,asktransgender,Gay media before realizing you're trans,"I'm curious about something: before I identified as trans, I was REALLY into media involving gay/bi men and gay male culture. I would actively seek out anything that involved a romance between two men or media that was made by gay/bi men. I loved watching men kiss each other and was way more into gay romance than straight romance.

I didn't realize I was trans yet but the internet told me there were straight women who were really into m/m relationships (including ""yaoi fangirls"") so I assumed I was one of them, even though it didn't really seem quite right. Even though I enjoyed gay male stories it didn't lead to me discovering I was a gay trans man since so many straight cis women seemed to be into it too. For a while my fixation with media about gay/bi men made me feel invalidated in a way?? Like I sort of felt like I didn't deserve to call myself a gay man and that maybe I was just some straight woman with self-loathing issues who was weirdly obsessed with gay men, since so many straight cis women were into the same gay stuff I was into. 

Anyways, I'm really curious about how other trans people (of all sexualities) related to gay/bi/lesbian media before they discovered they were trans. Did any of you feel a similar connection to gay stuff?"

anotherfingthroway,asktransgender,Cypro interfering with estrogen?,"Helo, 22 mtf trans here.
For 6 months of my transition I was taking 4mg estradiol valerate (oral, generic) along with 200mg spironolactone (oral, generic). My estrogen level was quite high (max 78 pg/ml i think) but my T level was also too high (around 200-something ng/dl). I decided under counsel of my endocrinologist to start ordering the drug Procur (cyproterone acetate, oral) from the internet and taking that instead.
Currently I take 25 mg cypro every day. The results, as far as testosterone is concerned, have been good. my current T level is 11 ng/dl. However, it has significantly reduced my estrogen level even though I was taking the same dose. My estrogen level dropped to 28 pg/ml unexpectedly. Unsure of what to do and unable to see my endo yet, I started taking 6mg of oral estradiol everyday. My estrogen level reached about 46pg/ml.

mjollnir82,asktransgender,"Pre-everything, who did crossdress and experience more assertively and confidence?","This may be a dumb question, but I would like to talk about it. I feel a woman, AMAB, never crossdressed in my life, and starting to do it today (I think I don't have a really strong preference for ""femme"" aspect and dressing). 
Yesterday, I put some nail polish. I din't feel feminine, but... it helped me to be more focused on myself and put away this voices and pressures in my head that were on for many years in my life.
It is like the nail polish helped me ""seeing"" myself, as belonging to the female gender. Just this.
How incredible is that?

I lived for many years in a kind of ""reactive"" way: I knew I had to do things, and I was failing at the most of those. It is not just about the fact that I was a ""male"", but the fact that, to me, ""the others were right"", and I was behaving not properly, I was not able to be good at study, I didn't want to work, I didn't want to do things.
Now, after discovering transgender people, and started feeling that I am a girl, I started a battle with my ""internal pressures and voices, and judgements"", trying everyday to say that they are wrong.
Now, the nail polish seems to give me a lot of strength, also if I am alone at home. And takes me on a level on which I don't have the sensation that I have to convince others that I am not what they say.

I believe that I have/had some issues with caring too much about others, fear of abandonment, and dependency. I am analysing all this in therapy. I think that therapy is important to address such issues, along understanding yourself.

Well, I would like to know who else experienced this.
Also, I am curious about non-binary, in particular: as a non-binary, what is the most difficult thing that you had to face for affirming your identity? 

Thanks anyone for the discussion :)"

However, after my friend and I left the show, she said it had left a bad taste in her mouth because ""sure they included a trans person, but she was very much passing so it almost didn't count"".

I'm sorry but what? Do her experiences as a trans woman not matter because she passes? Is she somehow less affected by rape culture because she passes? Do you really think that she ""almost doesn't count"" as a trans person because she passes?

ILikeSchecters,asktransgender,Transition is too slow [rant][Im sorry],"Transition is too slow. 87 days = 12.42857 weeks = 2.8064516 months (yay Java programs). I feel like so little has changed. Ya I have less body hair, and I have breast buds and my skin is a bit softer. But holy fuck the hate I have for my body and my role in society is real. I hate how goddamn thick my neck and shoulders are. All of the muscle I have really makes me super pissed off. I hate my beard. I hate my thick ass guitar fingers. Im pretty sure I pass enough to blend in while in public - I don’t notice any weird stares when Im out. I think my voice can pass pretty well at this point; however, the constant stressing out over whether transitions going to be enough is killing my life at this point. I can’t wait any longer - I try so hard to take my mind off of these issues, but nothing seems to work. It is always sitting in the back of my mind when Im deep in thought doing my engineering homework even. I look back in time and see some progress in terms of my body and my life, sure. But its just not enough. All of this seems like some stupid idea that was too ridiculous in the first place. Unattainable. I sure as fuck would have blown my brains out given enough time if I didn’t try to transition. At least doing what I am now gives me some hope that things might be better. But Im so numb. I live day to day hoping that I have this moment where I realize things are okay. 

Somedays I blow up - my room mates try to be as supportive as they know how, but they don’t understand any of it. Two of my room mates are my brothers, and one of them really bothers me because he hasn’t done any research himself. I know some might think I should sit him down and tell him the way things are, but its depressing as fucking talking about yourself like you’re presenting a fucking dissertation. I just want some semblance of comfort. I don’t get that anywhere: in my own head, my own house, my profession, my country - everywhere seems hellbent on subjecting some idea of what I should be. Im sick of fighting so many battles in life, and getting returns that are just too god damn small to make a discernible difference. Some days are really hard. I one night even wrote a backup suicide note in case I ever decided it was too much (probably the lowest night of my life. Im not proud of it at all). Too many people care about me to do something like that, even though Im in so much pain every minute of everyday. Im at a point where things need to get better, but as to how I fix it is a mystery.

The loneliness really gets to me. I have people who care about me in my life, but know one really understands what Im going through. I don’t know any other trans people, and I am too shy to go and just meet people on a whim. I feel like Im a burden on everyone in my life. Many times I wonder why anyone even wants anything to do with me. I wish I could do better for everyone I love, but I don’t feel strong enough. I wish I could see the changes that the success stories on reddit show - instead I see how far I have left to go and I just get sad, anxious that I cant go and work on it like I would a coding assignment where I have control and can just crank it out. I wish I could look back on my former self and see that [deadname] and Rachel are two completely different people. But I look in the mirror every morning, looking for something different, only to see the same old fucking face with a little bit more stubble than the night before. The same muscles. The same flat chest. It just feels like nothing changes and Ill be forever unhappy. I know three months on HRT isnt a ton, but I was hoping to at least see some hope by now. I dont want to be unhappy anymore. Im scared for myself and my future, and so much seems unfixable."
FragrantKnife,asktransgender,"Help dealing with ""desistance"" argument about trans kids?","Hi all. A friend of mine sent me an article recently asking for my thoughts on it (Warning, sorta transphobic stuff towards trans kids):

http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-soh-trans-feminism-anti-science-20170210-story.html

The title is pretty click-baity, I know. Anyway, the article goes on to argue that trans kids should be dealt with differently than they are because of ""desistance,"" the idea that most gender-dysphoric kids lose their dysphoria as they age.

After a little digging, I'm not sure how much actual science confirms or denies this idea. I've found a [huffpo article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690.html) arguing against desistance, but generally I try to find more centrist sources for arguing against stuff like this.

TrnsdrmlCelebration,asktransgender,Where should I even start?,"Oh lord... here we go. I'm 27 years old, mtf and so deep in the closet I have no idea where to start.

First things first, I'm in recovery. I think this is important because I haven't really been able to be honest with myself until getting sober. Now that the insanity has subsided, it's a lot harder to hide from myself. Also I'm no psychologist but I think part of the reason why I drank and did all that other stuff was to repress the feeling of being out of place in my own body. It's so completely insane for me to be typing all this yet it needs to come out. Also I feel sort of like a fake because I'm so old now. But I spent a decade+ in active addiction so I feel like I'm just picking up where I left off when I was thirteen.

I have no idea where to start, who to talk to etc. Fortunately (?) I've been considering seeing a therapist recently for unrelated (yet sooo related) depression type stuff. I'm on medication for depression but I'm still a nervous wreck. That comes with the territory of being in recovery from alcoholism, but I've heard nothing but good things about therapy. 

I just feel like I can no longer hide from this. I feel like I'd make an ugly girl because I can't imagine not being in this body (which does and always has seemed hypermasculine) but today, writing this, it doesn't seem to matter so much.

So where do I start? Therapist? Friends? I have told my sponsor about this but indicated that it was more of a childhood thing I outgrew. He understood but it hasn't been revisited. The thought of telling my family and coworkers is terrifying.

Thanks for any help you can give me and I hope I'm posting this in the right subreddit ��"
needhelpplex,asktransgender,How to deal with depression?,"When I'm not working I can't get out of bed, usually till midday. I usually can't bring myself to do simple errands. I nicked myself shaving this morning, and used that as an excuse to not go to my laser hair removal appointment (or even call to cancel). I struggle to bring myself to practice makeup or voice, for legitimate reasons but also because I'm just so unmotivated. Some days I feel intense sadness/crying, but most days it's just a lack of motivation to do anything. I was depressed three years ago and overcame that, and I feel like the last few months I've been trying to convince myself I'm not depressed again... because I don't want to have to deal with the recovery. I remember how painful it was to claw my way out of it last time, and this time I just have so much more on my plate with transitioning. The worst part is knowing that I probably need help, and being too scared, or unmotivated, to ask for it. I smoke marijuana daily, usually at night, which helps with treating the depression and making me feel ""okay"", but I know it doesn't help fix the real issues. I don't even know what the real issues are (who does when they're depressed?), I'm just unhappy and unmotivated.

I'm working more to compensate for how expensive transitioning will be, and in some ways working helps to distract me from feeling so bad, but I also feel like I have no downtime. The days off that I do have, I still have important things to do, but get overwhelmed with the feelings I try to ignore by working. I know exercising would help. I know therapy would help. I know I have obligations to work, apply to university, stay social with friends, go to laser/electrolysis appointments, practice makeup/voice when I have opportunities, etc. I just can't do anything.

eyelashesthatcut,asktransgender,2nd guessing HRT: Can I get some advice?,"I need some encouragement and kind words today. Posting on an alt account so I can just spill it.

*TL,DR: One month on HRT and I'm questioning everything more than before.*

So I started HRT at the beginning of the year.  I'm not in the best spot financially at the moment due to changing jobs and losing my insurance.  I've been paying for my prescriptions, appointments and labs all out of pocket.  Funny enough, the cost adds up to about what my premium would be if I had insurance, but I would still have to pay copays, etc.

It's been a month now.  When I first started, I was elated and nervous, but I felt relieved that I had finally taken the first steps.  My main goal in transitioning and hormone replacement is psychological.  I have been prescribed so many different antidepressants and anti anxiety meds throughout my life.  I would typically experience a little change in mood for a couple weeks, then I wouldn't notice anything different from that point on.  In fact, I notice my mood is affected by diet and exercise way more than by meds or therapy.  So, last year I went off everything.  It was rough for a month, but I finally started feeling clear-headed and the question I was still left with was my gender.  I did my research and asked around here and Susan's, and found that many trans people noted a shift in their mental health after starting HRT.  I decided it was worth it.

It's now been a month, and aside from a couple minor changes (breasts/nipple growth, some overwhelming emotions), I haven't really felt any different.  At this time I started playing around with ""dressing the part"" by wearing makeup and girl clothes more frequently.  I realized that I felt very comfortable in tank tops and leggings while just chilling around the house, but I had to really ""femme it up"" in order to ease my anxiety while in public.  I was blessed with a rather effeminate shape, and I did receive a lot of positive feedback while presenting as a girl in public.

Okay okay, I know this is all bullshit.  I know that I don't have to fit anyone else's idea of gender in order to be me.  I've been genderfluid my whole life, and I'm cool with that.  I also acknowledge that I was letting others (mainly cis ""het"" guys) influence me to shoehorn myself into that box.  Luckily, I realized pretty quick that I didn't need to do this, and I had to examine what I really wanted to get out of HRT.

Okay! So now we're all caught up.  Currently, I'm down to my last few days of E (1mg bid) and Spiro (50mg bid), and I've only been taking these low doses for about a month.  I was also prescribed Finasteride, but it was too expensive at the time.  I'm still not in the best shape financially, but my friend told me that girls with less money than I have managed to afford it.

What I'd like to ask is this:  Is it too early to tell for sure?  Am I second guessing because I'm worried about money, or because I'm not noticing changes fast enough?  Have any of you taken hormones specifically for the mental health changes associated with it and what were your experiences?

Thanks a lot for reading!"

On the other side I don't hate my genitals. I kinda feel indifferent about them. I sure never liked to look at it while mastubarting, but no strong negative feelings. Is this genital dysphoria ?

I feel like this might just be an insecurity thing, not even trans-related.

Max_Headroom_,asktransgender,"I wish I had a vagina, yet i am comfortable with my masculinity?","To make it perfectly clear, I have NO PROBLEM with my masculinity. I take no issue with my stubble or body hair. I take no issue with my masculine personality. I take no issue with being called a ""man"". However, what i do take issue with is what many would say is a man's most masculine feature, my penis.

To put it bluntly, it disgusts me. Not in the sense that it's gross, but in the sense that it feels ""forced"" if that makes much sense, like it doesn't belong there. I think the best way to describe it is if you woke up one day and had a 6 finger, it feels very surreal, odd, and wrong. I feel that i would be much more comfortable with my genitalia if i had a vagina.

I don't desire any other female body parts, like ovaries or breasts, nor do i feel like if i had said vagina that i would identify as anything other then male. So i don't exactly understand why i feel this way, and that is what i am hoping you guys can answer.

I apologise if i am being vague, but i have never really talked about this, and the dissatisfaction i feel for my penis is hard to describe, so if you need me to give more detail, i can."
HyacinthGirI,asktransgender,Detransitioning for love?,"I'm MtF, 21 years old. I've been transitioning something like two years now, and am passing and living as a woman in daily life. 

I'm in a relationship with a girl, something I didn't predict happening, and something she never expected either. She suffers pretty massively from anxiety and depression, and is terrified at the thought of coming out. Its something we're working towards, but I've been thinking for some time now that if its something she can never come around to doing, or something that would potentially break us up before she was ready, I'd rather transition back to being a man than to lose her.

Its something I think I might discuss with a very close friend and potentially counsellors, but I'm sure in a way that I'd rather try that than to lose her. I don't think it would be overly much of a loss for me- certainly if I stayed on hormones, I think it could work out for me. Socially, it would feel weird to be male, but I could learn the role and it might even be fun in a way. I do like doing my nails, makeup, and hair, but I don't even do them very often and wouldn't necessarily be precluded from doing them anyway. I don't know if I'd cut my hair or not, I can't figure out exactly how I'd dress, or what name I would go by, but there's no part of me that's absolutely panicked or disgusted by the thought of being a man. I would definitely feel a bit sad at being excluded from being ""one of the girls,"" but I can't make out why that is.

I don't know, this isn't something I'm considering immediately acting on, nor is it something I hope to do, but its a thought that for better or worse is in my head, and maybe this place can help me sort out my thoughts. "
Kristinedk86,asktransgender,A bit too early for changes ?,"Hello everybody,

I recently started HRT, cypro and progynova, and i seam to be experiencing changes already, all though these changes are very welcome, it just seams strange it's happening so fast.

* My underarms are softer and dryer
* Nipples have increased in size a little bit, increased sensitivity, i believe coloring has changed a slight bit, not sure.
* Puffy nipples, i seam to also sense something medium hard below
* Gynecomastia, possible that methotrexate assisted with that prior to HRT, i've stopped taking MTX, it does feel bouncy however and a small hand full.
* when i lie on my chest or lean, it gets a bit sore, nothing much
* Huge appetite, i've been eating a lot more at a time and more often. (been wanting to put on weight for ages but never been able to eat much)
* My low's are a lot higher than before (mood) and my high's are me singing to music with a huge smile on my face.
* Libido (in my mind) has sky rocketed, which has increased masturbation, its starting to reduce now however.
* random erections has reduced a lot, it's random whether i get erection in the morning.
* ejaculation seams harder and harder to achieve, requires more stimuli, both mentally and physically.
* My wife says that some area's of my skin seam lighter.
* Acne has slowed down a lot, i useually concider my self a pizza face and back, but the amount seams to be going down and i think it will be gone soon.

It's a lot of changes, which are all very welcome, i feel more aligned with my self, i was however expecting the first changes after a month (from other people's reports). Is this normal or have i just been lucky ?

Advice/feedback,"So this is complex to me and this is really the only place I could think to get answers or advice on what I'm feeling and if it's considered ""acceptable"" or not. Please excuse any verbiage I use that may be considered inappropriate, I'm not trying to offend I just don't know. 


 I was born a male, and I'm actually quite happy with my body and my sexuality (straight). About 14  years ago when I was in my late teens, I started using a different username online. I was practically raised on the Internet,  my family kept me very sheltered and I learned almost everything outside of school online. My Internet identity was my closest real identity.  My new username was misspoke in real world by friends in a way that made it sound like ""Kitty"" , so much so that when my friends joined an online role play server requiring a first and last name, I went ahead and made the first name ""Kitty"" and the last name my normal username. This game also had it setup so that male characters started with a higher ""Strength"" attribute and females a higher ""Agility"" attribute,  so I made a female characters. Over the course of the next two years I was frequently mistaken for an actual female in real world, and eventually got tired of correcting people and just ignored it.


After I left that community I retained the full name and played other online games without real world friends. I made many friends, most of which assumed I was a female but I never really corrected anyone. It felt nice getting the attention and such. I never let things get sexual, and when things started to get weird I would just tell people I was already seeing someone and that worked most of the time. Then of course the rest would be pushy and demanding and I would never speak to them again! It was a different feeling but I felt comfortable in this way people perceived me, it was like it felt natural and being referred to as ""ma'am"" or ""she"" gives me a feeling of fulfillment like it's where I belong. If that makes sense. 


This has been going on for over a decade. I had even created a whole identity of who I ""am"" with my new ""Real name"" and a decade of Internet history. I had such a digital footprint of my feminine persona that I actually have had two instances so far where a business called request to speak to my fake feminine persona. I've gone so far that I did my own voice training and I've nearly perfected my feminine voice. 


I know I'm dragging on and this must be really weird and maybe it doesn't belong here, but I love my feminine persona but I also love my masculine real world. I'm now happily married and she knows about my feminine persona and accepts it as part of my personal identity and I am forever grateful for that. I really don't know what it is that binds me to my feminine side, it's not a sexual desire I just love being appreciated for my femininity I guess? I honestly have friends online I've know for 6+ years and they believe I am a female in real world. 



Is this an okay thing? I've always wanted to help in the transgender community, especially with voice training as I have found many tricks to help and was able to help a coworker once with her voice (mtf) and that was one of the greatest feelings helping someone with that, but I've always been worried that someone would ask how I learned it myself and that I would be looked down upon if I told them why.

late_bloomer26,asktransgender,Why am I doing this? [possible trigger warning],"I have been meaning to post this for a while. Not really a question, but it writing it helped me a lot. I hope can help others too.

Answer: because I have to. I never chose to have these feelings; I tried repressing them, but it was killing me. I hated myself. As much as I had accomplished, as fortunate as I had been, I felt empty. I was lying to myself and to the people I loved. I just I couldn't do it anymore. I'm not brave. I'm a survivor.

I have finally come to terms with being transgender. Honestly, it's fucking terrifying. I started transitioning at 35. I remain hopeful, but I may never ""pass"". I face discrimination, harassment, and worse. This not only affects me it also affects those around me. I'll have to be on medication for the rest of my life, and I will need surgery - most likely a few in order to get my body a bit closer to the woman I identify as.

But it is soooo worth it! I feel right for the first time. The enormous weight of my dark secret has been lifted. I finally get to be a woman! And you know what? I'm proud to be trans. Yeah, it would have been great to be born as the gender that matches my neurology, but that didn't happen. My perspective will be forever unique, and I get to be a part of an amazing community. Oh, and did I mention: I GET TO BE A WOMAN!!!

I love you guys. Thank you for being an important part of what got me to where I am. If your are here you have take a step in the right direction. Whether or not transitioning is right for you, being true to yourself is always a good decision.

kitkatrad,asktransgender,Jealousy over not experiencing male fail yet,"Edit: To correct a missing piece of information

Hi everyone! My name is Kathryn and also go by KitKat or just Kat. As my flair states I've only been on HRT since 30 November 2016 so it has not quite been 3 months yet and on the 1st of March will have my 3 month checkup with my Endo. Really really really hoping that I get my scripts bumped up a bit and yes I know higher dosage does not mean that it'll work better or faster I just think that it is not enough. Though I have gotta say breast growth has been surprisingly fast not sure what size cup as the bras I wear are the cheapie $5 ones from walmart (don't want to spend good money until they settle on a size for more than a week or so) but I can't hide them wearing a loose fitting t-shirt.

Anyways let me get to the reason I'm posting :) Sorry I tend to just go off topic on a tangent without realising it. I keep reading about how all of these girls here are male failing and such and I am just super jealous but I shouldn't be and feel pretty guilty about it. If I put in the effort, as in shave, light face of makeup, and a cute outfit I can go the entire day without being misgendered once even with my obviously male voice and I don't live in a very accepting place. It isn't horrible either just isn't great though I can honestly say I haven't felt threatened before by anyone though I know many people who have. I am overweight, however I carry it pretty well, fairly feminine face, hands aren't too big, size 9.5 - 10 shoes in womens and yes I can't help but feel jealous of the fact that when I go out in ""boy mode"" (really hate that term but not sure of another one) everyone see's me as a guy. 

Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this while I wait for the hormones to work their magic?

TL;DR Getting super jealous of people male failing and I know it's ridiculous because I've only been on HRT for 3 months. Looking for advice to deal with it while I wait."
niku_j97,asktransgender,It's all in our head!! (Trigger warning),"There is a general theory that if we gain control of our minds we can do anything.
 
My mother is dead stuck on the fact that i can change my thinking to be in alignment with gender norms. That i could take steps towards not thinking in that direction and pray.  I'm not at all comfortable as presenting as male but since i'm not that feminine and i'm a bit fat nobody knows a thing. Tbh i know i can live as male, but i don't think i'll be happy and if i'm not happy i won't be able to achieve as much as i would if i'm happy.

Happy : I smile and laugh a lot when i'm around people but i cry a lot when i'm alone. The way i see it, dysphoria is occupying a lot of space and i believe that i'll be able to study more or work more if this problem is solved. 

Now do you believe being transgender is all in our heads and we can change that with out mind powers (sounds really absurd to me) . Most cis people will say we over-react to gender non-conformity and we should be happy with what is given to us. And most trans people would say it's all bs.

Now which of this is really true? I could have asked this my psychiatrist but she would think i'm uncertain and would deny me hormones. Damn Gatekeeping,

Why is it okay to ignore their intolerance? To me it doesn't make sense.

Is it wrong to feel unsafe at the idea of having people with those views brought into my country? I mean, they execute people simply for being LGBT in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, etc. Which tend to be predominantly Muslim.

Well, thanks school counsellor, because not only did you kinda out me to my parents AND make the teachers stop calling me Claire ""due to legal reasons,"" you also told my parents that I am a ""distraction"" by wearing fucking light makeup and sometimes feminine clothing. Now they don't want me to wear my bra to school (but that won't stop me haha i want to die) or basically anything that might make me into ""a distraction.""

She says that I'm being more social with them and seem happier, but bitch I'm not. I feel fucking empty inside. Not just hopeless, but actually empty. It's hard to think about *anything* sometimes. Not only that, but I think my antidepressant (40mg Prozac if you're curious) is also replacing my depression with pure self-hatred.

AlikiVougiouklaki,asktransgender,"I only sometimes gender myself correctly in my head, and it makes me nervous","I'm MtF and still present male, so it's usually hard to feel female. 

In my head, I usually gender myself 50/50. Whenever I intuitively think ""she"" or ""Sonia,"" I feel quite happy and validated. I feel like I'm trans and female and will be on my way to transition.

But it doesn't always come so naturally. Other times I'll actively, consciously gender myself female, to reproduce that happy feeling, but it won't...stick. It'll feel contrived, like ""she"" and ""Sonia"" aren't really mine. It's as if my intuition is able to make the leap sometimes, which makes me feel great—but my intellect won't buy it.

Those times make me afraid I'm not trans; or that being a woman will feel just as strange as being a man feels now; or that I'll never feel like a woman. Can anyone relate?"
zoeintheafternoon,asktransgender,"[Platitude Warning] This is a marathon, not a sprint.","Today, after complaining idly about not wanting to put on pants before I went out to do errands, my roommate pushed one of her dresses on me pretty hard, which I would normally interpret as lovingly affirming. As I haven't waxed or shaved in a minute (it's winter), I demurred. She insisted, the dress being floor length, and my boots calf-high, but I still refused. Then I felt odd, as though I was being inauthentically trans by not wanting to wear the dress. (FTR I do like dresses, but haven't worn one out into a space that wasn't explicitly queer-friendly yet)

Then I realized that, over the last three months, I've changed so, so much, but I've done it one step at a time. It's how I've been able to go to work, to help take care of kids; to do things other than just fkn gender. And sometimes I've instinctually stopped myself from going too fast. And that hasn't made me less trans, it's just made me *more healthily* trans by doing what's right for me.

To all my comrades in transitioning, I just want to remind you: go at your own pace (fast or slow!), move steadily, and do not be discouraged. The progress you will see in the mirror and in your mind is amazing, but it is not overnight."
Princess_Catherine,asktransgender,Why transition if I will always just be a man?,"Hi.

I've been listening to a couple of the more right-leaning trans Youtubers such as Blaire White, Yorick, and Theryn Meyer for the past months, as I got very sick of what felt like a hivemind mentality when it came to discussing being transgender both as it fits in society and your own sense of self. I like to listen to people's opinions, as it gives me more to think about, plus I felt the need to expand my views on transgenderism.

However, and I've been very back and forth on this, I have become more fixated on the concept that, while being trans is not something I was influenced into, forced to be, or any other method of denial, etc. Just because I am like this, does not mean it is ""right"", or ""normal"", or ""natural"".

I feel that, as a collective group, trans people tend to make ideas up to lessen the pain that comes from this reality. I don't know that I could find specific examples, but many statements are made against traditionally believed biological facts in an effort to normalize and destigmatize (I think I spelled that wrong) being transgender. I disagree with this, I think being grounded in reality is important, but the reality of it makes me suicidal.

What it comes down to for me, is the idea that even being transgender in and of itself is not wrong or evil, but that does not mean transitioning through medical and surgical means will make you a man/woman. Just the phrase ""becoming a man/woman"" bothers me, as it means I have been a man my whole life, although I suppose that is true.

I would like to kill myself, but I will do more thinking on this. If I do come to the conclusion that I will always be a man, no matter how happy the idea of being a girl is to me, then I will hopefully be able to kill myself. I do not want to reject reality, and I certainly do not want to be a fake woman or anything similar.

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on these ideas. I suppose I'm hoping for someone to tell me that I am a real girl, but I am fairly sure that is not the case, nor will it ever be. I'd also rather not deal with low effort responses, such as broad blanket statements or ""internet hugs"". 

I'm depressed and hurting, but I want to hear people's truths and beliefs, even if it hurts me."
apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,I really want to transition but I can't accept sterility.,"Title says it all, really ... (Note that I can NOT afford sperm banking.) I'm MtF.

Hell, I don't even *want* kids. The idea of being a (biological) parent to someone is totally foreign to me.

At the same time though, I know people change. I'm 22 now, and I've changed since I was (say) 17 in ways that I could never imagine at the time. I could very well decide I want kids when I'm 27 and ... oops.

And sterility is forever. Even breasts can be surgically removed but nothing is going to restart a dead reproductive system.

This bothers me a lot and I am thinking of stopping estrogen before it's too late (been on a low dose for a month). I don't want to stop but I don't see that I have a choice.

When you don't have it (dysphoria), you don't feel right and you want it to come back, and you are confused because you have no idea what you want to be. You hope it comes back.


But when you have it, you feel depressed, even suicidal but in a way it makes you understand what you want more.






Maybe I am just weird which is why I feel like this, but I sometimes find that dysphoria helps me understand what I want more, whereas no dysphoria makes me really confused and illustrating.

So my leg's been itchy again recently and I can't stop myself from scratching. I took a few pictures and I can't stop crying. I feel so ugly looking at my legs. I'm not sure how I'm going to pass with legs like these. It all happened when I started waxing my legs in July 2015. Since then I've been getting itchy legs from either leg hair regrowth, ingrown hair, razor burn. I have NEVER shaved my leg before. It's only waxing (every 4 weeks) or I pluck with a tweezer in between.

Last year I did go to a professional salon to do my waxing (it's the place I went for my laser hair removal and electrolysis), but the issue is still there. I get so itchy and I can't stop scratching and this is the result. 

It's been 5 months of HRT but my leg hairs are still so thick. TBH I really don't know what's going on. I had very Low T levels to begin with, my other body hairs are very light, even my facial hair has been 90% obliterated after 4 months of laser hair removal + electrolysis. 

Could someone please tell me that these hairs will become thinner and thinner on HRT? I'm feel so cursed to have such bad leg hairs. Also, what's wrong with my legs? I think they look very dry? But I'm seriously applying so much cetaphil lotion on it Everyday and this is the result still. 

I can't stop crying. I hate my legs and my bad skin so much. I love wearing shorts and skirts and I don't know how I'm going to wear them when my legs are so ugly. :'("

Where I had to adjust dosages or even stop because med shortage or loss(I self med and finances were short a couple times... horrible.) My general dosage has been 200mg spiro and 4mg Estrofem daily. I also had Progesterone for a while but haven't lately. I have a lot of extra money now and will be buying in bulk soon. Now here's my questions though and it's a few of them.. I hope they can be answered. 

I have lost a lot of muscle but not enough in my biceps. Also my hairline in trying to round out again but it is going too slowly(though it is happening finally) Is there a stronger T blocker than Spiro that will solve both these issues better? I REALLY want smaller petite cuter arms! I can't stand my 13.5 inch biceps.

Second Question: Will I get better feminization from Injections? If so how do I take it? The pharmacy I get my hrt from always sells out on the large injection dose. They typically have the ""Progynon Depot 10mg/ml 1ml 10 Vials/Pack"" though. If I get this how much do I actually inject myself a month or week, in order to get optimal feminization? Is it really only one vial a week or month? The description for dosing on the site confuses me.

SquidgyBubbles,asktransgender,Do trans people's sexualities influence the speed of their self-discovery?,"I was just thinking about those lucky trans women who know that their assigned gender does not match their identity from an early age, when I remembered something that Blanchard supposedly said. I know that the majority (if not all) of his work is theoretical, executed through a biased filter, and based on very questionable foundations at best, but it's a point that I'm mulling over.

Anyhow, when categorising his two types of trans women (apologies to the erasure of bisexual trans women), he said that straight trans women often recognise their trans identity during a primary developmental stage in their early childhood years (roughly age 4-7). On the other hand, gay trans women tend to recognise their trans identity later, during a secondary developmental stage, i.e. puberty or later.

Now, I am a gay trans woman. I'm sure all trans people can point to gender atypical behaviour in their childhood, and I'm no different. However, I personally didn't think much about being trans until I was around 21. Although I had an unfathomable feeling of being gay for quite a while despite living as male and being attracted only to women, it still took me a long time to come to this realisation because I had no convincing reason to question myself. As such, I am somewhat envious of those people who realised they were trans at an early age.

Hopefully all this background information makes sense when I ask my questions:

Do you think straight trans people are able to identify as trans earlier on in their lives as they are prompted by questioning their (assigned-sex) homosexuality? 

Do you think gay trans people tend to identify later on in life because questioning being (assigned-sex) straight in a heteronormative society is just not something people tend do?

Do straight trans people really even identify as trans earlier on than gay trans people, or is that more nonsense from Blanchard?

I've also heard that the trans women population is roughly one-third straight, one-third gay, and one-third asexual. This seems absurdly clear-cut when cis populations are estimated to be only 5-10% gay.

I suppose this can only yield anecdotal results, but I'd be interested to see what people think on the matter. I'd be grateful for the all-seeing perspective of any bi people too.

Someone please just clarify the vortex of nonsense that surrounds trans sexuality for me!"

So I was wondering are there any transgender men who are not in to (or even hate) those kind of things?
And if so, I can imagine that your coming out was maybe a bit harder than other transgender men who like the ""manly man"" stuff. I can imagine that people say things like ""Are you sure you're trans because you don’t like sports/craft beers/tuxedos etc.""
How do you deal with this? Do you like 'fake it'? For example, act like you are in to sports just because people will believe you more that you're trans?

We are both 18 and still in high school. We've been together for 8 months, but we've been friends for like 3 years. I want to transition soon, and I'm currently in the process of getting hrt. I've been out to everyone as non-binary for a while, using they/them pronouns. And my bf was fine with that and totally supportive, correcting our friends on correct pronoun usage and such. But, now that I've come out to him as a trans woman, he says he's not sure if he wants to stay with me if I transition. He has always identified as ""mostly gay"" but has said he does like some women. He's dated cis women in the past and was happy with it. 
I need help figuring out what to do. If you have any resources for people who's partner comes out as trans I could send to him that would be great, or just some general advice. I really love him, and I don't want to lose him. Thank you."
[deleted],asktransgender,"Tired of feeling ""wrong"" for my gender non-conformity.","Hey all. I have a situation. So, as you can see by my tag line, I'm a trans woman who also identifies as butch / GNC. I want a female body but don't want to dress or present in a feminine manner. At first I identified as nonbinary before I figured out this was even an option (two years into transition). 

With that aside, I get so much flak for my gender presentation from well-meaning, but imho kinda ignorant, binary trans and non-trans friends. I get misgendered sometimes, and I get constantly told by friends to femme up my appearance: long hair, dresses, skirts, blouses, the whole nine. What they don't understand is that presenting like that makes me just as uncomfortable as presenting male. I'm a woman, my body is as close to female as possible, but I'm just not feminine. I feel like I'm being held to a different standard than a non-trans woman on this, like I have no right to be anything other than a blouse-wearing, purse-carrying femme.

Would any of you have advice for how to deal with these well-meaning invalidations?

I'm not going to change how I look or be someone I'm not, and I just hope to find a strategy for when friends criticize me for not being a ""proper lady."" I feel like I'm starting to lose friends over rejecting their advice, and I don't want that to happen. "
georgemitch,asktransgender,I don't believe I am not passable... I keep looking around at school and A LOT of women are actually more masculine looking than me in some aspects.,"I want to seek help. Last time I posted a selfie here and received some feedback. That photo was taken at a very close angle, someone told me I looked strange. Also I released that photo together with my backstory that explains I am a guy, so people might have a bias when looking at that photo. I don't believe I am that masculine looking. I mean if a cisgender woman take a close up selfie with no makeup, they might look masculine as well.

I have taken some new photos, I keep looking at them, I really don't think I am as ugly or scary as some people described. I had made some unpopular comments before so maybe those people were just haters that want to make me miserable. I really don't think I am that bad looking. I was told that I looked like a ""stray dog"", it was obvious I was a guy in drag, etc. Really? But also some people told me they weren't sure if I was a guy or a girl. Those users had been very kind and truthful to me in the past when I needed help, so I really don't think they were lying to me. 

What is the truth? I am very confused. I don't want to deceive myself that I am good looking, I surely am not, but I don't think I am *that* ugly.

Long time lurker, first post here in r/asktransgender.

Secondly I will introduce myself a bit, I am a 22 year old MtF living in Sydney and I am having a bit of trouble and was wondering if anyone had any advice.

I moved around a lot as a kid and spent a lot of time overseas, so my 'boymode' accent is a mishmash of a variety of accents from all over the globe. With multicultural parents also, my male speaking voice is odd in itself. I have done years of acting and voice acting and am confident in my true feminine voice however I am struggling with defining an accent that works for me!

Naturally I speak with a New Zealand accent, where I grew up. But living in Australia I am compelled to speak with an Australian twang. When I use my true feminine voice with either of these accents.. it doesn't feel right! I would love to have an ancestral accent like my Scandinavian family members but I don't speak Norwegian and don't want to come across as a fake! So far nothing seems to feel natural and I don't want to progress with voice training until I have found my groove, so to speak.

Any advice from anyone out there? Thank you!"

The_Gibbens,asktransgender,"Seven months, twenty days in HRT... Still look and feel male.","I've been on spiro and various forms of e since July 1st, and I look roughly the same. My hair is longer, which led me being male-failed twice from behind (yay!) only to have immediate, over-enthusiastic apologies thrown at me once I turn around. I dress pretty male (jeans, tshirt, hoodie) so I take I can pass at least a little bit while in ""boy-mode"" (something I feel I haven't ever actually stepped out of), and that doesn't bug me at all. What bugs me is my face.

I have a pretty ""male"" face, down to the eyebrows, jawline, browbone, adam's-fuckin'-apple, everything. On top of that I have my voice, which I would only describe as ""neck-beardy"" bordering on ""amateur baritone"". All of these things makes it really hard to look in the mirror, talk for long on the phone, or even take care of myself without feeling lost and pointless.

Most days, I sit at my computer and play video games, watch the news, or stare at it w/o purpose (literally, like, doing nothing but watching my desktop slideshow scroll by) instead of anything productive, like looking up laser for my terribly ingrown, wiry, and deep facial hair. The money I could have saved up, I either blow on cheap calories and carbs (adding to a slight weight problem...), videogames to distract me, or booze.

I'm in a rut, TLDR, and I've had this rut for a really long time.

I'm not sure if I'm actually asking a question here, truth be told. I'm just posting here to get it off my chest. It's taking a tole on my life, from work to health, and I think talking about it with people who might have been going through situations like mine might help.

throwaway022117,asktransgender,Intermittent Dysphoria = Transgender?,"I'm 22 and for at least 10 years have had intermittent dysphoria.  I'll sometimes go a few months without my gender really being on my mind, yet some nights I ""binge"" (paint my nails, put on makeup, put on different clothes etc) because I can't handle it.  Most of the time it's somewhere in the middle - I wear women's underwear under my usual men's clothes about half of the time, for example.

I've thought about thinking about transitioning before, but I've always thought that since *most* of the time I'm comfortable enough with my gender, I'm not really trans.  I'm also a real all or nothing kind of person in general... so when I picture what my body might be like after transitioning... it's not exactly appealing.  However, when I picture myself in an ""ideal"" way it makes me feel amazing.

Anyway, tonight's one of the ""binge"" nights and I was reading a popular thread here that said something along the lines of ""cis people don't worry about their gender every day"".  And it makes me feel like I'm stuck, I don't even know if I'm trans or not.

Sorry for rambling.  Just feeling overwhelmed.  Not really sure what the point is.

edit: I should add, it's not just dysphoria.  It's other parts of my life that are... different as well.  I've never connected with other males at all.  I haven't had a male friend (something more than an acquaintance) since before puberty.  100% of my friends are females and it's been that way for years.  I feel so much more comfortable around them and I notice I act much more feminine around them compared to at work for example.

Is this typical for trans people or not related?"
themizukitty,asktransgender,[MtF] Worried my Dysphoria is Destroying my Relationship,"Hey all.

I just hit my 7 month mark on E, but I've still been experiencing enormous bouts of dysphoria and depression. I'm afraid it's making me push my partner away. We've been living together for about 2.5 weeks, dating for 7 years. (engaged for almost two of those). 

Lately I haven't been feeling the same flutter in my heart that I normally would, when I see her, and I've been having issues sexually also. (specifically I haven't been able to orgasm during sex)

She's incredibly supportive of me, and since living together, there's only two, maybe three annoying habits she does which bug me.  (I'm sure I'm far worse anyways). All of the relationship problems we've been having are my fault, from depression (either due to dysphoria, or my weight), and the occasional physical problems (most recently incredibly tight lower back, and possibly sciatica. I have a desk job, where I'm not out) which prevents me at being the best I can for her, and for our new place. 

I'm worried I'm going to destroy her, the relationship, and everything we have.

EDIT: Unsure of it's relevance, but I was told recently by my doctor that my estrogen levels are actually high (3mg pills), but prior to the move there was an issue with getting my Spiro refilled, and I was off T blockers for a week at the end of January, which is when the majority of this seems to have started. I also just started progesterone about two weeks ago (which I've heard can cause more depression)"

I obviously have a long way to go, but I have noticed slight skin changes, smell changes, and a tiny small little bit of breast development. And I know the testicles will get small too over time.

But it looks bizarre. One is huge, and the other is barely noticeable. It actually looks like the sac is almost sideways, and I can see the circumcision scar far easier than before.

I don't remember how big they were before I started, so I don't have that reference, but I'm scared that the one that is big is even bigger than originally.

If this is normal and it happens, that's great. It looks really weird but I can live with that.

If it sounds concerning and I should go see someone, I'd definitely like to do that soon.

Thanks! "
allen476,asktransgender,Started HRT yesterday.,"I could have started Monday but I decided to wait until yesterday when I had the self-injection class at Planned Parenthood. It took two weeks to get the hormones straightened out due to my not being able to have pill form and a shortage of injectable estrogen. We ended up going with patches for estrogen and injections of progesterone. 

I am quite near the 100 pound mark of weight loss since the gastric bypass. My goal of losing 250 pounds actually seems really doable at this point. I no longer think that it is all a pipe dream. People that I haven't seen since before I had surgery are amazed already at how I look. 

I really don't see the changes though. The only thing I notice is that my stomach is smaller and I can finally see all the way down. Some medical things that started to spring up are going back to normal. Two ulcers on my leg are healing. I am getting feeling back in my left leg in some areas. I no longer walk with a limp. The severe edema in both of my legs is completely gone. I went from a mean measurement of my ankle of 14.25 inches to 10.5 inches. I can finally wear shoes that I haven't worn in years. 

For the first time in my life I am happy with myself. Realistic goals and achieving them has really changed my perspective. My next goal is to start electrolysis in 3 months. Between getting my hairs zapped off, HRT kicking in, and losing weight to reach my goal weight of 175, I'll be happy when that all ends and I can start living full-time. I give myself around two years for the next stage knowing that electrolysis takes a long time to finish. 

Just a small update. "
jenn4u,asktransgender,I don't know what to do anymore,"Originally I thought that if I kept the best attitude towards transition, I would be able to get through this no matter how unpassable I was. Now it just seems that it was all a lie that I told others and myself, so I didn't feel hopeless. 

A few days ago I went out jogging and some random gay guy started flirting, didn't think that would make me feel so horrible, to only be liked because I'm a ""guy"". Today in particular is what set me off though. I don't know what brought up a convo between my brother and dad. My brother asked what was the issue with trans people using the bathroom. To which my dad replied, ""well guys probably won't mind women going into the men's room but most women don't want to share a bathroom with men in dresses"". So naturally I got all sad about my dad's views about the issue, which my mom saw and tried to comfort me. Her words, ""you have to grow a thick skin"" ""what are you going to do in 5 years when people are making fun of you on the train, or when you get called out for using the women's room"", doing the exact opposite of comforting. I guess I had some stupid dream that there was even a 1% chance that I would ever pass after a bunch of FFS. Never occurred to me that my parents are supportive but to them I'll always just be some giant delusional man in a dress. When I started HRT I never really thought about what would happen if I could never pass, if I ever had to go through life with a society that only supported me because they felt sorry that I was trans and not a women, I honestly wouldn't even want to live. I know that sounds horrible to say considering there are many ""non passing"" individuals, but I just wanted to live a semi normal life without others having to pretend they are okay with calling me a  woman no matter how masculine I look. Shoulders are too broad, my face is 30k away from being fixed and my head would still be too long and wide, throw in a deep voice and being 6'4, I honestly have no idea what drugs I was on when I thought this would work out. I've come to the conclusion that my only option is to go on pretending I'm okay with looking masculine, enjoying the other effects of hormones until I give up. Sorry I know this was only just a rant but I really needed to vent."

Poop30,asktransgender,Transitioned 4 years ago mtf. Now wondering if I've actually been non-binary this whole time. Is this a thing?,"I've been presenting as female full time for years. Hrt, name change, hair removal, everything short of srs that I could do for the sake of living as a female had been done at this point. And I'm fine with where I am. 

However, I've always felt uncomfortable in other trans or queer spaces. Gender Identity and expression always seemed like such an afterthought for me and getting caught up in it is something I actively avoid now. There was never a shift in interests or anything else associated with gender with my transition. I've never identified as a guy, but honestly, female just always felt like a default, not something I connect with. I needed my body a certain way, and I've adjusted to those changes to make things as simple as possible for me. 

I don't even know how I could have gotten this far without being able to label myself as anything other than trans female.  But lately, I've just wanted to avoid the subject altogether. I know what works with my body and the way I'm read by others, so I operate around that to streamline the process as much as possible. Is there another term that fits what I am? "

k-trecker,asktransgender,Switching to fully gender neutral bathrooms?,"So, I used to think gendered restrooms were unnecessary. We have stalls, don't we?

However, I was reading on /r/islam and some people there supported gender neutral restrooms, but wanted to keep the gendered ones too. Islam is a pretty gender segregated religion. They said that some women use the restroom to fix the hijab (which shouldn't be done in front of men) and some people use it to wash before worship.

I'm not trying to start a debate about Islam, but what do you all think about keeping gendered restrooms? I'm on the fence about it. Is it a good compromise?

Slothentic,asktransgender,Faith and being transgender; how has personal faith/trust in someone or thing unseen impacted your journey?,"Over the past few days there's been a few things that have happened that I just really feel like sharing. 

A bit of background; I am MtF, currently closeted (but not much longer) and view my personal faith/relationship with God as a significantly important part of my life. It is currently, and will probably always be more important to me than being transgender.

I love my Church and faith and would not be the same person I am today without it. I also had little/no exposure to the LGBT community, and so when I noticed something different about myself I didn't understand what it was. When I started to see Abigail for the first time I swept her under the carpet and didn't acknowledge who I was and still am. 

To say that I have been scared about telling people is an understatement. Even my parents, both of whom have not only expressed support for the LGBT community but have previously said that they would support and love me if I ever decide something like this, are near impossible to bring it up with because I've felt so scared.

I decided to give the issue to God and pray; the answer I got was a nudge, and a feeling like I needed to talk to someone about this. I also had a profound sense of peace land on me almost like a hug, and all my doubts have just gone away.
With that in mind I talked to my parents yesterday. I've set a day to drop the bombshell on them. The fear is gone and I feel completely at peace with my identity and who I am and I know that I'm right about being a woman not a man. I'm at peace with the fact I will probably lose friends and maybe family over this, and the only thing that has changed is that I put my trust in God.

Hopefully that sort of makes sense. I was really just wondering if anyone else has found their faith or beliefs a refuge or help, or something that they've had to challenge etc... And if anyone else has experiences that they'd be happy to share."
ABC_Bourgeoisie,asktransgender,I got asked about my preferred name today,"So I was at the pharmacy this morning picking up my refill of HRT. One of the employees at the counter gestured for me to come over to him. He kept communicating with gestures and by mouthing words, so it was clear he wasn't able to speak, at least at the moment.

After grabbing my bottle of pills from the back, he looked at the label, and then back up at me with a confused expression on his face. 

He started rapidly scribbling something down on a sticky note and handed [it](http://i.imgur.com/629o3MP.jpg) to me. He asked if I wanted him to put a note for my preferred name in the system! I've been going to this pharmacy for months without anybody caring enough to ask ._.

So not only was this guy working hard to do his best to communicate without talking, but he was even the only employee that was considerate enough to actually take my gender identity into account. He was so sweet and I want to call the pharmacy back tomorrow and tell them how great he was.

It made me so happy that I wanted to share it with all of you. That's all :)"
feelinqueer,asktransgender,Any recommendations on Dr.'s for HRT in the Dallas area?,"So I can get a referral letter from my counselor at any time and I am trying to find the best Dr. I can get for starting HRT. I preferably want one that doesn't have a long waiting list if one at all and is preferably knowledgeable in prescribing, monitoring, etc. with HRT.

My counselor suggests Dr. Aimee Wright, and claims that Dr. Wright has about 1/3rd transgender patients that are happy with her services including clients of my counselor and they have a sort of informal professional trade off. But I don't want to just pick her at default I want to explore my options. Has anyone used Dr. Wright and were you happy with her? I saw a post about her not being very knowledgeable but that was posted 3 years ago.

I have also considered Dr. Patrick Daly, he has done some activism for Trans rights which is encouraging and he seems very respectful of everything, but I've also heard that he has too many clients and is often swarmed with patients. Has anyone used Dr. Daly and were you happy with him?

Here are the other doctors that I know of but I'm not particularly interested and I'll tell you why for each, but if anyone has positive experiences with them please tell me.

Dr. Steven Dorfman: I hear that his staff is disrespectful and he doesn't take the time to even see you most of the time. (Just rumors/reviews though).

Dr. Jaime Vasquez: I hear he has a very long waiting list and barely does HRT as a side note. I heard that his waiting list was like over 6 months!? :O

Dr. Paul Worrel: From what I understand he only monitors HRT patients, so doesn't seem like the best option because I want to be able to deal with the Dr. directly preferably. But other than that I can't find much about him.

Dr. William Sheldon: I've pretty much only heard bad things, and apparently takes forever to get you your meds...

So if anyone has any information on any of these doctors I would greatly appreciate it, especially on Dr. Wright and Dr. Daly as I have already heard good things and not many bad things other than the ones I listed. Also is it common for there to be wait lists for HRT still? Like I said Dr. Vasquez supposedly had a waiting list of 6+months but that information is over a year old so I'm not sure if this is common or not because that is the first time I've ever heard of a wait time that long in the US. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"

2) SRS is risky and costly. Even if I don't do SRS, I wont be able to get grandchildren and it makes him sad.

3) He has a complete neutral view and has plans for me to see a counsellor, but it will make him very sad.

ChanelNumberOne,asktransgender,Is a protein deficit a good idea for muscle loss of you are already eating a caloric deficit?,"So I'm mtf just for clarification but this could apply to anyone I suppose. I currently aim to eat 1300 calories a day (usually end up eating 1400 or so though). I have noticed muscle atrophy but I also eat roughly 30-70g of protein a day. 

I could cut protein out more and reduce that but I honestly love protein and would hate to do that. I've already lost a good amount of weight, down to 135 from 160. I'm just curious about your opinions on whether or not cutting protein would speed up the process, I'm not sure f t would be necessary with such a significant caloric deficit.

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,I want to come out sooner than later but I need help getting past some denial,"As the title of the post says, I am tore between what I should do. I want to come out to one of my parents because since I am sixteen (AMAB) it's the only way I can see a therapist and the reason I want to see a therapist is because I feel like I can only get so far with self-questioning before I get to basically the point I am at, anything that I feel I can slightly relate to my mind is like ""Oh no, they were FOURTEEN when they felt like that you're SIXTEEN so there is no way you are anything alike!"". I can see three posts on here and starting feeling more confident before I see one post that only is not even negative but that SLIGHTLY makes me doubt, thus pushing me back with denial. I do have certain posts that always seem to make me feel more confident in me being transgender but it's not always enough.

That is where the problem comes with coming out, how can I possibly come out if even I am unsure of it? It goes forwards and backwards on how sure I am and I don't particularly see why I am worried as my family is  very much liberal with my oldest gay brother being engaged to his fiancee. I don't have any extreme dysphoria, such as with my genitals (besides masturbation) though I wish I did and I know how STUPID that sounds but if I did feel like that, it's the difference between following the yellow brick road, knowing where I'll end up and having a set path towards there because of severe dysphoria or just being told my destination is within a 5000 mile radius of my starting position so I should try to find it on my own before I get into my thirties if I am lucky because I don't have severe dysphoria. Maybe I am just in denial about what dysphoria is or maybe what I think I am 'faking' is really really real.

Another stupid thing that I think to myself very often is that ""I WANT to be trans because that is the only way that I can be a girl"" which is most likely the most stupid thing someone in denial has ever said who then STAYED in denial but maybe I just need a dose of outside validation, not that I am 100% trans but that someone who is trans would definitely say something like that because I still need to see a therapist sooner or later, hopefully while I am young, like now.

I know most of the people that will respond to this will most likely say that I can only come out when I am READY but I can only really see two paths happening, I just suppress it for a long ass time/get stuck in a endless cycle of questioning OR one of my parents confront me before I feel confident in myself, if you can provide examples from experience or the slightest little bit of advice, that would be awesome. 

Finally, I am wondering about two ""signs"" of being trans and if I could really bring them up if I were to come out as well, separate from coming out are they even valid? The first is that for as LONG as I can remember, I have been thinking about transformation stuff, which as you can guess a lot of it was imagining becoming a girl and being quite happy with such a thought, though I wouldn't feel SINCERE if I said this while coming out, as if I am lying to myself and anyone I am telling. Lastly, I have NEVER EVER cross-dressed (except for ONCE or TWICE at my daycare when I was really young trying on princess dresses) and though I know not all people that are trans have, I am just curious, could it be because I literally had no foreseeable way to start cross-dressing without any female siblings? As well, I could never think of doing it because I used the computer as basically an escape to any negative feelings, I know that is basically a impossible question to answer but I might as well ask it.

I am sorry that this became a wall of text and that it will most likely be hard to answer and how it also became half ""coming out"" and half ""does this equal trans?"""

All the gender theory I've read has been from binary trans people describing feeling like a man or woman and feeling at peace once their body reflects their gender, which they compare to cis people. I'm read as a cis person I suppose, but I don't have a sense of peace with femininity or being read as a woman or anything. I just don't have any internal experience or reaction to it, and I'm beginning to think that's not normal.

cfour515,asktransgender,Help figuring out gender.,"I am an AMAB trans person who usually tells people I'm a transwoman. The thing is I don't fully identify as a binary woman, and I'm not sure the reason for it. When I was first questioning my gender, I thought I was nonbinary. Later when I finally admitted to myself that I was transgender, I thought I was a binary trans woman. Now, I am not so sure. Right now, I use transfeminine to define myself, but would like to figure out my identity further. I use a female name, she or they pronouns (most people just use feminine ones), and dress androgynously. My hair is shoulder length, I paint my nails but keep them short, and I don't wear makeup. I like the term genderqueer woman, because I feel like I'm not a binary woman and genderqueer feels like a fuck you to normative ideas of gender. I'm not sure if I identify with it because of transmisogyny though. I don't know if I don't feel like I fit the binary because I am a tomboyish, androgynous transwoman. I know that wouldn't make me less of a woman, but I can't help but feel like it is a part of it.

vap0r-32,asktransgender,Did your face change after you realised you were trans?,"After coming out to my mum as ftm in August last year, in the last few days I've finally managed to start up a dialogue about it without too much trouble. This time last year our relationship was becoming quite strained because she had developed an unhealthy obsession with the idea of me being in a relationship with this particular guy that I thought I had a crush on. For me, going along with it, this was my last ditch attempt to be the sickeningly sweet straight girl that was expected from me and I feel horrible about it.

So yesterday evening, after not talking about it for a long time, she suddenly comes out with this comment that while she thought I loved this guy I was beautiful and feminine, and now that I think I'm a man I look completely different. Recently my skin has reverted back to its acne prone state that I had while I was younger, but apart from that I feel pretty offended. I haven't even socially transitioned yet - all that's changed is the clothes I'm wearing and how I feel about myself - which is in a very positive way now that I've accepted who I am. The worse part is she used to say this kind of thing when I was younger (and presenting in a masculine way) too. I would ask her if I was attractive and she would say ""you could be"".

Has anyone else in this sub ever wondered or felt that simply realising you're trans is enough to change how you look facially? Or worse - had these kind of comments from people in your life?"

I have gender related dysphoria in a way that ftm guys have it, I dot like my wide hips and love my strong legs and body hair, but when it comes to relationships I feel like a girl (as of now I present as gay and I am bottom). But when I think of having vagina I get aroused kind of. When I imagine my self I can't see me as woman but i also can't imagine my self as man, and I am trying not to be hard on my self and to let my mind wonder. When I feel girly I feel kind of euphorick but than it allso can be gayish feeling which makes me confused. Does anyone of you gets aroused when imagine yourself having vagina? Do you and how often you masturbate (I do it 2-3 times a day) and what do you masturbate to (the only porn that gets me on is gay porn since I don't find woman attractive) "

Metastasis3,asktransgender,Is Sylveon a transgender symbol/easter egg ?,"Hi everyone,
I recently picked up a plushie of Sylveon, and I noticed that its colors were absolutely the same as the transgender flag some friends in an LGBT association showed me a while ago.
Plus, Sylveons looks somewhat androgynous with a bow at their neck (masculine fashion) and on their heads (feminine fashion).

So, crypto-LGBT symbolism in Pokemon ?

For those that haven't catched up on the latest generations, Sylveons are an eveelution of (the new) type fairy that looks like [this] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/b/bf/700Sylveon_Pokemon_Super_Mystery_Dungeon.png)"

heyycaleb,asktransgender,Is it bad that I'm suppressing my trans self and sexuality completely???,"Honestly I'm so fed up with standing out at school. All of my friends that know about my gender treat me a little different than their cis friends I feel and some also know I like girls and think it's ""weird"". I'm probably never going to pass as male because my mom isn't letting me express myself as freely as I wish, so it's probably better for me to pretend I'm not trans. For the trans thing, I'll just let my hair grow out long and dress feminine. For my sexuality, I'm planning on just going out with guys although I have no attraction to them whatsoever. I'm going to be extremely depressed I already know, but I'd fit in. I'd probably go on in life to act like a cishet woman although I feel like a transhet guy. Is this a horrible idea or not?? "

masonjar64,asktransgender,Is the process of getting HRT daunting to anyone else?,"I'm 19, FtM, and I've been out for two years. I had it in my head that I would try to start hormones as soon as I got to college, which was a few months after I came out. I had an appointment at my university's health center to talk about it, but the nurses there were so horrible I never went back.

Now, I feel like I've made no progress in my transition and I'm still apprehensive to find somewhere that will help me start HRT. I also have severe depression and anxiety which add to that, mostly affecting making phone calls and appointments and a general fear of hospital environments. There's so many hoops I have to jump through in my area when I do eventually go see someone, anyway. It's become kinda of a cloud hanging over my head that I can't shake off. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this, and how did you get past it?"

L051ngMy3dg3,asktransgender,"Worried my friends are overconfident, any advice on safety at the beach?","Ok, so here's my problem right now. I'm going on spring break to Ft. Lauderdale next week, and we usually spend a lot of time on the beach or at the pool there. I've been on HRT for like 3-ish months now, and while I think I'm getting closer to passing, my family still tells me (without realizing its kinda hurtful) that I still look exactly the same. My plan (established months ago when I thought hormones might work really fast) was to just go swimming with a one-piece and board shorts, but now I'm worried about my safety. My super supportive friends always tell me that it will be fine and that they will come to my defense if people decide to say something, but I feel like I'm going to be harassed or confronted, and while I'm used to getting shitty stares (I dress pretty feminine despite not passing), I live in Boston and don't really worry as much about being confronted bc people are used to seeing weird people in large cities. So what do you guys think, bad idea? I know Florida is a pro-Trump state and especially with all the stuff in the news right now I'm kinda afraid. "
thr0wnaway101,asktransgender,"Came out very positively, but I still have some doubts. . . .","This is mostly me gushing about a great experience with a little bit of a question at the end.

I've been ridiculously nervous about bringing this up to *anybody*, even though I've technically done it before a number of years ago, but I felt that I couldn't keep it from my mom anymore--at the very least I had to tell her that I'm dealing with the fact that I might be trans (or probably am? Definitely am? It's still confusing).

Short story is, though I was prepared for the worst, I pretty much called her up and was like ""Hi, how's your day been, here's what's been going on with me lately,"" and her reaction could not have been better. She didn't freak out or anything, she actually said she felt relieved that I told her and that I was working toward happiness. She told me she thought I was an amazingly strong person. And she even asked ""does this mean I might have a daughter some day?""

Absolutely nothing could have prepared me for that.

This is a major thing for me, and even though I don't necessarily feel any more certain about what's going to happen or what the future holds (seriously, unscrambling the repression is a *nightmare*), I'm just elated that I at least have this support.

Even by the end of the same phone call, though, I found myself feeling afraid that maybe I was going too fast and maybe this all wasn't true, etc etc. It's so much closer now, so much more real.

That's gotta just be jitters, right? I've seen plenty of posts about how one moment you feel absolutely sure you're trans and you know what you want, and the next moment it's all out the window and you're just scared and lost again.

Ultimately, what I ended on was telling her that ""even if this doesn't go where I think it will, it's definitely a part of me and I shouldn't deny that."" This sub has been very helpful in the long, arduous process of figuring myself out, so thank you all very much and I hope you all have some similar positivity in your futures."
123aaa1,asktransgender,"I might be transgender, this is how I have been feeling.","I am 21 and AMAB. I have been questioning my gender for over a month now. I have felt unhappy most of my life. The one time I was happier was early on in high school. At that time I was coming out as bi, and I think that let me feel comfortable with acting a little more feminine than I had before. That was also before a lot of the effects of male puberty had really taken hold.

Body wise I used to be ok I think in the past, but it feels like things are kind of getting a little worse now. For a long time my facial hair came in slower and in smaller amounts than it does now. It feels like if I had a beard it would be awkward and almost like I was a different person. Being clean shaven feels like a big relief. I don’t really like how my arms are getting more muscly than they used to be. I feel like looking like a skinny teenage boy with longish hair was ok, but that can’t last forever. I have been keeping my hair on the longer side since before I started high school, basically since I started choosing what to do with it myself. I will let it grow for a while, then get it cut shortish, then let it grow for months and repeat the process. I feel awkward getting haircuts. I really do not want to have short hair as a permanent thing, I would hate that I think.

My voice is on the higher side for a guy and I like that. When it comes to exercise I walk and run sometimes and am very put off by the idea of lifting weights because I really don’t want to be muscly like that. I have recently been shaving basically all my body hair and that feels better than when I was not doing that. I don’t really like having photos of myself out publicly, I take photos of myself sometimes but mostly keep them to myself. I feel awkward when it comes to clothing, so mostly I just wear plain T-shirts and jeans because that is easy and I understand it. I have noticed recently that a lot of my anxiety is heightened in areas of life connected with gender expression.

I feel awkward when it comes to names, including my own. My name feels like an official form of identification to be put on forms and school work, rather than a living representation of my identity. If someone uses it, it feels a little awkward. I like my name in some ways, but it doesn’t seem to be getting the job done really. I have been thinking of myself sometimes with a girl’s name which I like and sounds kind of similar to mine and I think I like that better. Socially I have had a lot of social anxiety. I have the feeling of being fake somehow or risking being fake. My sense of self is much more built on my accomplishments and past than on being a specific person in the present. I don’t feel like a full unified person sometimes. I have felt a lot of negative feelings about myself over the years. 

For the past month I have been constantly reading about gender and being trans and reading the transgender subreddits. I have been going from thinking of myself as a girl, to thinking that couldn’t possibly be true, and back again. Thinking of myself as a girl I have more empathy for myself and feel more unified. It feels like as a guy I have no sense of gender and a constant baseline awkwardness with everything, and thinking of myself as a girl feels liberating. I’m also totally unable to think of myself as a “man” which feels a lot worse than “boy or “guy.” A few months ago it felt like I was destined to be miserable my whole life and that I would never be happy again, but now it seems like maybe that isn’t the case. I am still not sure about all this. The idea of transitioning is scary, but more and more it seems the idea of not transitioning is too. I fear that if I don’t transition in my 20s, then I might end up doing it much later in life and be disappointed I didn’t earlier. My family is also pro LGBT, so that is good. I don’t know my gender identity 100% right now, but at least internally I no longer see myself as a guy. I guess I’m posting this here because I want to get how I have been feeling out there. Maybe people can relate. This has been very difficult dealing with all this."
michaelgcliffor,asktransgender,I feel depressed.,"The past four months have been pretty amazing for me. I came out to my guidance counsellor at school, one of my teachers called me Kodee in class, and the majority of my friends were supportive. For the most part I was genuinely happy. 
Everything is sinking in right now. Everything that I've been missing for the past few months, like the rumors about me in school and how people don't believe me. WHY WOULD I FAKE BEING TRANS? I can't stop crying- for the life of me I can't understand it. 
The first friend of mine that I came out to would call me Kodee to my face, but whenever she was in a conversation with anyone else she would refer to me as Kay-Dee. I didn't know, and I feel like a FOOL. Her and I had an argument, and she was telling RANDOM FRIENDS OF HERS that I have boobs and that I am not a boy. She referred to me as ""the she"" to one of her close friends. I thought she supported me? I thought she understood, because she told me she did... I don't even know right now.
I'm sorry that this is probably such a messy post but my mind is a mess.
I am feeling paranoid that my guidance counselor doesn't believe me. I know for a fact that my mom doesn't believe me, neither does my grandma. My grandpa, my favourite person ON THIS FUCKING PLANET is transphobic- I haven't come out to him yet. I'm actually not allowed to talk to him right now because of my mom. I just started crying again I cant handle everything.
One of my friens that I came out to told me that they were Gender fluid when I told them that I'm trans. I was happy knowing that they would be someone that I could come to and talk to whenever I need anything, or any advice, but I was wrong. This supposed friend literally ignores that I'm trans every single day, and purposely calls me Kay-Dee all the time. 
I mainly hang out with two people, one of them is TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE AND SUCH A FUCKING GREAT FRIEND. I love her so much, shes amazing. We'll be talking and she'll be like ""Omg Kodee did you see Gaga's new album cover"" or something like that, and my other friend will be like ""I don't think Kay-Dee has seen it yet, [friend]. SHE doesn't pay close attention to her"". Like idk it just makes me feel like absolute shit because I came out to her and everything and she told me that she was okay with it and she gave me a hug and said that she understood and that they're genderfluid and like idk I use their preferred name 24/7, and they can't do the same in return?? 
I guess this is turning out to be more of a rant type post sorry :/. 
Does anyone know how I can talk to my friend again and ask if they can use my name and pronouns? I don't want to nag them but I'm beginning to feel upset and stressed out over thi s

I've thought and been told, that this might be dysphoria and a sign of desiring a female body. Though because of the fact that I've always sexually fantasies as female, including imagining having a female body during said fantasies, that this imagining is simply carrying over from these fantasies. In other words, that I'm imagining this when I see a girl due to being used to it in my fantasies and it being a way of turning me on also.

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Timelines are making me anxious,"I am 16 which sounds like a good age to start with but I got probably more masculine features and problems (receding hairline, big forehead, strong jaw/chin, alot of body hair, tall) than anybody my age.

I have seen timelines where they were feminine as a boy and turned out looking like an actual girl and were really pretty. And there is the other half that doesn't turn out pass at all or looks like a pretty masculine woman. 

It makes me anxious and frustrated as I am not at all as feminine as the trans girl my age and when I see how the other turn out, I really hate myself for not outing myself before puberty and I want to turn out really feminine and not like this. I am anxious all the time, get really really frustrated over seeing trans girls which will look by far better than I ever will and just lie in bed and continuously lose hope to look good and feminine at the end of my transition and lose my will to live. For example [Eden the Doll](https://www.instagram.com/edenthedoll/?hl=de) makes me feel actually so depressed as I can never reach something like she did.

I want my body to get to a point that it is as feminine as the cis girl my age even though I know this is not possible. But it would have to smooth out alot, get the proportions right (not a big upper body but a big lower body) and give me actual curves. From [this](https://imgur.com/a/ygaFW) to something that is considered as a [attractive feminine body](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/23/4e/8a/234e8a0bfd01ed877a4ce1735c9690b4.jpg) including my face of course is probably just a goal that I have, that will probably be always there but always unreachable which makes me really sad as this is one of my biggest goals in life.

Inoxydable90,asktransgender,"Bad experience with medical professionals in Michigan, USA","Sorry in advance for posting this here, it is not heart warming but might be helpful to someone.
I do not want to go into much detail, I want this to be as short as possible and if needed I'll write more but I don't want to as it's difficult since I'm a very shy/private person.

Warning to easily depressed individuals: Don't read further, thanks! 

About me:
At a young age, I knew (a good chance) I likely am transgender but I kept it to myself for typical reasons.
My parents whom are great people, belong to a religion like most people in the US and I believe it has a some correlation to my suffering. 

The belief system my parents share for reasons unknown to me... has a god whom does not approve of being transgender and in general it must be an impossibility related to a mental illness that society has to deal with like all unwanted things. 

My childhood was in a transphobic environment, obstacles existed like today but there was no internet and generally any ""good"" information was scarce.
A lot of bad information based on bigotry was more visible and taught unlike today. 
Society is getting better overall IMO, even with the fear of uncertainty to what President Trump may do with the new administration changes.

Anyway, the challenge of openly disagreeing with my parents about my gender, made me nauseous and anxious with occasional nightmares growing up.
It was too difficult for me as a child to confront, as disagreeing with people I loved would be too much as I would be challenging their belief system and I feared being disowned.

I'm happy now, to be at a point in life where I don't question myself and just do what I want for myself under the circumstances allowed. I did have a happy childhood nonetheless..

Anyway I lived most of my life to now, not doing much to fix me but finally I am and there are few things I want to share with strangers whom have shared so much with me.
 
I've started HRT (DIY) for little over 2 months. I started with patches/pills and I've progressed to injections/pills which honestly has kept me alive. Every little change has been welcomed and I really wish I started sooner but in my mind I understand it was an impossibility. All the events in my life led me to where I am now. I understand how dangerous HRT (DIY) is but i'm making progress towards getting blood work checks.

How did I get to where I am today?

I attempted for years to get medical help in Michigan.
Typically I would be told there is no medical professionals with experience dealing with transgender people. 
I was ignored when vulnerable, told to go elsewhere with no idea of where to go and I believe I was discriminated by my sex.

I ended up hospitalized unjustly at the end of 2015. I vocally expressed repetitively, I should be allowed to leave as I was no threat to myself or anyone and I'm just happily living life all things considered. I'm a university student and was at the time missing course work because of the hospitalization, I later missed out on a semester of university as a result to it all. 

I was assigned a doctor whom I never agreed to a doctor patient relationship. I openly requested a doctor who has dealt with transgender patients and to be moved to a facility with experience in transgender areas or be allowed to leave. None of my requests were honored and just ignored. 

The doctor who was assigned to me, told me he had no experience with transgender people and eventually put schizophrenia as a diagnosis on my records. He court ordered a trial for forced medication, which he won and for reasons unknown to me as I never exhibited any hallucinations or delusions that would fit schizophrenia.

I was stuck in the most uncomfortable situation of my life. 
2 months stuck in a hospital with forced medication which I consider an experience I wouldn't want anyone to ever face.
I could write forever about what I experienced to what I consider a hellish experience but will not. When stuck in hospitalization I attempted everything to get out, called support numbers provided by the hospital which would just be voice mails with nobody every calling back. I contacted my parents whom told the hospital they believed the medication was making me act stupid when saying i'm transgender. One of my parents later disowned me when I left the hospital. The whole thing was really a low time in my life. 

The only reason I'm alive today is by not doubting myself and hoping to see some progress in my life after what I experienced.

I eventually opened a legal case against the people whom wronged me based around negligence, discrimination and my civil &amp; human rights being violated. I don't expect to get anywhere with the case as I'm pro se (broke) and I don't believe my constitutional rights will be honored. I'm facing expensive lawyers saying MI state laws deny my right to a complaint with a bunch of other stuff.. I've been so badly treated by professionals whom expected would protect me but I no longer trust people because of it. The complaint which will probably never be seen by a jury of peers is just my way of creating a public record with my side of the story. It is really complicated with all things and I don't want to go much into it but just acknowledge the truth is that the world is crooked.

Anyway I do have dual citizenship with Canada and plan to get out of the US once I finish my degree which is very soon.
In the meantime, I'm finally am making progress as I have a new name with other stuff and want to express my gratefulness to all the people on here whom have unknowingly given me support throughout my life by sharing life stories &amp; views."
marcocastel,asktransgender,"does your ""deadname"" pops out in your mind from time to time, even after years of not living by that name?","My female name was way uncommon, so I don't heard it on daily basis.  
Still, from time to time it comes out in my mind for no reason.  
I didn't hate my name or anything, it was very special but uncomfortable female, so I changed it to something completely different, since there wasn't a male version.  
Anyway, I don't write it anymore on accident when putting my name on some random paper, but I still think about it sometimes.  
Does it ever goes away? do you think about it too?  
It certainly feels like another person was living by it, at least for me. "
feelinqueer,asktransgender,Overly confident about my transition?,"Sorry for the text wall, I put a TL;DR at the bottom.

I came out to my family about a month or more ago but due to a lack of confidence in how they would react plus general fear on my part I spun it as a more of a questioning rather than I am a transwoman deal with it sort of thing, even though I have been thinking about this for years now, just too scared to do anything. So I get an appointment with a gender therapist (a very experienced one) and had that about 2 weeks ago, that went great I was still nervous about everything but I had known before I went there that I don't want to run from this anymore and I do want to transition and I want to start HRT as soon as my semester ends. My therapist offers me a referral letter for HRT. I tell her I need to talk to my family first and think a little more on it, (plus like I said I want to wait until after this semester because who knows how I will be effected emotionally and what not).

A few days later I talk to my parents, express that I am not really questioning and that I am certain and want to start HRT soonish. They kind of wig out a little bit but are still supportive just scared I guess, mostly because from there perspective I had only recently had thought about this, I tell them otherwise but still this talk isn't the best. A few days later we have another roughish talk. Then finally a few days ago we have a very productive and long talk about it all, I tell them that I'm sure that I'm trans and that I do want to start HRT and make big steps towards transitioning, we talk about a lot of different things associated with it and then we decide that I should see my cardiologist (because I've had some heart problems in the past that were supposed to be dealt with after a surgery a few years ago but still to be certain I'll be safe) and my parents want me to see an Oncologist because I have family history of cancer of both prostate and breast cancer and with being MtF I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least check in with one just in case in the future something turns up. Finally the last thing I'm doing is getting set up with a general practitioner because I don't have one and it'd be best if I could get a baseline of health before going forward just for reference.

With things finally moving forward, I just feel like I'm calmly moving towards what I want. Before all off this I felt like I was trapped and that I would be stuck with these hormones and a body that is getting more damaged by the year and even after coming out for a while I wasn't really truly moving towards steps that I wanted until now. I constantly thought about it and even had points of questioning and telling myself that I don't want to go through the pain or what if I'm not strong enough or can't handle the extra social anxiety of it, constantly thinking and worrying about it.

But now that I do have appointments that will be scheduled soon and my family is aware of my true feelings and just in a position where I just have to try to continue to do well in school but other than that wait/work on other transitioning things like voice, mannerisms, etc. I feel just completely sold, in an aspect in which I don't even think about it sometimes.

I know many might think ""isn't this a good thing"" and I don't know, maybe it is, but I am just so 100% on it that I don't question my thought process anymore I just am going to transition and just have to wait. Sometimes I'll be so fine and okay that I'll think ""do I even need to transition?"" But as I think that I just think ""Lol yes"" almost like I'm at complete ease with it.

It's so strange because I'll be practicing things like make-up or voice training without even thinking about transitioning, even though I'm not presenting, going by my new name, being called correct pronouns, or on hormones yet it's almost like I forget how much further I have to go. Like as if I'm already there somehow? As if I'm just trying to get better at things I like that have nothing to do with my transition even if they almost completely do.

I realized this today because I suddenly got worried that I will stop talking to anyone about it other than my therapy appointments. I think I should be talking about it with my family still and even contemplating everything myself. But I have gotten to the point that it almost feels like a fake amount of certainty. Today I thought ""What if I just don't transition? It would be easier right? Yeah it would be easier, hmm."" The whole time not truly thinking about not transitioning, more like as if day dreaming about how much easier things would be if you had infinite money or something ridiculous like there's no serious thought into it just a casual passing thought. It literally seems ridiculous *not* transitioning to me at this point. As if it's not even an option (which I guess in a lot of ways it's not) and I don't want it to be an option either. Today when trying to figure out what I should do about my eyebrows as far as shaping and cleaning them up I just stopped, looked in the mirror and thought ""that's an attractive guy"" and continued on almost like third person type of shit? An almost disembodied state about it, it was one of the first times that I didn't have a bit of dysphoria looking at my face, because I didn't even associate with it being mine somehow.

This all concerns me a bit because like I said I don't want to just stop thinking and talking to people about it, plus I want to be able to psychologically prepare myself for the hardships ahead, which requires thinking about it. Is this sort of thing typical once you're in a position where things are moving forward and you're just playing the waiting game? Sorry for another horribly long post...

TL;DR: Fairly recently accepted that I am for trans and that I want to start transitioning, (although I have been questioning for years) my family feels like it's going too fast but is still supportive. I have several ""make sure I'll be safe"" appointments set up to be able to confidently start HRT as soon as the Spring semester ends. Now that I have plans in motion I have stopped worrying and have become so confident about transitioning that I am not even thinking about it for hours at a time even though just recently I couldn't stop thinking about it, I feel that I am just playing the waiting game, even though I am actively doing other transitional steps. Afraid that I will alienate my family because I don't even feel the need to talk about it anymore, just 100% certain and waiting. Is this normal to have a calm before the storm type of deal?"

littleshopofhorror,asktransgender,Should I keep binding?,"I'm a very confused nonbinary person who used to identify as a trans guy.

Binding has always been physically uncomfortable for me, but I also felt obligated to do it in order to be respected as a trans guy. Since I have a larger chest, it doesn't even make my chest flat; I just get a weird (but common, so I've heard) uniboob effect no matter how I try arranging things. I also find it very hard to breathe when binding because of my asthma.

I don't really like or dislike my chest, but if I don't bind, I'll absolutely be seen as a girl 100% of the time. I'm still unsure if I want top surgery, but I can't afford it at this time. I definitely still want to start testosterone, though.

I know I'm a mess, but can anyone help me out with some advice? Thanks!"
pusherofbuttons,asktransgender,What order to change legal informotion?,"(Currently in Oregon, born in California)

So I'm finally at a place where I can change my legal name and gender marker, but I need to know some specifics.  
  
I know the process for changing my legal name, but I'm not sure what the process is for changing my gender marker. I have a referral from a psychologist giving their 'okay' to change my legal gender, but I don't know what I need to do it.  
  
What order should I make these changes in? Assuming I can, should I try to change both my name and my gender marker at the same time?  
  
How can I get my birth certificate and high school diploma amended? I've also read something about sealing the birth certificate so no one can see that my name and gender was amended? How do I go about that/does California allow that?  
  
Given that I live in a different state than the one I was born in, does that change anything regarding what needs to be done to change my name, gender marker (on ID/drivers license), birth certificate, or anything else I may have missed?  
  
Thank you for your help; I want to do the best job I can to make sure that this process goes over as smoothly as possible."

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,My friend asked me about a prom and I lost it (a.k.a dealing with lost time and teen love drama),"As in title, my friend asked me if I would like to have my prom. As you can guess, I didn't have it as I failed the high school. Dysphoria were killing me, so I couldn't get good grades and finally they removed me from a student list.

In a first year though I met someone. We quickly became best friends, and as time passed, we were getting closer and closer to each other. Still, only friends. But eventually I started feeling ""something"" towards him, I realised in June 2016 that what I felt was love. But that'll come later.

So in the 4th year of high school, he had his prom. His parents forced him to go with some girl that he barely knew. I remember sitting at work and trying not to cry, because only if transcare in Poland weren't shit, I could be with him then. Even before I came out he knew, and I remember his jokes like ""I bet that you would look great in a wedding dress"", and when he had to go to his cousin's wedding, his father laughed that he could go with me (yeah, we're laughing about it now :D).

I didn't realised it before, but now I'm looking at all chances that I missed. Only if healthcare were better. I started HRT shortly after I turned 19 so I don't have it as bad as others do, but still, all these lost chances hurt as heck.

I eventually talked with him about it, but our conclusion was that we can't do anything about it now. However, I'm planning on getting SRS next year and he wanted to come with me. I thought ""Well, you like Japanese culture and in Thailand there's a lot of Japanese restaurants"", but I'm not sure about it either - in theory there's a chance that once I'll go back to Poland, and we'll travel together, maybe who knows what will happen. But my crush watching my recovery process would be kinda embarrassing I guess.

I don't know why I'm writing it here, but I guess that I could use some advice. Should I try, or give up? And should I travel with him, or alone?

Tl;dr: I have a crush on my best friend that I can't get over it, I see the possibility that we could be together but I'm not sure if I'm imagining things, and also I regret that Polish healthcare sucks so I couldn't start HRT earlier and now I'm looking for an advice."
bluetuba,asktransgender,how did you find out that you were trans?,"hello everyone.

um . . . for the past while now, I've been struggling a lot with my identity. 

here is a short summary: I was young, I did not like the body I was born with. I've always wished that I was born opposite sex. I grew up on hobbies and ideas that were typical of my sex. But once I hit middle school, I had acted and had hobbies that were typical of the opposite sex. I kinda pushed that thought aside until pretty recently. 

however, I currently do not strongly feel male or female. I know it sounds really contradictory, but for the past year I've identified as nonbinary, but time and time again, I've always thought my body disgusts me.

i have not talked to a doctor, since i don't have the money to do so.

so, how did you figure out that you were trans? i only know one trans person, but want to read other people's experiences too."

BouncingSpark,asktransgender,Transgender Trades people,"Hey all,

I'm new here. I've lurked for a while and finally decided to join. Reason being, I have way too many questions and I'm sick of not knowing.

So a little about me...

I came out to my mother at 17, started anti-androgens/ blockers shortly after. So sort of flip flopped and wasn't very consistent in taking them. Still, I'm glad started them when I did. I stored sperm at the fertility clinic when I was 18. I started taking Androcur and Estrace before turning 23, and started hair removal. 

Flash forward to today, I'm 26. I'm beardless, hairless, and passing as a girl. I recently came out to a whole ton of people outside of my family because being on hrt for nearly four years, being in your mid twenties and not being able to grow a beard, and basically presenting as female outside of work, it raises some questions. Trying to make excuses for looking like a girl has become too much. This a good thing because I'm finally kicking my ass into going full time. My plan is FFS later this year, just getting my affairs in order. I have my therapist sending the documents for changing my gender markers and starting speech therapy next month.

So the question I have, are there any trans girls specifically that work in trades? I'm an electrician, I started in the trade five years ago to pay for transition but realized that while it's a tough work environment, it allows me to do the things I like, it's allowed me to buy a new car, but above all else, it's going to help me pay for FFS this year...

Right now, technically still being male, I can get by at work, and just make excuses for my looks, I can hide my body under baggy clothes. However, I don't really want to be without this job post transition.  I just want to see if any of you folks can give me some insight as to what my work life might be next year after I'm living as female.

I live in Canada if that is any help!

Thanks!!!"

DeanneFlorie,asktransgender,Fitness suggestions,"Hi folks,

I'm currently a questioning AMAB. I've decided however that before I go taking up the time of doctors and counsellors who could be otherwise helping people who are sure, I wish to eliminate the possibility that I'm experiencing a form of body dysmorphia rather than gender disphoria (though I do think this is unlikely to be the case, I'd rather be certain)

Subsequently I'm looking for an exercise regimen that will help me slim down and tone up a bit in my current body, but if/when I do decide to progress into transition will not hinder any hormone-induced body changes, and ideally, things which will aid/enhance any changes I would experience when on HRT. 

Any links/guides ideally with pictures and explanation would be greatly appreciated.

I hope this is ok to post here and I've not missed an already existing guide/post. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, hope you have a great day.

bowlfPetunias,asktransgender,"I had prescription hormones, now I don't","So this a really weird situation. Nobody actually denied my hormones at all, but my doc switched from an outpatient wing of a hospital to opening her own clinic. Unfortunately, after two weeks of searching I can't find the clinic location, or her phone number and nobody at the old outpatient wing knows how to reach her. Sooo, now I've been out of hormones for a week because my prescription expired and I have no way to reach my doc. I'm kinda going crazy, I can feel my testosterone rising. I'm feeling all kinds of anxiety that I haven't felt in like 2 years, and I'm having side effects of testosterone again (*ahem* sexual and otherwise), and I don't know what to do.

I have three options that I can see. 1) DIY. I did this before, and I can do it again. Plus, this time I had a doctor watching over me, keeping my dose stable and monitoring me for 2+ years. If I stick with the same dose there's not much risk of complications. 2) See the only other doc in my city who treats trans people. I'm friends with her kid, so it's not like it would be hard to get ahold of her. Unfortunately, it would like kind of weird to switch docs after 2.5 years. Plus, what am I supposed to say about why I switched? ""So, doctor, you know how sometimes you set your keys down and then you just can't find them anymore? And it's time to leave for work, but you can't and you're scrambling and panicking and looking everywhere? That's basically what happened, but with my old doctor."" 3) Keep calling the old wing and scouring the internet and looking for my doctor before I turn into an estrogen zombie and crack open a cis woman to eat her ovaries.

Anyone every been in a similar situation before? Because I don't know what the fuck to do with myself.

edit: thanks for the reassurance that switching docs isn't that wierd, I'm going to call and make an appointment on Monday :)"

Harpoon385,asktransgender,For anyone questioning their gender,"I very frequently see people who are questioning their gender asking the same thing (not that it is bad that they ask these questions), and who get caught up in certain aspects of this.

Being transgender and scared does not mean you are cisgender. It is absolutely reasonable to be scared when you are questioning your gender and believe you are transgender, but that doesn't mean you are cisgender. Don't think you are the only trans person out there who is scared, you are not, it's very common.

Having doubts is normal. This is a big, life changing decision that does not come without risks, so of course you will be unsure if this is the right thing to do. However try not to get too caught up in the dumb excuses as to why you are not transgender. The simplest explanation is most likely the right one.

Just because you think you might not be able to pass, or only want to transition if you will pass doesn't make you cisgender. And not all transgender people do want to pass as male for female (such as non-binary people, not all, but some).

Never assume all transgender people feel a certain way, or that your narrative is 100% unique and all transgender people do not feel the way you do. So many people seem to think this, but it's not true.

You are not delusional, you are not making this all up in your head for attention, and you are not making yourself feel this way. You would know if you were doing this for attention or forcing yourself to feel this way.

You do not need to experience gender dysphoria to be transgender. Gender euphoria is a thing too. If you just feel as if you would prefer to be another gender, but being the one you were assigned at birth does not bother you, that is perfectly alright.

You can realize you are transgender at any age. It's not any less valid at any other age.

Not minding having the sex organs you were born with does not make you ""less"" trans.

Mostly sure about your gender identity is close enough.

Don't confuse sexual orientation with gender identity. And gender identity with gender presentation.

I hope this helped somebody who is currently questioning their gender. I probably missed a few things, but I didn't want it to be too long. I only mean this as a guide, I apologize if anything was inaccurate, I'm simply trying to help.

WhyCantWeHaveLongerN,asktransgender,Rushing to sperm bank?,"Hi everyone,
I'm kind of excited because after 2 years of dragging my feet out in reluctance, I finally called and set an appointment for HRT! Heck, I think I got some kind of high just from setting the appointment! :D

But I feel this might have been an impulse because I still would like to sperm bank. I don't want kids in the foreseeable future, but if somewhere down the road I change my mind, I'd still like that option to be open to me. So I guess I'm really asking:

* Is it too late to set an sperm bank appointment? My appointment with an IC clinic is on March 1, but I know there's blood tests and other things to be done first. Is there enough time between now and when I pop the first pill?

* Anyone know any good, reputable sperm banks in the SF Bay Area? Price isn't really a concern for me, it's more about how reliable they'll be since I've read horror stories of some sperm banks accidentally ""losing"" or discarding sperm samples from other people who desperately needed them, like cancer patients.

Whenever things don't feel completely right (which is pretty much every day) I get it in my head that I was all wrong and I'm actually cis and I should just try to deal with it.

If I look back on my life, I'm pretty sure I'm trans. I (afab) never really felt a connection to feminine things, and I was severely depressed until I started taking the idea of being trans seriously. I started experimenting and things just cleared up.

But when I don't 100% feel comfortable with myself even when I'm presenting as androgynous (I id as nonbinary) I get into this spiral of what if I'm not trans, what if I'm lying to myself, what if I'm going to wake up and realize that this has all been a mistake. Every morning I wake up dysphoric over my chest and when putting on a binder doesn't placate that I get paranoid.

When that happens, I start going over my life, thinking about how I was okay with ""being a girl"" when I was little, and how sometimes I can kind of feel okay with the body I have, and maybe I should just accept girlhood and move on. But that just doesn't feel right.

I just want to stop these nagging doubts. I just want to accept myself for what I am, but I can't.

Any advice?

Edit: I guess it's worth sharing that I'm currently in the closet, living with unsupportive parents (who have been fairly vocal about their views on trans people), and I've spent enough time online to probably internalize the commonly held view that nonbinary people are fake and are actually cis.

Come to think of it that might be a bigger factor than I thought.

SeanaTG,asktransgender,Electrolysis AMA with Certified Electrologists,"Hello asktransgender! 

Some of you may have heard about me through this subreddit before, I've done previous AMA's here with great success! I'm back again this year to do another, with a little extra bonus, I'm inviting along some of the professional electrologists I've had the great fortune to learn from and work with over the last some of the best in the world and I'm posting a link to this thread on hairtell.com. 

About Seana Richmond C.E. :
I began learning electrolysis when I could not afford to have my own beard removed, and after a failed attempt at laser beard removal from a commercial clinic . I began as a DIY'er, and under the advice of many of the professional electrologists at hairtell.com removed my own beard with blend. The same financial reasons that prevented me from  seeing a professional electrologist also affect many of the transpeople in the Ottawa area. I began offering low cost treatments to other transpeople from my home, about 4 or 5 years ago.Slowly that developed into a small practise.
A little over a year ago, I was invited to work with a Certified Professional Electrologist at her firm here in Ottawa, have continued to grow my clientele and complete my training at Swansons Canadian institute of Electrolysis  and became a Certified Electrologist.

Among my clientele, are CIS and transpeople alike, and at any given time I have multiple beard removals and FTM surgery prep cases ongoing.

Earlier this month, I launched my own offices here in Ottawa and my clientele have followed me to my new location in west end Ottawa. My website has been launched at http://electrolysisbyseana.com .

I've extended a personal invitation today to Mr Michael Bono, well known Certified Professional Electrologist and author of the electrolysis text ""The Blend Method"" to join me today in answering questions. Michael is a reddit virgin, so please bear with him as he adjusts to the terrain. It's also possible we may see some drop in responses from other certified electrologists from hairtell . In the meantime I would also recommend anyone with questions about permanent hair removal to join us at hairtell in the future, where every day is AMA day!
Together with my band of some of the best known electrologists worldwide I welcome you and invite you to give me the toughest questions you can come up with, about the process, expectations, pain control, electrology licensing , whatever you have!

I'll be checking in periodically to this thread , over the next couple of days and answering everything I can. We got some fantastic questions last time and I hope this time is even better!

PastPerfectTense,asktransgender,Effects of HRT (MtF) on hair loss?,"I am wondering if any Trans girls here were in the process of losing their hair via either ""pattern baldness"" or an otherwise receding hairline when they started HRT. What effect (if any) did this have on the rate of hair loss?  Did it even help reverse any effects?"
Veritaseeking,asktransgender,"Unsure of things. Need to vent, I think.","I've been mulling over this for a while now, and even now I'm not quite sure what my question is. 

I guess, I don't really understand the whole associating as a gender concept. I don't understand when people say that they feel like a guy or a girl, I just feel like a person I guess. I don't think of tasks or hobbies or wants as being traditionally feminine or masculine.  

Regardless of that, I've noticed that I hold this idea that I would have preferred to have been a woman. I don't really have a good reason when I think about it though. I don't feel like a woman trapped in a man's body or anything like that. I don't feel like my body isn't what I want it to be or doesn't fit. I just feel like being a woman would have fit me better, if that makes any sense.

At first I didn't really give the thought a second look, but considering it's persistence I've decided to, well, think about it. But, frankly, it's just led to confusion. I'm not sure I understand concepts that I thought I did know before. Is this in some way gender dysphoria? Is this just because I have clinical depression? Could those two be related?

So there's that, I'm still not sure what I want to ask, but at least I can get it off my chest."
josefiin,asktransgender,Told my parents and sister that I'm trans this weekend,"I just want to share some thoughts and feelings.

I told my sister first on the phone. It went really well. I had written a letter to both her and my parents so I was ready to tell her but hadn't planned to exactly then. I was telling her about a couple of new friends, one is genderqueer, the other agender and my sister put the pieces together and asked me straight out how I identified. So it was really easy and spontaneous, and her reaction was great. She sounded genuinely happy and excited for me. She said she had sort of known there was something about me but hadn't known what. 

We talked about hairstyles (she's a hairdresser) and makeup. When I told her my name she said that it was so weird because she had had that name in her head all week. I thought that was lovely because it shows she is giving it importance and connecting to it. She really made me feel like I could open up to her without freaking her out. I was super happy afterwards and woke up happy the next day. We talked about her coming out to visit me (I live in a different country) and while I think it is scary I am also happy about it. 

I sent my parents the letter first then we talked on the phone. It didn't go baaddly, I've read much worse here, but I don't know, I felt pretty flat afterwards. They had a lot of questions, how long I had felt this way. Kinda focused on how hard this must be for me. It's obviously difficult for them. They also talked about coming to visit me and I feel like I don't want to see them yet. I think even though I have told them it is still difficult for me to show them me. I pretty much fall into the pattern of being who they expect me to be. Even talking on the phone, I hear how I sound and I don't like it. 

I've been coming out as trans bit for bit. For context I am 36 pre-HRT. I doubt I will be able to start HRT until the beginning of ~~2017~~2018, unfortunately. I have been trying out socially transitioning on a small scale. It's gotten to the point where it has started to feel weird being called by my old name. Now I have told my family I have decided I am ready to go the whole way and be open with everybody. So I changed my name on fb and told the last of my friends in this country who didn't already know. There's still a whole bunch of people who don't know but I have stopped controlling how it spreads and will be open from now on.

I spoke to my mum on the phone this morning. She was crying. She said it was difficult because it was so sudden. Talked about mourning the old me and was concerned about my fb being public. So yeah, I think she's scared and hasn't really accepted it yet. She did keep stopping herself though like she recognised that what she was saying was not quite right, and she reiterated that she wasn't rejecting me and supports me. I think she is scared of fucking things up as much as she is of me being trans.

I didn't really know what to say so I told her that it will take time and that it's ok, and that I am still basically the same person.

Not really a question, I wanted to share and hear other people's thoughts. 
"
blakeol,asktransgender,How should I come out?,"After months and months of daily trying to figure out what my gender is I've come to the realization that I am a boy.
And although I am still processing it and accepting myself I would like to start making changes in my life, and that means tell my parents about how I feel and that I would like to do things such as going to a therapist or getting hormones.
I've already told my closest friends about this, and it feels amazing to finally get called the pronouns that feel right, I want everyone to address me like that.
I really don'r know how to tell them because I'm a very anxious guy so sitting them down and talking to them might lead to a freaking heart attack, writing a letter seems plausible but I would still have to talk to them a lot to explain better and answer questions.
I'm afraid they might not take me seriously, they will think its just a phase, and that would really take a toll on me since I'm still coming to terms with the whole thing and that these feelings are here to stay.
Any advise?
I still live with them, we also don't have the best relationship (at least from my POV)."
bookishcrow,asktransgender,I feel like a male who is trying to be a female; but I was born biologically female. Le Help?,"So I will start this out with, for the longest time I have considered myself gender fluid. Some days I feel very manly, I wear a binder and I very naturally go into feeling male. I say naturally, because, I have a VERY androgynous, leaning towards masculine appearance. I have almost male levels of testosterone despite being biologically female, I have to shave everyday, I have a very deep voice, broad shoulders, a barrel chest, and no hips, at all, my chest is wider than my hips are. On days that I am feeling like a guy, it is incredibly easy for me to pass as a guy. 

I have a harder time passing as female...and I am biologically supposed to be female. On days that I feel female, I have to try REALLY hard. I shave everywhere--which is like shaving a werewolf; I have to create the illusion of curves; and I ""put my face on"" which is just my way of saying I have to contour the shit outta my face before I start to look like a girl. It takes me hours to be able to step outside and be recognized as a woman and I often find that I need to be wearing heavily feminized clothing or I get funny looks when going into bathrooms. 

I have literally broken down into tears before because I have had women yell at me in locker rooms or bathrooms...because I was believed to be a guy. 

I've spent a lot of time talking to doctors (because I have a genetic disorder) but none of them have ever had any answers, nor really cared about my concerns. 

From a personal identity standpoint? Am I wrong for being confused about how the frack to feel? On my female days...I feel like such shit, because I never feel like I achieve being female...despite supposedly being born female. 

Has anyone ever experienced this before or have any advice?"
memae,asktransgender,Will SRS fix my premature ejaculation?,"Hello,

thats a bit of an embarrassing question but I really have a problem with premature ejaculation although I take cypro as an AA for 8 months already. A lot of people say they can barely get hard and need way longer to get off but it hasn't changed for me. Until now it didn't really bother me because I don't use my thing anyway but I am worried that I'll still cum way too quick after SRS.

Did anyone have the same problem pre SRS and can tell me how or if it has changed?"
Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Mayor becomes first official in US to come out as trans in office.,"Her name is Jess Herbst, and she's mayor of New Hope, Texas. She came out yesterday in a [letter to the citizens of her town](http://newhopetx.gov/important-message-from-the-mayor).

Her blog is here: http://jessherbst.com/"

Whoknowswhattod,asktransgender,What should I do? (talks about watching porn so NSFW just in case),"So, this will be long and winded and may not be ordered correctly, but I've had this in my mind for a long time, so here goes.

I am a happy, male, probably bi but not sure (never been with a guy and honestly don't want to as a guy, but the thought appeals to me if I were a girl, idk, it's weird), 19 year old. Been a male all my life but now that I think about it, a lot of parts of my childhood and how I feel today just don't seem quite right and I was wondering if you guys could let me know if you had/have similar situations to mine.

My childhood up to 11 was pretty straightforward. I was a giddy young boy who always did the ""boy"" thing to do, like play with cars. All that changed around 12 which was when I randomly had a strange urge to try on girl clothes. With the limited resources I had as a 12 year old I opted to try on my mom's pantyhose, and god did they feel fantastic, I loved how they felt on my legs and how they made me look. For about 2 years after that I crossdressed using my mom's clothing completely in secret and I loved every second of this and I wished that it would've been acceptable to go out like I was dressing, because I felt fantastic.

After that ""phase"" ended, (really it just got too dangerous) I went back to my normal, boring boy life, except a couple things changed.

I'm a big videogamer, and I always try to play the female in any games that offer the choice, it just felt better somehow, maybe exploring a fantasy or hidden hope I had? I don't know but I did it and it was fine. It wasn't just a sexual ""I like how sexy the character"" is thing either. One of my most vivid memories was of my cousin giving me crap for picking Daisy in Mario Kart. I really wanted to play her but he was like ""but you're a guy"". I knew this in my head but I really wanted to play her so I did anyways. Spite? Something else? Who knows but I'll throw it in here.

I had a relationship in the middle of high school with a female and it went fine, we broke up but not for any reason concerning this post. However I did always end up dreaming about trying on her clothes and getting all dressed up with her, but things went south before I could do anything about the feelings.

Fast forward to college and I've had a long time to think, not stressed as much about college apps and band and stuff, time to really think and contemplate my future. Today I really want to be a girl. Nothing in the world would make me happier than to wake up as a girl, with a wardrobe and makeup and everything else tied to being a girl, with nobody ever remembering that a guy version of me ever existed. That thought puts me in ecstasy, but I'm really not sure what to do here. I feel I could be happy enough as a guy the rest of my life, conforming to all the expectations around me and then marking all of these occurrences to some phase thing. But then I think about waking up as a girl, putting on a cute sundress and makeup, ready to take on the world, and then my mood goes through the roof! Ever since I can remember I've wanted to wake up as a girl, since day one of crossdressing.

There's also a sexual/porn related side to things as well. Right around the time I was crossdressing is when I discovered porn. At first, my favorites were women masturbating and lesbian stuff, with my reasoning being that ""hey, if I only like girls then why would I watch it?"". Then later on I transitioned to straight sex and ""shemale"" porn (I'm sorry guys that's the name of the category on the site I used). After that I discovered something that is also contentious in this slew of feelings, and that was the ""sissy"" and ""sissy hypno"" subcategory of porn. These videos, designed to change men to women through porn and other imagery became an instant favorite of mine. I watched it almost every time I masturbated for a long while. To this day in fact I put it on every now and again. I'm fairly convinced there's no ""hypnosis"" actually occurring from these videos and I haven't leaned closer or farther away from wanting to be a girl through the use of these videos.

I'm kind of scared now that I'm writing all this down. I realize I'm 19 and that my choices now affect me for the rest of my life. I just want to know if anyone else on this sub has felt like me in the past so I can know where these feelings come from.

One other thing that I forgot is that I currently have some boyshorts and women's jeggings coming through the mail. I figured I could get away with it without too many questions (it's more comfortable, etc.). Seems like a small way to see if I'm right or wrong or whatever about all this, once again I don't know.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post, and I appreciate any feedback. :)"
ash886,asktransgender,"Have my first therapy session next week, what do I do?","I have my first therapy session next week, with a psychologist. She works with the trans-friendly clinic I go to and has experience with gender issues, though it's one of many things she provides therapy for. I'm told it will most likely take 4-6 sessions before a diagnosis would be reached.

Any advice for what to say? I'm hoping I don't run into any gatekeeping and I want to get the diagnosis so I can start HRT as soon as possible."
tamay0,asktransgender,Do we need another name for trans people who need medical transitions?,"From what I read from Glaad, and a couple of other major websites that try to define what transgender is, the definition of transgender is an umbrella term.  And transsexual is considered a term for those who need medical care for the physical aspects of transition.  And while I'm fine with transgender being an umbrella term, I can't help but feel like I don't really have a good term to define that I need medical attention/my brain does not correctly ""map"" to my body.  While I could use the word transsexual, it has connotations of being a sexuality, which isn't what people with physical dysphoria are trying to describe at all. Do we need a new term for transsexual? It might seem trivial to those fall in other parts of the trans umbrella, but I feel like I can't really have a succinct argument about why I am trans when someone else is trying to make an argument about why they are trans, and we don't have overlapping definitions. I'm not trying to say being transgender only implies having physical dysphoria, just than I feel like I lack agency with the term transsexual."
TheEvoDeviant,asktransgender,How do you handle a difficult coworker while transitioning?,"I work and sales and have to dress in a suit for work, I didnt really have to many issues with coworkers at first but recently this one coworker keeps saying ""Your technically male"" and ""if your dating a woman that's considered straight."" aswell as trying to make it a daily job to bring up my birth gender, its a very lax atmosphere at work so my manager has been useless and the coworker is nonstop harassing me even though I have tried to talked to him many times over again. What do I even do in a situation like this. (Its a kiosk)"
confusedworriedtrans,asktransgender,Concerned over balding,"Hi everyone, I had these feelings of being female since I was 21, but my doctor can't help me with how I feel...
I've noticed, after my sister took a pic, that my crown is thinning slightly and worrying over balding is causing me a lot of upset and worry...
I'd hate to have my hair thinning if I do go ahead with seeing a specialist.
Is this a normal worry?
Since my dad really upset me earlier with yet another transphobic comment from him, I don't think I'll be discussing anything with a doctor..."
Dcfan7738,asktransgender,Ecitalopram(lexapro) and dysphoria,"I've been on Lexapro for about a year and a half.  At the time I had a lot if work stress and could barely focus. This helped me greatly as I could focus and stress didn't get to me anymore.  A few months later I accepted I was trans after years of repressing.

Back to the present, unfortunately I was evicted due to no longer being able to afford rent and had to quickly move.  My medicine got packed by mistake and went a week without it.  But. During withdrawal dysphoria kicked my but and found myself wanting to cry. I would even have realistic dreams related to transition. Just to nite I'm not on her yet or any other medicines.

I found my medicine yesterday and took it and no realistic dreams and the intenew feelings are gone.  

Has anyone been on lexapro and experience this?

I'm wondering if it helped me realizing I'm trans but now I'm wondering if its blocking dysphoria and if not what feelings are real."
nomorerunning97,asktransgender,Is it possible I ruined my personality?,"So I became miserable at the start of puberty. Pretty standard lol. I dealt with my trans feeling by diving into being a guy and repressing anything feminine. And now that I'm transitioning I feel like the walls are still coming down a year after coming out. 

I'm a cynical sarcastic piece of shit. That's not the person I want to be though. I feel like repressing my feminine side during my formative years may have permanently ruined my personality. I have no idea how to get it back. "
lnd940,asktransgender,Tried MTF HRT and I don't think it was for me,"Tried MTF HRT and I don't think it was for me. Was on low dose estrogen for about 6 months.

That being said, I felt it was VERY IMPORTANT for me to try HRT to understand all this. I might also change my mind in future.

Was wondering if there are others here. I love the trans community and will follow it for as long as I live, but I don't think being trans is for me.

Several reasons:

1) Mentally, I didn't feel sharp. Not sure, maybe because I was DYI'ing.

2) I am just not a fan of pills or medications in general, I don't like anything foreign or synthetic in my body. 

3) I have other interests in life that keep me occupied - business, politics

4) I just didn't feel like it was all worth all the effort and time ... i just don't care about being a woman much anymore

njshfbaewfyssz,asktransgender,[UK] Getting spiro safely without a prescription/dealing with treatment being denied for budgetary reasons,"My girlfriend has been on E for 6 or 7 years. For some reason when her bloods were done at charing cross before she started HRT her T levels were within normal female range so she was never prescribed an antiandrogen. However, for over a year now her T has been in male range, she was re-referred to charing cross because her GP refused to deal with it without their advice. Dr Seal said she did in fact need an antiandrogen and that she would be considered for one at her next GIC appointment. For some reason she was given a second appointment 11 months after the first one so we saved up for her to see Dr Lorimer through GenderCare. He wrote a recommendation for her to get a GnRH analogue and spiro alongside it for the first 14 days after the initial injection. During the appointment he said that if they refused to prescribe the GnRH analogue they should just prescribe spiro until she's seen at charing cross. She had a GP appointment earlier today and while the GP was supportive of her getting a GnRH analogue whomever deals with the budget said she couldn't get it. The GP spent most of the day trying to change their minds or to get them to approve spiro between now and August but they said they won't unless Dr. Lorimer writes another recommendation.

My understanding is that Dr. Lorimer said that he would prefer she's put on the GnRH analogue instead of spiro and that's why he didn't just recommend she was given spiro, so does anyone have any advice on how to get them to change their minds? I recommended she email PALS but she's unwilling since apparently for her practice it would be virgincare. She also seems to be at a point where she's not willing to deal with the month or so wait it would be if Dr. Lorimer were to make a new recommendation and I know she's looking into just sourcing the medicine herself. While I know that's not a great idea I know I can't change her mind about it once she's already decided to do so, so I was wondering if anyone knows of any places where she could safely source it.
"
CailanJade,asktransgender,"How common is it for one spouse to come out, and during therapy the other spouse realizes she is trans too?","I have decided it was probably my mixed gender signals that attracted my MtF husband to me in the first place, and I was wondering how common this is.

We've agreed to stick with our original pronouns, at least with each other, so no, I am not misgendering him.

My husband of almost 29 years came out to me 18 years ago, then went back in the closet because of my very negative reaction. Recently he came out again as ready for the first step in transition, and while I was just as upset this time I was prepared to go into therapy with him to try to stay together.

After a few weeks of open and frank discussion, I realized I'm bi-gender and always have been. I always knew there was something masculine in me that I desperately felt didn't belong,  because I like being female. I didn't know about non-binary, and because I didn't want to reject my femaleness I ruled out trans as a possibility. Even possibly an insult. Once I figured out that I am part female, part male, and researched dual-gender/bi-gender and found out I wasn't alone, I felt so much better. I never realized how bad I felt in the first place! I had no idea that lifelong feeling of discomfort with my body and wrongness with everything I did as a woman was gender dysphoria.

My physical presentation is 95% female, my social presentation is 90% testosterone alpha male (according to my husband and adult children). I always knew I confused people, but now I understand why.

Now we're going though this together, though it's seriously complicated because many of my needs are directly opposing his, and vice-versa."
rubyfucker69,asktransgender,[22/FTM] Will T negatively affect my fertility?,"Hey so basically, I want to have my own children some day, it's something that has always been important to me whether I carry it myself or not. I wanted to know if any of you guys know the chances of taking T will hurt my fertility in the future? I know there was a FTM guy in the news some years ago who had carried a child to term while he was pretty far along with his transition (I saw him on the Tyra Banks show back when that was a thing), but I don't know the details on how his pregnancy affected his body as well as if he stopped taking T while he was pregnant amongst other things.

TL;DR will taking T negatively affect my fertility? and seeking advice/stories from other transmen who have had children while/after transitioning"

lecrazyunt,asktransgender,how many of you smoke weed regularly to get through transition?,"Hi,

Just curious how many of us (trans) people smoke weed regularly to get through dysphoria, depression, anxiety, whatever tbh? 

I smoke every night so I can fall asleep. Been thinking about taking a break or quitting. "
H41KU,asktransgender,How can I ease dysphoria at school stemming from the wrong uniform?,"So as of now I'm on DIY HRT because I couldn't wait. I've not gotten a job at where I work so I'm applying to other places. This will hopefully be divvied up in savings between facial laser, more DIY, other clothes, fun stuff, and now a new school uniform.

Since I've been on DIY I've noticed in the past 2 days I'm happier, but also much more prone to dysphoria. Most of this stemming from not getting to wear the proper uniform for myself (that is, wearing the guys uniform as opposed to the girls uniform). 

Having asked my mum, and her saying she wasn't gonna buy me it or let me wear it, I've decided to buy a uniform myself.

However, since I'm waiting on getting a job and on buying the uniform and changes to my passability (I'm fairly passable/andro in girls clothes), I want to know how I can ignore dysphoria stemming from the wrong clothes? Or at least settle it?

(I do plan on telling my mum about DIY, but only when she either notices something or when I go to the Endo. For now I'm not sure she's settled with the idea of me being transgender, even though she's known for nearly 6 months now.)"
alyraptor,asktransgender,[Humor] What's the most cis name you can think of?,Maria? Evan? Cave Johnson? Deshawn? Phyllis? What's your pick?
feelinqueer,asktransgender,Checks ups I should have before starting e-HRT?,"TL;DR at bottom.

So I am looking to start HRT (I'm MtF) hopefully as soon as my semester ends in early May. I have told my family that this is my desire and they are as I like to put it ""confrontational supportive"" aka they are supportive and will help me through it and have already helped me with several things relating to it but I can tell that they (well at least my step dad) aren't truly understanding and very regularly challenge me and my feelings about it, which I'm confident and comfortable enough with it that I'm just like ""bring it on buddy"" but still gets annoying.

After my parents calmed down about me wanting to start HRT they think that I NEED to go see both a cardiologist and an oncologist to get the ""green light"" before even talking to an HRT doctor... About 4 years ago I had a heart ablation surgery because I had Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) and one of the rarest types there is, I can't remember the name but like 0.1% of people that have SVT have my kind and so there is a higher possibility that I still may need future surgeries (although no signs of that yet which and since it has been 4 years very unlikely that I will) and ever since the surgery I have been a bit prone to having palpitations after say high caffeine intake, so this could pose a problem with HRT, so I understand me seeing a cardiologist.

But an oncologist? Really? My grandmother had breast cancer and my grandfather had prostate cancer soooo yes I suppose I will soon be a more a likely candidate for both but to schedule one just to ask if they think the risks are too higher or something even though they may not even be educated on the medication I'll be taking? Just seems really weird, seems like a complete waste of money because oncology appointments are super expensive and not necessary to just ask about risks?

So in your experiences do you think it's best to see doctors about possible issues that could be posed due to HRT especially if you have family history or personal history with some of the possible problems? Or will a good HRT doctor either refer me to someone if they think it's a risk due to past history? I am going to have to pay for everything myself (other than what insurance pays but I will still have to pay a lot) and I have already been paying solo for college and don't have very much left and it is likely because I live in Texas that my insurance (blue cross blue shield) won't pay for HRT so I need as much money as I can get. Seems just like a big waste especially with the oncologist... Also are there any check ups that you do think are necessary before seeing an HRT doctor or will the HRT doctor like I said refer me or perform the tests themselves if they think there will be any problems... Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on this? Thanks.

TL;DR: I have a past heart condition that was supposed to be completely ""cured"" by a past surgery and I have family history of prostate and breast cancer (I'm MtF) so I could be more likely to get it. My parents think I NEED to see both a cardiologist and oncologist to get the ""green light"" for HRT before I even see an HRT doctor, but I will have to pay for everything myself besides insurance and I'm already low on money, do you think this is just being unnecessary or a good idea? Also any other check ups or anything I should get before going to see an HRT doctor?"
CosmicMina,asktransgender,Cyproterone Q,"If you're taking cyproterone, does it give the same benefits as progesterone? I realise that there is a lot of debate about the effects of progesterone. I am just curious if someone wanted to go that path, if cyproterone would make it redundant because it is a synthetic progesterone.

Aglaps,asktransgender,"I don't feel like I've actually transitioned, or that I'm even trans","I'm early 20s, have been on HRT since I was in my late teens, and technically a trans woman. But, even though I have changed my name, grown out my hair,  changed my gender with the state, and present and pass full time as a woman, I don't feel as if I have ever actually transitioned. At least not from male to female. It feels like I never really was a """"man"""" in the first place, I never presented in a masculine way or identified myself as male. And honestly its kind of hard to relate to  be lot of other trans women, who have had ""male experiences"" that I just don't understand.

 Its been so easy to just let myself pretend to be cis. It feels more real than I ever felt when I was openly trans. It feels like im being more true to myself now, even though im basically pretending that a huge part of my life never happened, and lying to friends who would accept me either way."
shyember,asktransgender,[NSFW] Orientation change? More like orientation acceptance.,"Hi, all.

My wife and I sat down last week to chew through our expectations surrounding me seeing a cute trans guy over the weekend. We framed the conversation around polyamory, but at the end of the conversation, she called me out on some of my reservedness in discussing changes that'd been happening within me over the course of our marriage.

She asked me straight-up: is this it? There's nothing else you need to let me know?

I sort of collapsed. I've been dealing with (and by dealing with, I mean ignoring and hoping it will go away) my attraction to men since high school (so, like 20 years). I'd built up a lot of shame around it and tried, desperately, to convince myself that I'm actually bi. The thing is... I've been hanging out with a number of folks who treat me like the woman I know I am, and guys (trans or cis) who show interest are way, waaaay more arousing to me than girls (trans or cis) who do the same.

So.... having finally had these revelations, as well as having experienced the feelings I feel with this trans guy, I explained to her that I've been experiencing a waning attraction to women over the course of the last 10-ish years. It's not her, or her weight, or the familiarity of our relationship... it's all women, across the board. 

I came out to her as heterosexual. We decided to end our marriage that night. We haven't started the formal proceedings, and haven't told parents or anyone but very close friends yet.

I've since been romantically involved with this trans guy and the feelings I feel for them are orders of magnitude stronger than anything I've felt for any woman ever in my life. I'm done hiding it.

So today, as I think back affectionately on our previous make-out session, I'm finding myself daydreaming about being reamed in my freshly-constructed vagina by all manner of lovely men. These are thoughts I've had for decades, but that I've not allowed to linger, out of shame. The shame is still there, and it will be for a while, at least until I can learn to heal my self-hatred, but at least now there's also a little hope. That'll have to get me through the heart-wrenching process of dividing my life from my ex... 12.5 years of marriage down the tubes because I couldn't accept myself.

Honestly (shit, this post is getting long), I feel the worst for her. So many years that she thought we were building towards a stable future... The regret I feel towards lost years on both our parts is probably the thing that most fuels my tears right now.

Anyway. Happy Valentine's day.

canichangeatall,asktransgender,"How much, in average, does it cost per month to transition M2F?","I'm in my early twenties, and I live in the US. I'm curious how much it costs to transition, because that's one of the big unknowns to me. I get that it's going to be specific to each individual person, and I'm not trying to dig for any personal info. I'm genuinely curious to know how expensive it is.

Thanks for your time!"
theSIGINT,asktransgender,Changing Jobs - Providing References?,"Sorry if this has been asked before.

Not sure how much this applies outside the software industry (backend webdev here), but whenever I'm applying for a job, it's standard practice to provide the names of three people I've worked with in the past, to serve as references.

This hasn't been a problem before, but it's a goal of mine to come out at work this year, and I'm worried that it'll make it difficult to move around without outing myself to the new office during the interview process.


If I provide a reference from a place I worked at as a man, I get outed up-front.

If I ask people I worked with as a man to use my new identity when speaking with the potential employer, and act like I'd always been that way, that...might be illegal? IANAL, but it seems fishy.

If I only provide references that know me by my new identity, there's no way I'd have enough. Assuming I come out at the place I'm working at now, which I'm not sure I want to do, I'd have...MAYBE one good reference, assuming he stays on my side. It would be like trying to get a job right out of college.

If I don't provide references at all, or not enough references, that by itself ends up being a huge red flag for someone who's been in the industry as long as I have.


Just...don't really know how to handle this. Software industry is so big on networking (no pun intended) that I'm really worried about the damage of an identity change on my career, and that's on top of all the regular worries of just trying to find/keep a job while trans.

Is there a way to strike a balance, between leaving my old life behind, and preserving my career progress/contacts?

Do I need to work a few years openly trans, and build up a second base of contacts and job history, before my new identity can become standalone?

Thanks."

Clarine87,asktransgender,"If I want my natural T to rise, do I have to stop E2 or can I merely reduce it?","I feel awful. I'm getting brainfog (headaches), hot flashes, general aches and muscle decline but I don't feel as though I want to take the ""more E2"" route to fixing it and rather I want to backpeddle my T up to 6-8nmol/L from the female range. 

Is the best course of action to taper off the E2 or cut it completely? For now I'm cutting the dose by 50% to 0.5mg every 12 hours. I understand that if I take the wrong course I'm either facing an indefinite worsening (if reducing doesnt fix T production), vs feeling really bad for a short while (if I stop E2 all together).

I'm not doubting my transness but I just felt really good when my levels were what they were at 30 days ago and if 1.1nmol/L of T = me really horny I can't imagine increasing my E2 dose would reduce that effect.

I just loved the Asexual version of myself, they were perfect!"

My journey started with ""I know I am a girl,"" and the way I'll get there is through my own process of being an awesome trans girl. It's not the way I envisioned it at the beginning, but it's just as chocolatey and delic-wait I lost the analogy.

MonePie,asktransgender,"Stopping HRT, Sperm Banking, Restarting HRT","So i'm 22, and I started HRT around 9.5 months ago. At the time I was desperate to start HRT. I told myself ""I dont even want kids, and it's OK, i can just adopt if i change my mind"" when it came time to decide to start HRT or take some more time and bank sperm. 

Its now at the stage where the thoughts of not being able to have genetic children is kind of getting me down. Not banking sperm has been a huge regret. So i have decided to stop HRT now to try my hand at banking. I dont know if its too late (haven't been able to ejaculate since week 3 HRT), whether or not I will be able to even after a good few months off HRT, but i feel if i dont at least try now, it will just become another regret. 

Obviously when it came time to making this decision, i tried to do as much research as possible, reading as many posts about experiences people had doing exactly this, and found a huge lack of any real info. I wanted to know the effects of stopping HRT, how much of my progress really would be lost, how long it would take to get viable sperm back, if im even able to and what would be experiences with changes after restarting HRT. I found some info, and some redditors have been extremely kind to share their experiences over PM, but I feel a thread that has someone document their exact experience (i know, YMMV, but still), that people could come across in months or years to come and have a detailed answer to all of the questions they might have would be very useful to the community.

So! This is why im making this. I dont plan on making multiple posts, just updating this one over the coming months to keep all the info in one spot (so if you are interested in this info, hit save). And if you are reading this and you have any questions, whether this be years old by time you come across it, feel free to PM me, ill help you out with what i know.

Update 17/02/17: So i stopped my anti androgen (cypro) and estrogen (progynova) yesterday. So far, no effects, I was expecting at least some hot flushes. I plan on seeing my GP in the next week or so, asking his advice and seeing if he could give me Clomid (will boost T production to speed this process) as suggested by a kind redditor whose been through this already.


Update 4/03/17: Ejaculation has returned. Not much comes out but its a start. My boobs and face haven't changed at all in the absence of E. Mentally things are starting to go back pretty quickly unfortunately, im not as emotional as when on E. Oh and testicle size has increased substantially. Thought that would have taken way longer."

zxcv_throwaway,asktransgender,How to calm dysphoria when there's a massive mental block for me to see myself as a girl? (Tw I guess),"Alright so I'm fairly sure I'm trans. Looking back through high school and college I've had depression for very weird reasons. Intense and painful envy of straight relationships. Being so sad and terrified of growing up and not knowing why. Feeling more and more isolated for no reason. Getting depressed at seeing straight couples meet up in college, fall in love, and start a family...it hurts so so so much. But my face isn't attractive. It's big and oblong. Maybe I'd be ok with HRT eventually, but telling me that I'll be ok in that department just doesn't help. 

I'm panicking all the time now. It's intense and I can't calm it. I have a few friends who I've told and are very supportive, but they can't hang out right now. Two of them also are leaving the area in a year because they're graduating college and I'm not finished yet. They're close friends. My best friend is very skeptical of me being trans and isn't nearly as supportive. I don't have any other good friends or people who I think would be able to comfort me. My parents would come to terms with me eventually but my grandma lives with us and there's absolutely no way she'd be ok with it.

A lot of people say that dressing up, using makeup, or making female game avatars really helps, but I think about how I'd feel doing those things and they don't sound like they'd help at all. I also have doubts because I look at older women, especially ones with bigger heads and ugly faces like mine, and it hurts and I don't know why. I don't think I'd like how I look as a girl or maybe it's that I am so far from seeing myself as a girl that nothing will satiate this pain. I'm in this hyper-distressed state right now and it's been happening more and more lately and I just need help. I feel so scared and I can't handle it. I didn't sign up for this bullshit. "

He asked even asked me if I had a name,  and that I can let him know when Im using it.  

He can't actually help me get started with transition,  but he gave me advice on what major cities may have clinics in our state and he said he`d write me any referrals. 

He said that this is a hard path, but that he thinks I`m a strong enough Person to handle it.  

I'm gonna have a talk with my dad again and Im gonna tell him what my doctor said. And this doctor offered to have an appointment where he talked to my dad to help him understand things better.

AshaWolf,asktransgender,"Well done, you lot!","Apologies for not being a question entirely. I've been musing on a couple of things and from what I've seen of the community here, I think everyone should be applauded.

Considering how difficult it can be to be accepted as who we are, or be considered equal to other women/men, or included in feminism (MtF), or fund our massive life changes, and remain sane about it all at once, coupled with the temptations to do morally ambiguous things to fund those changes or keep our history secret about who we are to a potential SO because we don't feel it relevant to who are *now*, or any number of other things....the overall consensus is to resist all these things which might make our lives easier (if stealth for example), to stand up and fight for who we are even if it means public anger.

Throw in diligently answering questions of the confused to help those in need, when you would probably prefer to forget about that aspect that you've already put it to bed, and I am honestly astounded by the dedication, humility, and downright **spine** everyone here has.

Stay up for 3 hours deciding where to jump. Give up lay on the roof and listen to music. Text roommate. Get off roof. Go home. Go to bed. 

Tuesday. Shittier day. Wake up with no will to live. Go to work. Attempt work this time. Anxiety grabs me by the throat. I choke. Go to HR. Explain situation and vent. Cry. HR sends me to hospital because I explained Mondays events. Get put in suicide watch. Talk to crisis therapist. Get let out. Go home. Spill my heart out to my roommate. Cry. A lot. Give up on life for good. Leave house. Listen to music until I get all the way to the industrial side of town. Climb 17 story grain mill. Roommate calls 911 while I'm up there. Didn't let roommate know where I was. Text ex girlfriend. Let her know how much I love her. She says she can't be with me anymore because I'm transitioning to female. Tell her I will stop transition to be with her again. That I love her. That nothing else is above her. It's been 8 months since we broke up. Still haven't got over it. She gives me hope we can be together again. I climb down. Ecstatic. I run home. Avoiding roads. Phone died on grain mill. Get home. Roommate calls police. I go to hospital on suicide watch again. Waiting in room. 

Wednesday. I'm still waiting. Talk to therapist. I'm going to psychiatric hospital now. No getting out of it. Im upset. I want to die now for good. I try to sleep. Can't. Shit bed. I get a ride to hospital. I go in. They set me up. I try to sleep all day. Talk to therapist, counselor, nurses. I want to see doctor. No doctor in day 1. Roomate and family visits. I want out. I try to sleep after they leave. Finally, I sleep that night.

Thursday. Wake up. Go see doctor. Doctor won't let me out until next day. Go back to room. Try to sleep. Go to group therapy. Finally eat for the first time in 3 days. Socialize. Start to feel better. Get in the right meds. Go to bed with Trazadone. Sleep like a lil bitch. 

Friday. Wake up, sign papers. Get pills. Go home. Go to the vape shop with roomate. Eat a lot of food. Have a good time all day. Go home again. Sleep.

Saturday. Wake up. Feel high. Meds are good. Like meds. Roomate's friend had made up breakfast. Was amazing. Get up, go get my prescriptions filled. Come home. Go to sex shop. It was meh. Go home again. Eat food. Starting to feel like shit again. Dysphoria. Hate that I broke up with ex. 

And now here we are. I want my ex back more than life itself. She meant the world to me. I question everything now. Am I even trans? Or was I just trying to find an escape from the pain?

DreamyJeanie,asktransgender,How to deal with jokes that cross the line? (Trigger Warning),"Hey everyone, sorry if this is in the wrong spot. New girl here. 

This feels much longer than it needs to be, sorry in advance and there is a TL;DR down at the bottom. 

Okay so let me start this off by saying that I would like to think I can take a joke. Working in shady factories for years has afforded me some pretty thick skin. Secondly, I understand and even enjoy gallows/shock humor. That said, let me set up the situation. 

My in-laws are super conservative, which is why I was shocked as hell when they said they were fine with me being Trans when I came out several months ago. Her mother was even supportive. Even though they live far away and we never really had the closest of relationships to begin with. 

Jump to a few days ago, my father-in-law shares a joke on Facebook where the punchline is literally killing a trans person for being trans, it was even posted with a picture of a woman falling from a bridge. I'm conflicted about posting the actual joke, because a part of me wants to know if I am just over reacting to all this, but at the same time I don't want to give this joke any more attention than it already has. So if you all want to know the content of the joke I can post a link comments.

I have not spoken to him directly. But he swears that it's not the killing of the trans woman he finds funny, it's the fact that in the joke; ""a biker dude kisses a boy he thought was a girl"". I find this very hard to believe. 

What makes matters worse, is my spouse just made up with her parents after a years long period of estrangement. I am trying to move forward with this keeping her feelings in mind as well as be careful not to completely wreck the progress she has made mending things with her parents. 

We were supposed to all Skype and deal with this but they flaked and sent a message instead. He said he is willing to talk eventually but is worried he is going to be chastised for telling a joke, then was dismissive because the 14 year old daughter of his best friend thought it was hilarious, and she is a ""down-to-earth lesbian"". 

I feel frustrated, I feel insulted, and I feel dismissed. How do you think I should move forward?

TL;DR: Father in law who was ""Totally fine"" with my transition just posted a joke to Facebook about literally killing Trans people. Tried to confront him, but he is avoiding me because he was just telling a joke. Unsure how to handle the situation while keeping my partner's feelings in consideration. "

My hair is female shaped and I just can't get over it. My ideal hairstyle is Long hair with Wispy bangs (just Google see through bangs or Korean bangs). I feel so ugly sometimes I don't want people to think that I'm a girl (an ugly girl). So I want to back-burner this until HRT really make some huge major changes and until I get my Long hair (past awkward phase, ideally boob length).

However I've just gotten 2 earlobe piercings and 1 helix piercing and they're feminine looking studs. Will this hinder me from passing as a guy? I want to go back to visiting the guy's toilet and working while presenting as a boy so I don't get anxiety or Super worried and I can concentrate on my part time job. I hate this I'm already postponing college until I can 100% pass as a Long hair girl :( 

What I'm going to do in boymode:
Hide my hair inside a SnapBack
Ditch my bra, nobody's going to notice 32A 


Things that may make me male-fail:
Small hands, feet, already gotten 32-34"" hips, 5'3 height.
Makeup (just foundation and concealer, Korean natural looking makeup style)
Using a pink kanken bag(?)
Female-passing voice (could try to talk in neutral boy voice)


Any advice? Would really appreciate! Do you think this is a wise choice? Anybody who is experiencing/has experienced this? 

Here's how I look currently..

purpleunicorndoll,asktransgender,I was mislead by a pre-op transgender woman,"22F who started dating a transgender woman 6 months ago. I was willing to date her because she told me she was post-op and I'm a cis lesbian. We took things very slow because her neovagina was healing and she was not comfortable with undressing herself. Fast forward: we went for dinner, ended up in the bedroom, both drunk and she undressed herself unconsciously. That's when I learned that she was still pre-op and lied to me all the time. I have nothing against transgender women but I will only date a transgender woman when she is post-op. She lied to me and mislead me. Genitals do matter and it's not fair that she calls me a transphobe for not liking her body. She should have been honest from the start and not all of a sudden popping a dick in my face. "
zauraz,asktransgender,Life is painful,"Over a year has now passed since I realized I was transgender. Its been a rough journey from certainty, doubt, insecurities, small experimentation and a lot more. I have started my journey towards transitioning and even if I have met some resistance it seems to have started going somewhere.

However all this time there have been a feeling that refuses to let go. Something I first today realized.

I feel like I am empty and lost inside. Like there is supposed to be some ""base"" to my existance or ""pillar"" that would be me. Something I could fall back on and it would support me. I don't know how to present it in any better way but it feels like I don't really have any form of ""stable"" 'me'. I am conflicted to the question of transitioning or not and it makes me feel like I can't get a grasp on my life. I am just floating through, never doing anything of significiant and 'real' value. Its like a limbo where I can't live to my full potential and I have no possibility of taking control as my life is right now. It sort of feels like I am a passenger in my own body putting up some kind of ""face"" that I present outwards and that restricts me to the things I do and never allow myself to do the things I really want but at the same time I can't really accept to see myself inside either.

At the same time I also suffer from depression. Even though I have grown kinda numb and able to cope with the pain normally, I am still always hurting and I am unable to tell anyone except my therapist and a few select individuals because it hurts too much. I can't fully let go without the pain coming and me instinctively try to suppress my emotion. (I am already seeing a therapist and waiting with transition makes me irritated for some reason). I have to go through life with the mask of pretending to be someone and a mask to cover up the internal pain I have. No one in my real surroundings see through either yet I sorta wish for someone to do it and reach out to pull ""me"" out of it but that won't happen..

I feel lost and having a hard time deciding if transition really is the right choice, still I do hate the body I have but I am not sure if making it correct would make me happier. I am also just floating along in this body which to me also is just another mask. I could not care less about this body and quite frankly I am apathetic towards it. Its just a chunk of walking flesh keeping me alive...


-----------

Kind of a vent. I am looking for any ideas on how to cope with a life that is gradually becoming harder and harder to maintain.. Honestly. I am lost.

The_Oen,asktransgender,How do you cope with having to wait to transition?,"I am one of the *many* people who are forced to delay transitioning, and its almost literally killing me.

comingoutthrowaway4,asktransgender,Should I come out?,"Hi I know this question is one that gets asked often but I have come to the point where I need to ask it myself.

I have not seen my parents in 6 months and within that time have started hormones and present full time at work and everywhere else. But now I am about two weeks out from seeing them in person and don't know what to do, suck it out and pretend to be a guy or come out and go in girlmode.

I honestly have no earthly idea how my parents will react, my father told me after a fight when I dropped out of college and planned to move outthat I would always have a home and that even if he is disappointed he will always love me. I have no idea how he would take to me being trans at all, it's an honest 50/50.

My main thing is that I don't know if I should come out now or wait until I'm back from visiting them. I'm afraid of what could come if things are taken badly since im staying with them and they bought my plane tickets, any advice is appreciated."
dariof25,asktransgender,[no question] Sharing a nice experience. Don't really know where else to post.,"I'm still pretty closeted: not even my closest friends know, but I do hope they suspect. You see, I don't really know how to bring it up to them, so I try to progressively be more obvious and hope they finally say something about it.

As part of those efforts, I am currently getting laser to remove my facial hair. Well, tonight was my third session and I must have been doing something well because my technician just asked me about it. I was so happy to finally talk openly about it with another human being that I started to tear up. We ended up chatting for a bit and she encouraged me to keep going with my transition.

That experience helped me to accept myself a little more and motivated me finally contact my local LBGTQ support group. I am not going to lie; I still have some doubts, but every step I take seems to confirm my feelings and brings me that much closer to happiness."
lolliegagging2,asktransgender,Cousin transitioning - advice?,"We found out over the summer of 2016 that my 16-year-old male cousin is transitioning to female (please don't think I'm being rude by saying ""he"" - he is letting us all know when it is time to refer to him as a female, should be soon). He started the hormone blocker and estrogen and wears women's clothing and is growing his hair out. Everyone in the family has been so supportive and his parents have been absolutely amazing. Last night, he asked his older sister how to get a boyfriend. She basically told him to be patient, wait for someone who likes you for who you are and don't try to be someone else. Great advice. I have no idea what he is going to go through but I imagine it is not going to be easy and that breaks my heart for him. I have been doing my own research and trying to find info for his parents that might be helpful. I found them support groups that they actually attended. What else can I suggest? He is not really on social media at all, but are there online groups he can join to talk to people who can relate?

Also, just because I don't know - and I don't mean for anyone to take this the wrong way - how DO you find someone who is accepting of you? I am not sure if he plans to have surgery down the road, but how do you have that conversation with a potential love interest? I am truly asking to get more knowledge and to possibly help him and my family understand more. 

Thank you all so much for any insight you can give."

slip-into-insanity,asktransgender,Help! (teenage transgender coming out),"So, about a year ago I first noticed the femininity in my reflection. Since then my private life has consisted of many hours researching transgenders, taking online transgender tests, crossdressing when home alone, shaving my body and so on. All my research and experiments lead to the same result... I'm now certain I'm transgender.

But... my mom found out about my shaving, and has forbidden me from doing it again. The hair is far too uncomfortable to endure, I'm only comfortable and confident with smooth feminine skin which I hide within my long sleeved shirts. In summary... the dreaded time has come... I'm going to confess.

But I'm petrified! I know she deserves to know, but I cannot fathom her response. So... please, can anyone give me some advice? Or at least share your coming out story? I'm in desperate need of a confident boost &gt;///&lt;

Obviously I managed to do that because I have an incredible amount of privilege, (working hard to try to give back to the trans community) but to all of you out there who face challenges that seem insurmountable, know that there are places and people in the world who will help you and support you, even if those around you do not."

LAAWInDoubt,asktransgender,"Did anyone else on here start living as the opposite gender when they were not sure if they were transgender, if they were dysphoric or anything like that?","Basically, I started living as a woman and I'm pre HRT currently and I can't really make up my mind if it was an impulse or if it is something I wanted to do or something that needed to do, or even something I did, and now I think ""oh well, I've started now so it'd be embarrassing if I went back and people would ask questions"" (I do think this).

I mean, I'm not sure I'm dysphoric or anything. I don't even think if I started dressing as a woman part time before I went full time as a woman that I would've ever even thought or wanted to live full time as a woman if that makes sense.

Please tell me what you think this sounds like. I like women's clothes, I prefer them to men's. I prefer leggings, cami tops, dresses, shorts, skinny jeans and oversized jackets. I don't like things like bras or bralettes because I have no breasts and it'd awkward walking around in one without breasts.

I prefer the female gender role. I prefer to be the one who cooks and cleans, looks after my boyfriend (I don't have one at the moment) and stays at home.

But the thing is, I don't want to be a gay male who wears women's clothes because of the discrimination, humiliation, etc I will face. But on the other hand I think to myself ""am I just living as a woman so then I can dress, act, etc as a woman and not be questioned"".

If I figure out i am a man then i would be a gay cisgender man as this is what I can out as before I came out as transgender. But, if I'm a transgender woman, then I'm a transgender woman.

I mean, facial hair is a nuisance and I do think I might get laser hair removal but I don't know if this is dysphoria or anything.

Also, this confuses the situation even more.... about 5-7 hours ago I was like ""I can't wait to start get surgery to get bigger hips and get a body like Kim Kardashian"" but now I am like this..... I'm doubting, I'm confused about what gender I am. I'm confused about everything I named above.

Was anyone else like this? In your honest opinion, what do you honestly think this all sounds like?"
Mogatrat,asktransgender,High E Levels causing skin dryness?,"I have the feeling I might have too high of E levels -- the last time I was tested they were at 1375.8 pg/mL.

At the moment I'm on 4mg estradiol sublingual -- if I start taking it orally or only take one out of two pills, should this problem decrease?

•	If so how did you/they cope with this short and long-term?


•	Did your / their parents ever come around or has it been a total break with them to this point in time?


I'm asking this cause my therapist recommend I ask to get a gauge for what's happened to others so I can get a basis for what I may need to be prepared to expect and face when dealing with this issue in the future.

WhatUpItsYaBfrdhfls,asktransgender,(nsfw) Need help processing strange feelings.,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post. I've been feeling a lot of strange, complex emotions lately, and I think I just need to get the whole thing out there. A bit of background information, I'm a 29 year old cis(?) man, but lately I've been questioning that.

The first inkling that there was something strange going on was about a year ago, while doing some creative writing. It was some stupid self-insert kind of story, and so when other characters were talking about me, they'd use masculine pronouns. Obviously. No problem. Until I went back and reread what I'd wrote in order to revise it. When it got to the parts with the masculine pronouns, I was overcome with a sudden sense of ""No, stop, can't do it, change it, change it, change it, etc."". So I changed all instances of he/him/his to they/them/their and I felt better.

Shortly thereafter, I started feeling a weird sort of depression. Unlike my normal bouts of depression, this was accompanied with a strong feeling of unease? out-of-place-ness? It's hard to describe. The feeling would last about a week and then go away, only to come back again. And they would be accompanied by specific sets of thoughts and desires. Things like shaving my beard, going to the store and buying ribbons for my hair, painting my nails, etc. traditionally feminine things. Like a lens coming into focus, it became increasingly clear that gender was somehow involved.

Last month things came to a head when I had a low key breakdown in front of my wife. I was feeling that weird sort of feeling, and this time it was centered around my chest. And this is where the story is going to take a left turn for a moment. For as long as I can remember I've had boobs. I'm a chubby person, but even so, my body has always distributed fat oddly such that I have very pronounced breasts. In my mid teens I went so far as to see a GP about them, and he referred me to an endocrinologist, though I never followed through. All my life I've hated my breasts. They'd been nothing but a source of ridicule and I had seriously considered getting a binder for them or even *chopping them off*.

But in that moment, they were very important, beloved, an immutable part of me. The problem was that they were hairy, and that needed to stop. My wife helped me shave and when I looked at myself in the mirror I felt so much better. And that's pretty much where I am now. Slowly incorporating more of these feminine things into my life, and I've been feeling better, but I'm still so confused about everything.

This isn't some kinky fetish thing. I'm not looking in the mirror grabbing my tits and jacking off. If it was like that I'd be able to understand it, but I really don't get what's happening to me. Why should I, after 28 years, suddenly have these distressing thoughts and question my gender? Are these feelings even legitimate or are they a symptom of some more obscure thing? I don't know, but it's all weighing on my mind more and more.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I greatly appreciate any comments, advice, suggestions, you all have."
majesticGold,asktransgender,When using your female voice...,"Do you usually use your ""head"" voice or lower throat voice? I'm not sure if this is an actual thing but, I've been trying to practice and I feel like sometimes I end up generating sounds from the lower area of my throat or the area higher above near my head.

I mean I hope what I've just said makes sense. If it does, is it better to use one or the other? Or is it completely unqiue to each person?"
Peter__D,asktransgender,There is validity in my gender identity.,"Although I don't always feel completely opposed to masculinity, I consistently would rather be a woman than a man. If I could take a pill that would permanently make me a woman, I would; In a heartbeat. I know I'm different from most men. For the last two months I have been doing everything I can, being extremely busy working 30 hours a week and taking 11 credits, filling all my free time just to avoid facing my dysphoria. As soon as I have a minute to myself all the depression comes back. The realization that I will never be a woman, that I will have to give up my family and so many friends if I ever want to transition, my discomfort surrounding my flat chest and male genitalia, the suicidal thoughts, they all come back. 

Normal people do not have to deal with these feelings. I shouldn't have to either.

Do I want to be trans? Fuck no. I wish I could go back to being fine with myself, but I know I'm not a man, and I know I'm not a woman... yet. 

As fucked up as it sounds, realizing that most people do not, on a regular basis, cry themselves to sleep or face suicidal thoughts, desperately wishing to be the other gender makes me think that this may be valid. I may be valid.

I still have over a year to wait until I can financially support myself, and get some space, away from my conservative Christian parents where I can finally try HRT. I have no clue how to cope until then, but I will make it. 

Thank you. ❤️"
AshaWolf,asktransgender,"Science-y stuff, if anyone's interested.","So, I've approached a University in Yorkshire about studying my transition as it happens, and the head of psych is wanting to meet me to discuss it. The idea is, we know there are structural brain differences in trans folk from cis folk, and straight and gay etc. but so far the most intensive studies tend to have been autopsy after HRT has changed it, rather than having a baseline of the same person. So this might show something new. There's also the qualitative angle which will contribute to the not-everyone-knows-since-childhood thing etc.

Is there anything people think I should bring up at the meeting, any questions you'd like an answer to etc? Also, if anyone else is thinking about starting HRT soon, I'm sure they'd similarly be interested in your transition etc. I can ask about travel expenses if you like?

**Update:** Likely no scans due to the internal structure of the departments (also to get a scan they'd have to go through the whole funding and ethics process, and frankly my hrt arrives tomorrow and I ain't waiting more than a few days to start it). So taking lot's of qualitative and a number of quantitative measures and some hormone level monitoring, alongside neurotransmitter levels (which will be helpful). He did also mention some things were an illusion in regards to scans etc which I intend to question him on when we get down to it all.

All in all, it's gonna be a long process (I said I'd be willing to be a case study for several years if necessary, at least until all surgeries and hormones/body changes become relatively stable and psychologically settled in etc.). First battery of tests/questions on thursday and interview on monday."
gelbkatze,asktransgender,I have the option between Dr. Wittenberg and Dr. McGinn. Any opinions or suggestions on who would be better to go to for SRS,"Hey! I am currently debating on who to go with in regards to SRS. I just received a call from Dr. McGinn's office so timing would not be a problem. 

With Dr. Witttenberg I felt good about her surgical background and felt really comfortable talking to her during the consult (she is amazingly humble for a surgeon). I am just nervous by the fact that she has not done to many of these specific procedures. That being said, I have not really heard anything negative about her. 

Dr. McGinn is kind of the opposite where she has a lot more experience but I have heard some horror stories and she definitely has an ego. 

At the end of the day, I am not trying to become friends with the provider, so I guess in regards to outcomes, anyone have advice on who would be the better option?

Really appreciate any advice or help! "
viridianlion,asktransgender,Any biochemists here who can answer a rather complex estrogen enzyme polymorphism question?,"Trans doc here, I have a trans-female patient who for whatever reason, seems to have an incredibly efficient 17 beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase enzyme. Before I even get into the deets, she's on sublinual estradiol (generic equine) Even with a total estrogen over 1k, estradiol is barely 100 and estrone is 900. This is obviously too high for a total, and with a dose reduction, total is now within the normal range, but I'm a long way from saturating E2 receptors at 300. Total is now mid 500s, and of this, only 10% is estradiol. Over 90% is estrone. It seems nearly 90% of all consumed estradiol is being converted to estrone by this enzyme. 

Estrone is a shitty agonist of the receptor, and competitively binds with E2 for the spot. Beyond slowing down transition, Estrone has far more negative associations (BMD, cancer, thrombosis). 

So far, theories are Fisetin, or Cinnaminic acids, but there is very little research on direct inhibitors of this enzyme. 

Other possible option is to get estrace approved and avoid the equine estrogens and use the direct 17b and hope this is less easily converted. 

of note, the patient's T wasn't at goal with plain spiro near max, and I added finasteride in hopes of lowering further but she again had a paradoxical increase in T levels likely due to a slow aromatase enzyme. I also added topical bioidentical progesterone at the last visit which the patient hasn't started yet (they are using sublingual medroxy which was all I had available at the time to use) I've pulled the Finasteride and am ruminating on using bicalutamide, but haven't decided which chess piece to move first. 

Regardless, this E1 conversion problem existed before the finasteride or progesterone were added, I had hoped they would help with it, but they made no change whatsoever other than increasing total T. 

I welcome the input of biochemists/doctors/educated people on this, as its the first time i've run into this unique enzyme polymorphism. "

Last night we were at Destiny apartment cause she is moving in with me. Her mother comes in with Dinner and the pastor. My mouth drop to the damn floor. I was scared. I ask what is he doing here. She said to cleanse ""him"". I said this is Destiny and she is a girl!. Now if you cannot accept that leave with him. This is not a devil act upon the lord. Destiny started crying said mom why cant you just accept me. The pastor was reading from the bible and touching her forehead. I pushed him back and said get out.  Her mom and pastor left called destiny the devil.  I felt so bad. She was crying and telling me this is what she has been going through. I told her that I am here for you and whatever you need. We are girls and we will stick together. She is going to school and working. She does a lot you know. I had to stop her from several suicide attempts including last night

The confusing part. Her mother calls this morning leaving a voicemail.  ""Destiny I am sorry. I know how much this has hurt you. If you want to be a woman and you feel truly this is you. Fine. But do not get SRS. Help me understand"" Love you destiny"".

wrisun,asktransgender,Traveling as transgender?,"So, I have International Management as a minor of mine, and this requires me to spend one semester abroad. I chose the Netherlands, seeing as they are one of the more progressive LGBT places in the world.

I should be starting HRT next week on Thursday, and my trip begins in September. I am FTM, and so I assume I should be passing as male by then (as I would be 6 months on T). If I don't pass, I'm not worried because I can just go as female and rough it out for a few months abroad. 

But I'm concerned if I do pass. I mean, I WANT to pass - I really do! I want to do this trip as a male, like it should be.
But I'm concerned about crossing the borders and such. Since all of my ID is still under ""Female"" and with my old photo (with long hair) and my dead name (which is still my legal name), I'm really scared the border patrol officers won't let me pass through. I plan to carry a doctor's note confirming that I am transgender, but I'm still scared that they won't let me pass if they're transphobic or think I'm lying or whatever.

What has your experience been with traveling abroad, especially if your passport doesn't match your preferred gender/your new appearance?

Should I wait a year to transition to avoid the potential dangers? Should I postpone my trip until January so I can have time to change all of my documents? Or should I just go for it?"
Sbxbm,asktransgender,Should I see a therapist first ?,"Ok so I wanna start Hrt like asap but the thing is should I see a therapist first or should I just go with informed consent I know place where I can get that but I'm still (17) I will be turning 18 in August so I need advice on which one would be better for me. "
lostpaw,asktransgender,Quitting smoking on HRT !,"I'm 23 and have been a smoker for a while. I picked it up due to extreme abuse from my ex gf. I wouldn't be thinking much about quitting if it wasn't for my research on the ill effects of it not just on my general health but as well as my HRT and Dr.Suporn's guidelines for his patients. 

I've known for years now that he requires his patients to be non smokers but does anyone know how long you have to be a non smoker?? Or have quit smoking? Also is there any research to indicate that smoking can fuck with my HRT results? Things are a bit mixed online and I'm trying to compile the best mental case to quit finally. 

[edit]: I forgot to mention I'm MTF and have been on hormones for roughly 3 weeks now (woooooooot)"
TheWalkingSadness,asktransgender,Not really trans related. kind of. Should I get back to gaming?,"So.. I used to play games. don't want to bore you. Thesedays. I sleep at 6-7-3am. sleep for 12-13hours. wake up. daydream in bed about trans stuff for an hour. slowly crawl to bathroom, wash my face. skip launch or dinner be sad and somehow waste the time until the other day. I can never go out because it makes my dysphoria worse. It makes me hate myself even more. I hate myself so much because of my dysphoria and always think ""Gender doesn't matter"". ""There are people with bigger problems and you're whining about being insane"" blah blah blah

recently I started playing wow again. but my PC is not powerful at all... I used to do programming and it was basically what kept me alive (stopping it is what made me so miserable now that i can't start again).

do you think I should pay money for a new GPU and start playing games? I feel so pathetic that I can't even make myself go to the store and buy  a game. but I thought it would be a good start? Is this a healthy way of dealing with problems? I could also instead buy a cheaper monitor not suitable for gaming (terrible response time. like 50ms) but it could help me enjoy stuff more and maybe one day start programming. what do you think!? do you think gaming is good or bad?! for dealing with my problems. I do currently play overwatch and WoW. instead of checking this forums every 5 seconds. or watching nonsense on youtube or being sad in bed. but playing with minimum settings and 50% render scale is awful :D

Sorry sorry. it's not trans related. but you people are familiar with the way I feel. I have no other friends to talk to either

i find less and less point in living. ""why should I live?"" ""why should I even write code? what's the point"" ""what's the point of controlling imaginary characters and getting better at controlling it..."" and been becoming very robot like! I thought maybe starting gaming again and not caring would help me."
SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,Is cutting my workout but still calorie counting good for preparation for GRS?,"After my issue yesterday I'm trying to put back together the pieces of my hope and get it through my head it isn't over yet. 

I was just wondering though as I heard being too light can cause GRS complications.. is it just safer not to work out until it's had? Currently I'm 5'2 1/2, my weight bounces between 128 lbs to 136 lbs. I have a rather mid-size build so I'm not petite, per say.. but I am small.

Prior to finding out I might be able to get GRS I was doing a workout routine on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.. although Friday was more Yoga then anything else.

Also for the guys, maybe putting on more weight is an option..? Sorry I don't know much about phalloplasty but I know a lot of men don't care for it due to how iffy it is."
thrownaddict,asktransgender,Getting Sober,"Using a throwaway because I don't want this post on my main account, but anyway:

I got into (pretty much) everything at a young age. It was a wonderful way to escape my dysphoria, to cure my jealousy of girls in social situations, and to prove I had some masculinity to myself and others (by doing more of whatever I at the time than anyone else). Fast forward to me hitting rock bottom due to substances not sweeping my real issues and identity under the carpet anymore (and trying to use more to compensate for that), *but now I'm trying to get sober*.

I have about two months of sobriety, but I'm running into a few issues and I'm wondering if anybody has overcome these: 

1. 12-Step Meetings are mainly full of (at least in my area) old hetero dudes. While there are women's meetings, I'm not currently allowed to go to them (presenting as male) and I don't connect with the men's meetings at all. I've tried finding LGBTQ meetings but there's no real listing for them available (if they even exist). 

2. The general rule for sponsorship in 12-step meetings is that you pick a sponsor of your own gender. For those that don't know a sponsor is one who you open up to, work through issues that would threaten your sobriety, and in general is a guiding confidant. This rule alone sets me going down in a dysphoric spiral since I can't pick a sponsor that would match with my gender identity. Furthermore, even if I did get a woman sponsor, a lot of my issues are based around self image and anxiety over being trans and I don't think that they would understand.

Kuunkulta,asktransgender,I need a hug :( Depression triggers,"I dunno if I should call this a rant, venting, asking for advice or bit of everything. All I know is I could really use a hug right now... I can't recommend reading this to anyone, especially if you think you are already even slightly depressed. The effect of my anti-depressants has ran it's course for the day and this is unfiltered venting. Yeah I guess venting is the right word after all.

I just read the innocent topic asking about the hobbies of the people here and it made me think about my life and now I'm so depressed. I used to love playing pc games but that's become just something to pass the time between sleep. My other hobby was frisbeegolf. I just started playing last summer when I was in a group for the young and unemployed. You know, one of those things to keep us from... ugh now what do you call it English... To keep us becoming social outcasts or something. Have some directed activities for fun, exercise and to find work or new education opportunities. Frisbeegolf was one of the things we did a lot and me and couple of the guys kept playing in our free time. But you can only stay in the group for so long and for all us it ended before Christmas. One of moved pretty far but three of us all said we'd keep in touch and play again in the summer. But I never heard from them again and I don't expect to either. So I dunno if I'm gonna keep playing by myself. There's a group in my town for the sport but I just don't care for those people.

So why don't I call those guys myself? Because I'm tired of it. It's all happened so many times before I already know exactly how it's gonna work. I call, we agree to do something together and have a good time. Afterwards again I won't hear anything from them until I'm the one to call them. If I do, I get the ""yeah I've been meaning to text you but you know mumblemumblemumble"". Eventually I get tired of being the one always calling and I never see them again. That's how it's been all my life. All the friends I've ever had, exactly the same thing. So this time I said fuck it, I can't be arsed with it again, just skip to the end.

When the group ended I took a 6 week course in entrepreneurship and I met a nice guy who introduced me to his fiance and we played a lot Overwatch together. And this guy even texted me often to play with them and we did some shopping too the three of us. It was pretty nice! But now I haven't heard from them in two or three weeks and they don't return my messages. So I dunno what's up with them but I doubt I'll hear from them again. So here I am, friendless again. And none of these people ever have even known I'm trans! I just don't get what the problem is, how in hell can it be this difficult to maintain friendships?! I admit I'm a bit quiet until I warm up to people but dammit I've always had a great time with all the friends I've ever had but whenever we lose that job or school or course connection it just all falls apart. Maybe that's just how men are...

I've only had one girlfriend in my life and we were together for about 1.5 years until the little things started to get on her nerves and we ""took a little break from each other"". Why don't people just call things by their real names? It was a break up dammit. We were pretty different but I was 100% committed and made a looot of compromises for her. It wasn't easy but I wanted to make it work. I knew from the beginning it wouldn't last forever but I still expected it to last a little longer. I came out to her as trans and she pretty much betrayed my trust. I don't feel like explaining the whole thing again. Anyway it wasn't THE reason we broke up but I know it was part of it. So, until I go full time I won't date anyone again without letting them knowing from the start what's up with me. 

And that's another thing depressing me. The short time I spent in that relationship was the happiest time of my life despite our differences. I really miss all the hugging and cuddling and just feeling loved. There's nothing better in the world than that feeling. Screw money, sex, drugs and even rock'n'roll, I want cuddling! So now I have well thought out, funny and eloquent dating profiles up on two sites. And I only get attention from guys. A lot of smut but there's some decent messages there too but I just had to block men entirely on both sites. It's women I'm into but I like to be polite to everyone so blocking them was annoying. Anyway now I pretty much only get messages from guys who have their gender set to female for insincere purposes. Ugh... Well I knew that putting the word trans on my profile was a mistake but I don't want to have deal with making that revelation later. Honesty is something I really value so at least I can feel good about sticking to my principles. 

I know all too well that the best way to meet someone is to just go out and meet people. Lgbt support groups for one would be a good place to start, would get some support too. But dating in my current situation... I don't know if it's even a good idea in the first place. I like to think that I can pass for a woman physically, but as soon as I open my mouth, it's obvious I'm trans (or viewed as a crossdresser, whatever). My voice is really low and training is really difficult. I hit falsetto before my pitch is even in the androgynous range and it causes such dysphoria that it's hard for me to open my mouth even for training. The thought of going outside dressed up with makeup and all sounding like this is just too much for me. My country offers free speech therapy, tracheal shave and some voice surgery options but only with the diagnosis and it's going to be a long time before I get it because of the gatekeeping here in Finland... So I'm stuck training home with anxiety and getting nowhere. I've started to understand throat and head voices and how to make them but doing either is extremely stressful on the vocal cords and I'm afraid of losing what little range I have. I can't even scream out my frustration because I can't make that high noise! My scream is either a breathy eep or a low roar. I lost my voice entirely when I was a kid and I'm starting to wonder if that did permanent damage. 

This really just sucks so much! And the worst part? I actually feel good about my face and body. I don't worry about hrt or ffs. I can do without them, I have no problem waiting for the gatekeepers. Makeup and clothes already do wonders! But my voice destroys all the confidence I get from that. It doesn't matter how good I feel about my other qualities because I know I can never accept myself and move on with my life until my voice is passable. 

I have absolutely no plans for the future. I've never felt the pull to get into some certain field of work. I don't feel interested in anything and nothing really cheers me up. My only dream for life is to one day be able to just sit on a white beach somewhere around the equator. That's it, just sit on a beach. I have no idea what I would do or think about. Just sit there alone. That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of dreams or retirement or death. I would love to have a family and feel loved but it's hard to imagine it. I have no clue about a career and as long as I'm the prisoner of my own voice I have trouble seeing the point of even trying to imagine a better life. I actually don't even remember what it feels like to be truly happy. I know I said my time in a relationship was the happiest time in my life and I didn't lie about it. It really was, but I still wasn't happy. It's hard to explain that. I guess happiness is a wrong word entirely. That time of my life sucked the least. Yeah that sounds more like it. It was close to being happy but not quite there. When did I last have fun? I just can't tell. I may have had some fun moments over the years but the only emotion about anything I've done that I can remember is, meh. No actually there was an event about a month ago that was a little better! I was so depressed that day that I got drunk. I only ever get drunk when I feel the only other option is killing myself. After reading all this I imagine you're thinking that must be every other day, but it's only once a year on average. In general I'm not suicidal, believe it or not. Anyway I got really drunk and just cried for at least three hours straight. It did make me feel a little better. Makes me wish I could get drunk more often but my poor stomach just can't handle booze very well.. I just can't start crying without it, some mental block maybe. I've spent years learning to hide all emotion. Such a mistake. I guess if I would have known that what I felt in my youth was dysphoria I wouldn't have become so depressed. If I had known it was really possible, I would have transitioned almost a decade ago. So many lost years, so many regrets for so many things... But I still have been any happier if I had transitioned? Would I still know what work I would like? Doesn't matter. 

I keep telling everyone else to have hope but I can't convince myself to hope for much. I know I'll get the surgeries I need eventually and maybe even my voice will get better, but will any of that have any effect on my life? Will I find passion for work, love and life? Or will I end up on early retirement eating unhelpful anti-depressants for the rest of my despite finally having healthy self-image? Every now and then I read of others for whom hrt brought a whole new beginning, but I don't quite dare to hope for that. I still can't imagine myself enjoying life like a normal person... My hopes at the moment are limited to people taking the title seriously and not getting more depressed from reading this. 

Can you believe that it was my ability to make her laugh that first attracted my ex to me? I care about everyone else's happiness wellbeing more than my own. I try to make them smile and laugh and I try to give them hope. My heart breaks whenever I hear or read about anyone being treated badly, including animals. I sort of feel the same even for inanimate objects! I sometimes feel bad for the garbage I throw out for crying out loud! And I somehow feel even stronger for fictional characters! I've never shed a tear over wars or terrorist attacks or whatever but when it happens to fictional characters... I wept like a child multiple times when I read the Warcraft novel Rise of the Horde. It's a great book and I want to read it again but I just can't. It's too sad, I just can't. 

I should probably stop writing already, I'm just rambling at this point and it's like I'm writing my memoirs! I can't believe how long this text became! I'm certain many of you feel this should be posted on some mental health sub instead of here but I only feel accepted and safe posting here. I feel a bit better for writing all this and I'm trying to decide whether to press that submit button or not... I suppose I should but it's difficult to show my feelings to strangers, even online. I'm trying fix that so I guess here goes nothing. Thanks for taking your time to read this and sorry for depressing you"

Ralphe2449,asktransgender,Countries with progressive gender therapist?,"So i live in southern EU and as you can imagine you cant really expect some really progressive gender therapists around that are open to the idea of non binary people and dont brainlessly follow a book because they are scared of not being correct and getting sued at the end.

I am male, have a very slight gender confusion and a more serious genital dysphoria and i am looking to discuss this with a therapist and when they realize this is something serious get the approval letter for bottom surgery. That means someone who will be open to the idea of someone having grs but intends to keep living as a male.

But of course i cant do something like that with some random therapist who doesnt even recognize non binary people so i would like to know if anyone had experiences with good gender therapists in EU countries, probably northern EU ones since i can easily move there to be close to a therapist and discuss that issue.

I know US has quite a few in progressive states and know people who did the same thing and got the surgery in the US by being honest but moving there is way harder than moving to an EU country.

CG-02_SweetAutumn,asktransgender,How common is it to not want SRS?,"I've heard of not wanting it before, but here it seems like tons of people want it. Am I a fringe case for not wanting it?

I don't hate having a dick, heck, I'm even looking forwards to foreskin restoration being possible. If science gets there, sure, I'd have a vulva added, but as an addition, not a replacement.

Though I guess there's a possibility that primarily consuming futa porn since my sexual awakening just destroyed any notion of ""dick != girl"" in my mind."

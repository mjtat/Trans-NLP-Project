canthaveitit,asktransgender,So confused,"Lol I dont even know why im writing this, this makes no sense and its quite embarrassing. Basically im ftm and straight as a fucking plank of wood like im so into girls haha like ive known since i was 9. But every few months i dabble in one or two romantic fics like ""joshler"" or phan or some shit like that for no reason at all, other than me knowing of and admiring the famous people. Not attracted to apart from sometimes aesthetically but its not attraction at all. Also, it doesnt like make me get excited or anything lke that. You know what, i need to leave the house more. I guess im just answering this myself already, it must just be pure curiousity cause i could never imagine myself with a guy. I also watch gay porn occasionally (ok i know, thats a bit far) but like why tf do i watch it sometimes!!! I just dont understand because i just enjoy watching two ppl, no matter what gender. But im not attracted to them!! I just dont get it. I can only imagine myself in relations with women, and that would include trans women (and i seriously dont mean any offense by that at all, the reason i dont believe the label pansexual etc is because i feel that invalidates trans ppl as the gender they really are) so that is why even tho i would date a trans women i was attracted to, i dont consider myself pan or any of that. But thats just my opinion.
But anyways, any advice as to why this stuff is occuring?? Thanks :) and i know how weird i am, but ugh, this is what reddit is for right. Anonymnity."
piscina_dela_muerta,asktransgender,Can I just rant?,"I just have had a lot going on and I just dont really know how to deal with it at the moment. Life has been hard between living in a semi new place and starting a new job in the past couple months. I finally came out to my parents in the beginning of August. Lots of change.

But last week I finally had my first phone call with my parents since I came out. And it went pretty okay...until I mentioned about being pretty busy the day before. My mom got all excited and asked what I did. She was less excited when I told her I was busy getting my legal name change started. Even though I asked her not to use my deadname, she goes ""Oh [deadname]...oh. Whoops. Well...whatever."" That's a quote. Also her and my dad kept conversing about what ""he"" was saying. I was too tired to deal with correcting my pronouns for them. My mom also kept trying to guilt me with about how they pray for me everyday but it's just really hard for them sometimes. Oh god. And then I mentioned one little thing about it being hard for me (I dont remember what I mentioned exactly being hard for me) to which my mom mumbled ""It wouldnt be so hard if you'd just stay a man"" in response. I'm not cutting my family out of my life but goddamn is it hard not to sometimes.

And then my romantic life. We all know dating is fucking hard even before transition. And during transition it's fucking hell. I finally found a girl on Tinder who was really great to me. She was cute and real and she treated me like a fucking human. She didnt call me brave in the first 5 minutes. She was cool. We talked for a couple days and made a date and got really excited about it. She ends up coming to my place and we have dinner and then watch netflix for a couple hours. We cuddle and talk and this doesnt feel like a 1st date. It feels like a 15th date. I just feel so comfortable. So comfortable in fact that we start having sex. I'm still not even really sure how it started. But it was nice. Very passionate and very real. She ends up having to leave shortly after so we get dressed and clean up and I walk her out. We have an exchange of words akin to ""See you soon?"" ""Absolutely"" and then we kiss goodbye. And those are the last words we'll ever speak to each other because sometime during the night after this, she blocks me on every form of social media that we shared. I dont know what I did wrong but I just feel very very hurt and betrayed. :/"
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Possible to get a feminine voice pretty fast?,"I am 15, I have a deeper voice than you would expect from a 15 year old and would like to know if I could train my voice to be feminine in 2 1/2 months. I have a appointment with a professional that can help me with that but I'm not sure if I am able to get my voice right in this short amount of time. I heard of people that need 4-6 months."
jenna_beee,asktransgender,Does anyone know how long it takes for zoladex/goserelin acetate to work?,"So I was taking 50mg of cypro daily up until about about a month ago when I was switched to zoladex.  I'd read there was going to be a t spike for the first couple of weeks, but a month later I'm starting to get random erections again.  

Could my gp have injected it wrong? Or is there a chance it isn't working? Or is this normal? They had completely disappeared after two weeks on cypro.  I'm really worried that I'm just virilizing now and it's a waste of time"
RockTurtle998,asktransgender,Starting a LGBT club in school,My councilor requested that I get flyers to figure out how to advertise the club. If anyone has started a club and has tips that will be helpful too. Thank you.
gaijin_smash,asktransgender,I detransitioned to deal with an underlying illness. How do you find the strength to retransition?,"The tldr of my situation is that I've been seriously ill for about a decade, but every doctor has written me off until I demanded to have an ANA run. Now all signs point to me having a connective tissue disorder/lupus, so I detransitioned to prevent HRT from skewing my test results. I never transitioned socially as I don't pass at all.

I know things will be better once I get proper treatment. But I don't know if I have the strength to retransition after. HRT did nothing for me, really, just gave me a few slight changes I didn't want and none of the ones I did. Even though I want to be a guy more than anything, to be seen and treated as one and to be comfortable with my body, I don't think it's in my cards. I wouldn't want to transition socially unless I was comfortable with my own body, and without HRT that's not going to happen, and since HRT basically didn't work at all...

I'm stuck. I'm tired. I had a massive wave of dysphoria checking out at the supermarket on Friday, when there were four women in front of me, and I could just sense their judgment of the sad, fat girl who was so bad at being a girl she decided she didn't want to be one. I feel like it's easier to just give up now, since I'll never make it as a man."
leavingthematrix,asktransgender,Spironolactone too high? Or did it take a while for the E to kick in?,"So I have been on HRT since last Tuesday, and by Saturday I was feeling cold all over, super depressed and really feeling so bad that I was wondering whether or not I was making the right choice. So I skipped both spiro and estradiol yesterday. Today I started to feel the testosterone rush back, but I was in a better mood and decided to take it again. Now, I feel even better than I did before. There is a lightness in my chest, and I feel happier. I am wondering if this is because it took this long for the estradiol to start kicking in? Or am I on so much spiro that it's making my testosterone levels too low? What are y'alls experiences?"
Throwawayzztop,asktransgender,How did you find the strength to come out?,"I'm 18 and after years of questioning and wondering I have finally accepted that I am transgender, and that I would rather be a girl. This in itself was a large accomplishment for me and I feel very relieved now. 
But for the moment I'm home from college staying with my parents again. And on the very long drive home I thought a lot about what I should do, and I want to tell my parents, but I feel like I can't. I want to tell them to start my therapy and start hrt, and as far as I know I have to tell them to start all this because of insurance and money. I think they'd eventually accept it but I feel it would ruin our whole family dynamic I guess. But now that I'm home I fell back into the picture of my old self that I always put on when I'm around them, it's not what I'm really like and being like this Is making my very stressed, anxious and depressed. I'm pretty sure I'm stressed because I want to tell them, but I just can't ever imagine myself telling them, nor can I imagine myself being at family holidays as a girl, I would feel like a fool. I don't know if these feelings of distress are dysphoria but I really want to tell them to start but I am so torn about it I can't. Half of me wants to run upstairs and just blurt it out and run away. And the other half of me wants to never say it and just continue living like this. How the hell did any of you manage to come out and say it to your parents? I've already told my girlfriend and she is very supportive and I feel like it won't be bad telling my friends but my parents are my band right now. They look at me a certain way and I can't just change that whole view. "
melynda12,asktransgender,Just told the first person i'm trans,"So i had my second appointment today at the psychiatrist and the first time i was there i didn't have the guts to bring up the topic trans, i just thought about it and got sick to my stomach but today was my second meeting and i told myself all week long I HAVE TO TELL her because i'm never gonna feel or get better by just supressing my feelings, so today i told my psychiatrist i'm transgender, i was literally shaking and about to feint but she took it so well, shes the sweetest person and got really excited because i'm the first transgender person shes helping personally, and she asked alot of good questions and we talked about it for an hour. Got another meeting with her and a gender therapist in two weeks i'm actually excited now that it's out there, and i feel great. It's like a big rock left my stomach and i can breathe again, i yet have to tell my family but thats for another time, but this was a great first step!"
Muppet4H,asktransgender,Help please?,"I need help. And people to talk to. I just created this account to try and get this help and ask some questions. I need help trying to figure out whether or not I'm trans and what that means and what I should do with my life. For the record I am born gendered as male.

So about a year and a half ago I really started questioning whether or not I was trans as I was getting ready to graduate from college. I realized that I've never really been overly happy with how I look. I was just more comfortable being around girls, had very few male friends, have never wanted to participate in anything traditionally male. As a child I was far more interested in playing pretend games with girls my age than anything else. I realized I was jealous of the dresses my friends were picking out to graduate in and how they looked in them. 

Additionally I hate my body hair and facial hair and the act of shaving my face and just feel that I would be happier being a girl. 

So I decided that I was going to pursue this and hopefully transition. I told my girlfriend and she was really supportive. I wore girls' leggings and tucked for the first time and loved the way my legs looked. I started doing some extra shaving and was a little happier with my body. 

Then I decided to tell my family and it hit the fan from there. Interestingly enough when I went to tell them they guessed that I was telling them I was a gay man before I could get anything out and said they had been expecting it for a while and were perfectly ok with it. When I told them that wasn't the case They listened and smiled and said all the right things (my girlfriend was there for my support) and I felt amazing. But then the next day the first thing that mom said to me was that if I wanted this they would be providing no financial assistance with anything because ""if I really wanted this I should have to struggle for it."" Then it really just became all about them and even though they would still love me it would be a big inconvenience to their life and no one else in the family would likely speak to me anymore. She talked about how I never showed any signs as a child, which is true: I never knew when I was three like most people, I didn't try to dress in girls clothes, I never tried to cut off my penis or anything like that. I had an amazing childhood that I was satisfied with. I was high school valedictorian, everyone in the community has incredible respect for me, I graduated college with a 3.9, like I said life has been good which doesn't gel with dysphoria. At this point I was seeing a gender therapist who was supportive.

To throw another wrench in the works, I'm a music teacher. Right now I work in an elementary school. At the time of my mom dragging me down I worked at a high school. I love being a teacher. It's how I define myself above all else. So since I was feeling unloved by my parents and being told (by them) that I couldn't be trans and be a teacher, I stopped everything. I stopped seeing my therapist. I stopped growing my hair and nails. I stopped looking at female clothing. Just stopped. 

So here I am at almost 24, worried that my chance to do this and look really good is passing me by (I'm only 5'6"" and under 150 pounds so I feel like I have a decent chance of looking ok). Worried that if I do try to move forward with anything I will lose my family and my career. 

If you're still with me I appreciate it as I know this post has been long and somewhat incoherent. So like I said, I need help. Do you think I'm trans? What would you do if you were me? After reading this massive thing what do you have to say to me?

Thanks for anyone willing to help.

angelthesiren,asktransgender,Question about supporting my girlfriend,"Hey everyone! Here's what's going on: 

My girlfriend and I are both trans. I'm out to most of my friends and she's only out to me. Without the resources to transition just yet, we're both still presenting as our DGAB. 

My family isn't supportive, but I've moved states away from them and cut off all communication. For her, well, it's not that easy.

We're staying with a family friend of hers while we work on getting things together. Today, while she was at a job interview (she got the job btw! yay) I was still here with him. We'll call him Arthur (I just kinda... looked to the left and saw the sword in the stone DVD case lmao). 

We were just peacefully watching the price is right when he made some comments about one of the girls on there ""really being a guy"" and tried to figure it out by looking at her hands. I didn't say anything for hopefully obvious reasons. 

Later, a news segment came on about a former military member transitioning to female. He quickly said ""no, no, nope!"" about 15 times and changed the channel.

Arthur is very important to my girlfriend. He got her this job. She's always been his favorite. I'm worried that with his attitude, she'll change her mind about transition which worries me to my core, because she's made it clear she needs it to be truly happy and comfortable with herself. If there was ever a textbook case of severe dysphoria, she'd be it.

Should I talk to her about it? I don't know if she's considered the ramifications of transition before, especially possible disapproval and even being cut off completely. I really don't know what to do here and could use some advice."
misscharlotteG,asktransgender,My sex drive came back with a vengeance! (a good post),"So my sex drive came and went and came and went over the past year but lately it has been back and I am frequently day-dreaming about sex and wanting to do all manner of sexy things.

I actually enjoy it, it is the same kinds of feelings I have had before but now just seems different. I am a woman now so exploring my sexuality is only natural. (Should I act on these feelings, I will ensure protection is used.)

Anyone else go through this? "
ShellieHart,asktransgender,Internal Itching of the Breasts?,"HRT 6 months. It's happening again. That is this infernal itching deep inside the breasts that I am sure signifies growth. I have had pain and discomfort since starting HRT, but now I have this insane itching deep inside my breasts that cannot be scratched adequately. Does anyone else have this problem?

sithysoth,asktransgender,Crazy wide hips. Will never pass :(,"I have a really tiny waist, about 26 inches but a hip size of 36, 34 which  are bones. No matter how hard I try I just cant pass. My hip shape is too feminine..."
[deleted],asktransgender,"TW: depression, suicide: doubting myself because of how much realising I'm trans has affected my mental health (please read last para)","So I finally saw a gender specialist who diagnosed me with gender dysphoria and have to book an appointment with an endocrinologist to be prescribed HRT.

If I could just look like a girl and be a girl I'd be a girl. But I'm so tall, and although my face and body aren't especially masculine they certainly aren't passable. I know a lot of trans people go through a time of not passing and then they eventually pass but I don't know whether I can do it, I'm just so tired. I doubt myself so much because although I've always felt more like a girl than a boy I keep having these anxiety attacks where I think it would just be easier to be genderfluid, or a gay boy, or a drag queen. 

Because being a genderfluid/gay man/drag queen would be so much easier than being a transgender woman who doesn't pass. I don't want to have to deal with being discriminated against constantly. I know people have said that in pictures I look passable but that's not how I look in real life. I'm so tall, I'm like 6'5 or something ridiculous. I don't even want to measure myself because of how tall I am. It literally gives me so much dysphoria. I know its partly my own perception.

I don't know, other trans women who are especially tall (like way over 6 foot) seem to love themselves and not have a problem with it, and like I've tried to do that but there are so many other times where I just feel like what's the point of trying to transition, you left it too late. Which is a really sucky way to feel since I'm only 19 years old.

After typing this all out I've realised how much of it is just my depression telling me things about myself which aren't necessarily true, but I still feel like shit because of how shit being trans is. I don't know, I'm sorry to make a moany whiny post like this but I just needed to vent. I don't know what to do. I really don't want to commit suicide, I know there are so many beautiful things about life and the world we live in but I'm just finding each day I can't seem to motivate myself to do anything. Depression keeps dragging me down and I'm just so tired of fighting it."
horrendousacts,asktransgender,"Did anyone take hops, herbs, etc while waiting?

From what I read, feminizing herbs have shown mixed results in people, and that they take a lot longer than prescription strength.  I'm not looking for a replacement (especially since the cost difference is insane), but I wanted to try phytoestrogens in the interim while I jump through all the hoops.

I have a pretty decent hops connection, so I often have them around from when I homebrewed beer.  I love hop tea, so it's no biggie if it ""doesn't work"".  Just curious."
QuestioningMtF1,asktransgender,"I feel like my sexuality is causing my Trans ""symptoms""?","Ever since puberty (around age 13) I've fantasized as female (I'm AMAB) in my sexual fantasies.

This is most prevalent after masturbation (a focus of my fantasies is having breasts) when it takes awhile to shake this ""body image"" and feeling of phantom breasts. What do you think is going on?

Bunny_Brigade,asktransgender,"NSFW ""Funtime"" and depression/dysphoria, anyone else?","So, this is NSFW obviously.

Whenever I masturbate, I go through a period of depression and just horrible feelings for the next few days.  Like, I have a much harder time facing the mirror and i'm constantly questioning whether this is all just in my head or not.  It goes away after a few days and I go back to my old chipper self, but it's just incredibly horrible and painful to go through.  To make matters worse, I've recently been waking up with horrible anxiety and been dealing with headaches and nausea for the past week or so.  My doctor increase my dosage from 2 mg E to 4 mg about two weeks ago, could this cause it?

SafeHayven,asktransgender,Sick of it all. I just can't take existing as trans anymore.,"CN: Transphobia, depression, dysphoria, hopelessness

I'm so sick of everything. I'm trans and middle aged (in my 30s), which means pretty much every cis person -- except young kids who grew up with trans acceptance -- sees me as a fetching freak. Everyone, even the most liberal of my friends, sees cis and heterosexual as the default: you're born a boy or a girl, raised to be as straight and gender-conforming as possible, and then accepted or rejected (usually rejected) when you come out as different. If you are anything else, you're seen as an anomaly not worthy of consideration at best and an execrable freak at worst. This is simply how it is.

I'm a non-binary person, but the fact remains that, in the eyes of the adult cis world, I was born a boy. Not ""assigned male at birth,"" not ""born a baby,"" born a BOY, a MALE, a HE, who failed HIS duty of becoming a man. At best I'm seen as a male who is transforming into a female (keep in mind that I'm non-binary, not a trans woman), and at worst I'm just seen as some pervertrd delusional man in a dress. Either way, the fact remains that I used to be a guy, and that I was such a shitty man that I had to become something else. Young people today have language that is more affirming, but with middle aged people like me, this is what I have. My conservative family has totally rejected me and won't acknowledge who I am in any way. Even my progressive peers think this way, and it tears me apart. No matter what I do, I'll never be anything more than a man, a guy, or at best someone who used to be a guy.

To make matters worse, I'm being laid off from my job of four years this December. I'll have no income after December 17, and since my gender marker hasn't been changed (because I'm an NB freak and not a proper MtF), I'll have to either job search as male or as some fetching middle aged delusional man who thinks he's not male. Either option is terrifying to me, and the thought of needing to go back into the closet to avoid being homeless makes me sick.

For the first time in a long time, I can say that I honestly want to die. I doubt I'll actually work up the nerve to end my miserable, freakish life, but I have no desire to continue living. I don't want to exist anymore. If I were born 15 years later, I might have had a chance, but in my generation the only options for an NB transsexual freak like me are the closet, homelessness, or death. I'm sick of it all. I just want it to end."
VinylScratch01,asktransgender,Need MTF voice resources,"Locally there is UWMillwaukee they have a transgender program, but they won't answer my calls and apparently have a long waiting list.

Videos would be nice, at least to start, i just need any type of resource that might help me that is in video format of a professional, i tend to not be good at teaching myself new ways to speak but i am very receptive to others teaching me.

femmedaddy1312,asktransgender,supporting closeted girlfriend around her family,"so some context: my girlfriend has been out to friends (supportive &amp; largely queer community) since early June (using her name and they pronouns for maybe close to a year before that). she is out as queer to her family, though not by choice. she was outed by her sister, again, as queer and not a girl. don't think sister had bad intentions and suspect it was a ""testing the waters"" maneuver (sister has rainbow everything everywhere etc etc, we think she's gay too, but that's another story). her family is very accepting of her being queer, though they have asked why she's dating a lady (me, cis lady) if she's gay; her response was that we are both queer... they have gay and trans friends, etc. my girlfriend does not feel ready to come out to them, though seems somewhat interested in being out to her sister, though the whole outing thing raises a trust question there.

i want to spend some time with her and her family and get to know them better. we've had a plan for me to spend a day or two with them soon. i feel concerned about the possibility of accidentally outing her to her family, and also about how it will feel for both of us for me to use deadname and wrong pronouns. it's really important to me to support her in whatever decisions she wants to make surrounding this.

we've talked about this and will definitely continue to do so. i'd love to hear from other folks who maybe have been in similar situations/have advice/experiences to share.

thanks!

ChanelNumberOne,asktransgender,So I just got my prescription and I was curious about the levels.,"I'm mtf if it matters but I don't think it does. 

So I just got my prescription and it is for 1mg estradiol and 100mg once daily for both. My GP said the first month we would start slow and also I know hat some people start on purely anti androgens, but I was curious if this is a normal starting dose. I also have no idea what my levels are but I'm going to ask as soon as I get a hold of him.

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,I'm so lost in losing weight.,"I have a binge eating disorder, and I am overweight, bordeline obese to be honest. And all of it is in male places. I look so bad in feminine clothes. 

But I just have no motivation to lose weight. I try to exercise and limit my calories. And then I'll lose a lot of weight. Then gain it back in a few months. Now because im low on T right now, losing weight is harder. So I just gave up. 

I'm 6'0 and 240 lbs. Alot of fat and Alot of muscle. The muscle will slowly go away but the fat is something I need to work on. 

What's a good weight I should be? Does 170-180 sound reasonable, for a 6ft tall girl with a natural muscly body?

SierraDestruction,asktransgender,I think I'm transgender.,"Hi! My name is Sierra, and I was born biologically a female, but as of recent I've been coming to terms with the fact that I may actually be a boy. Growing up I've always been attracted to more masculine things (video games, action figures, etc.) and I've always put on this tomboy persona most of my life. Until around 7th grade I really wanted to fit in with the other girls so I ditched the boxers and stopped hanging out with guys and started wearing makeup and hanging out with girls more. I would buy tons of makeup, and try to be ""girly"". And while I do enjoy some feminine things, it still didn't feel right to me, especially recently. It didn't make sense to me why, no matter how girly I got, I still never felt right. I blamed it mostly on my self esteem issues, but I'm beginning to realize it's much more than that. Dysphoria was hitting me hard, and I began playing around with the idea of being trans around a year ago when I started looking more into it. I went on Tumblr, Youtube, Instagram, everything trying to see other FTM trans people. I just feels right to me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. I don't know what to do, or how to come to the full realization that I could actually be a boy, or how to tell my loved ones. Thanks for reading this! Much love &lt;3"

    (wow, just typing that was...idk, exiting? but kinda scary?)

So until recently I never thought I was anything other than a guy...well, I never really questioned it. I've never really liked how I look, and I guess maybe in a desperate attempt to assure myself that I really am a guy (even 2 days ago, I still was sure I was male...) I started to let by beard grow out a bit. But a few days ago when I looked at myself in the mirror in a dream, [I saw a girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/57mvlf/had_a_dream_i_was_a_girl_again_trans_or_just_weird/), and I really liked how I looked, (...again, I had to stop typing, I am way too emotional D:) possibly for the first time ever. I know it *was* just a dream, but I think it was my subconscious trying to tell me something. And all of today and yesterday, I just haven't stopped thinking about that dream, and I think I have finally realised what gender dysphoria feels like. I've been confused and close to crying a lot today, but I think I've finally stopped trying to convince myself I'm still a guy....
Also, I think looking at /r/transtimelines/ made me a little less scared...

They don't wanna talk with my about me being transgender.,"Okay so I came out on Thursday, they took it okay but not greatly, they still refer to me by deadname, old pronouns and such. Now, I know these things take time, but today my dad got told by his boss to go home early because he was upset, and he's upset because he's not reacting to my news very well. My parents are trying to seek counselling but I wanna help, and I feel terrible that my dad is going through this because of me. I told my mom that I can provide information for them but she keeps saying there's is nothing I can do and that only I can understand what I'm going through, just like only they understand what they're going through. Basically I just wanna know if there's anything I can do to get passed this behaviour. I don't wanna lose them.

TL;DR - My parents won't talk to me about being transgender, don't want my help, only a ""professional"" opinion."

xerox13ster,asktransgender,Has anyone else found this poem hauntingly relatable? Or another poem?,"We wear the mask that grins and lies,  
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—  
This debt we pay to human guile;  
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,  
And mouth with myriad subtleties. 

Why should the world be over-wise,  
In counting all our tears and sighs?  
Nay, let them only see us, while  
       We wear the mask. 

We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries  
To thee from tortured souls arise.  
We sing, but oh the clay is vile  
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;  
But let the world dream otherwise,  
       We wear the mask!

AltAcc1274,asktransgender,"Came out to dad. It didn't go terribly, but not too well either. Need some opinions","So, I recently came out to my mom, and she seemed to take it pretty well. None of us yelled and we came to a neutral understanding pretty quickly. My mom didn't and still doesn't fully believe I'm trans, but that's fair enough since I only told her about it a few days ago. However, I just came out to my dad, and while there still wasn't any yelling or anything, he isn't convinced in the slightest that I am transgender. He made some good points, and thinks the therapist will show that I'm not trans. He wasn't mad at me, but he just believes that I am incorrect. I didn't really assert myself as I didn't want to rile him up, but I don't know how it will go if the therapist says that I am transgender and I have to tell my dad the results. What do you all think of this situation? EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have already found and scheduled an appointment with a therapist. She isn't a straight up gender therapist, but she covers a wide range of things, including transgender. It was the best I could get with the current situation. My parents didn't want a gender therapist because they thought that the therapist would only say that I'm trans. Their logic makes sense to me, but hopefully the therapist I am going to will still say that I'm trans."

Step 2 is difficult for me because I can easily raise my larynx without swallowing up to the point it is when I do swallow, just by ""raising my voice"". Like pretend you're about to sing a high note. Is this wrong? Am I misunderstanding it?

Step 5 basically seems impossible to me. If I start in falsetto and work my way down to my normal voice, nothing happens when I ""cross the gap"". I'm just using my normal voice at a higher note than usual. I feel like I'm just misunderstanding all of this.

The last thing right now is just.... how do you practice this when you're never really alone in your house? There isn't really a moment for me when I can actually practice this without anyone hearing.

connekt2net,asktransgender,"How common is this? ""I wish I was...""","I've only been aware of being trans for about two years, and only just now getting around to figuring things out in that aspect, though I've been trans my whole life. 

I've wished I was a girl my entire life. Literally wished. Sat in my bed and falling asleep chanting that I wish I was a girl under my breath or in my head as early as I could remember. Yet it took until a couple years ago to figure out that I legitimately want to be a girl. Like obviously it was legitimate from the get go, but I guess what I mean is like actually realizing that I *am* a girl rather than wishing that I was. It's just funny because I never capitalized on my thoughts, or told anyone, because it just didn't seem like something that was possible. So eventually. Despite continuing to absentmindedly wish for this, it just became habit. Like it was a habit to wish for that. It wasn't something I even paid attention to anymore. It was like breathing or blinking. 

But I guess now that I'm going through therapy looking back on the fact I've always had that thought, it's kind of made the diagnosis process go by a bit quicker, because it was never just a sudden thing or sudden realization, it was just that once I realized it was possible I finally decided to start looking into it. Finding information was easy, but gathering the courage to actually approach someone for this was the most difficult part. 

**My question for y'all is, how common is it to experience dysphoric things but not realize it's possible to change things, or not recognize them as actual... I don't know. Feelings? I might not be 100% clear on this, but what I mean is like, knowing you wish you were a girl, but perhaps being too logical to think that changing is impossible.**"

likeClockwork7,asktransgender,What if I don't think of myself as a girl? (Questioning if I could be transgender),"For about a week now I have been considering the possibility that I could be transgender. Details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/59zadg/how_likely_is_it_that_this_is_just_a_phase_long_d/), but you don't need to read that to understand my question. I'm a 17-year-old male who experiences little, possibly no dysphoria, and have not questioned my gender at all up until a week ago. One thing I keep seeing is that transgender means you think of yourself as, in an MtF case, a female in a male body. You are female, and want to have a female body.

This is in conflict with my thinking, which has been that I am male, but I want to be female. I don't consider myself female, and I don't think I could without having a female body.

Is this something that happens to some late-onset transgender people, or does it indicate that I am most likely not transgender, even if currently becoming female sounds very appealing? Or is it a way of thinking that occurs before one fully accepts that he/she is trans, and the thinking changes after a certain point in transition?"

Hello everyone, my name’s Allison (at least, that’s what I want to go by)! I’m in need of some advice. I’m twenty and I’ve been on HRT since August 8th, 2016. I’m fairly happy with the results so far but I’m also pretty clueless about some stuff. I’m not even close to presenting female though. Below are some questions I have. I’m open to any answers or advice you might have.

**Hair:**
The last time I got a haircut of any kind was March 2015. Unfortunately, my hair is a wild, curly mess. I’m also worried that it’s unhealthy. Last year I kinda had a meltdown and stopped taking care of myself. I’m worried that the way I treated my hair then may be adversely affecting my hair now.

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/4uANF)

From the pictures you can probably see that I have a horrendous hairline. Part of that is just genetics but I also think that part of it may have been from stress. I’m hoping that it will get better with time now that I’m on E. I’ve also noticed some shorter hairs on top of my head. I feel like they could be breakage from last year, new breakage, or regrowth. My hair is also really horrible thin in the front. This is partially from having a widow’s peak and hair loss due to stress.
Any ideas?	

**Styling:**                                                                                                                                                     I really can’t/don’t know how to style my hair. I part it down the center and that’s it. Occasionally I’ll part it down the center and sweep one side behind an ear (really wild, I know). I try doing different things with it but jesus is it a fickle mistress. I’ll try to do something simple like a side part but since my hair is so curly it just starts frizzing out and I panic and end up putting it back. The wind is also the bane of my existence. I take forever trying to make my hair bearable, take one step outside and it’s instantly ruined.
So, advice? About any of that mess?

**Anxiety:**                                                                                                                                                    Ok, so I almost definitely need a haircut or at least a trim. As stupid as it sounds though, I’m scared. I have a lot of social anxiety as is but it’s always been worse with haircuts. Before I started growing out my hair I always got the same kind of short, masculine haircut. I’d always just bring in a picture of myself with said masculine haircut and say, “Just do that.” Now I don’t know what to say. I’m going to school in rural Michigan (which is essentially the South of the North if you know what I mean). I’m kinda worried about using a picture of or requesting a feminine cut.
So, I guess I’m looking for any advice about overcoming this anxiety/talking to a hairdresser. 

**Acne:**                                                                                                                                                       I’ve had acne my entire teenage/adult life and I’m pretty sick of it. I know that it should be getting gradually better now that I’m on E but honestly it seems like it is getting worse lately. 

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/SOG6c)

Shaving also seems to be making it worse. Both regular and electric razors seem to just aggravate my acne. 
Any advice on my routine or shaving/acne?

**Face:**                                                                                                                                                            I guess I don’t really have a clear question regarding my face. You can see it in either of the picture links above. I’m just worried about my chin and jaw and how masculine/square everything looks.
Is there any hope for me outside of FFS?

**Adams Apple:**                                                                                                                                              In case you haven’t gotten a good look of it in other pictures, here’s what my Addams apple looks like.

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/NjLSS)

My feelings about this area of my body range from intense hatred to “dear god why!”  I mean, for fucks sake, I was known as the kid with the big Adam’s apple in high school. That definitely didn’t leave any lasting damage (it did).
So, I know that voice training may help hide my Adams apple a bit but is there anything else? I’m 90% sure I’ll need a tracheal shave at some point but there’s no way I can afford to do that any time soon. Would chokers help hide it? Is there anything I can really do about it or am I just shit out of luck?

**Shaving:**                                                                                                                                                  This one may be kinda silly or obvious to some people, but… how in god’s name am I supposed to get a clean shave on areas like the back of my knees? I unfortunately have extremely hairy legs. So yeah… any advice about that or hair removal in general would be appreciated.

**Makeup:**                                                                                                                                                       I have no idea what I’m doing with makeup but I’d really like to start experimenting to find my style. Problem is, I’m both cheap and short on money. 
Do any of you know of any good/cheap makeup kits for beginners? 

Sorry that this is so long. I’ve sort of been bottling up these questions for a while now. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have. Any advice, even if unrelated to my questions, would be greatly appreciated. Also, please don't be afraid to drop any hard truths on me. I'd rather know where I stand than go on thinking I'm doing fine when I'm not. Thank you for taking time to help. Stay positive!

**TLDR: I’m a mess and need some serious help with my hair and appearance.**

DSMTrans,asktransgender,What are the DSM requirements for being a transgender woman?,Do the DSM requirements apply to people in the UK?
throwmeway_imtrash,asktransgender,Cis gay man- unsure if I should date a trans guy I have feelings for?,"Disclaimer: I couldn't fit this into the title, but my main motivation for asking this question is to avoid triggering dysphoria and hurting the feelings of someone I already have feelings for and care about a lot. also content warning, anyone who doesn't want to read an account of someone not sure if they like a trans persons' body look away now 

So here goes: I’m developing feelings for a trans dude and I need some advice. 

The backstory is - I moved into a house with some people, including a trans guy.I thought he was kinda cute but I left it at that, soon we started hanging out. At first it was as friends, but over time we became more or less best mates and shared a lot about our past. I supported him through some mental health stuff, and vice versa, and before I know it this has built and built to the point where I have really strong feelings which I’m 99% sure are reciprocated (we’ve kinda talked around the fact we’re into each other without really saying it directly). Like, I’m already in that sort of intoxicating heartachey stage of liking him, thinking about him all the time, all that good stuff. It feels like the point where we would start officially dating if we were ever going to, but I have been putting it off and sort of seeing a little less of him because . . . 

. . . Real talk, I am honest to god not entirely sure that I could, at the end of the day, put my D in a V (and enjoy it, stay hard, etc). I’m gay and while I’m not thinking ‘no thank you, absolutely not’ I'm not exactly unambiguously saying 'aw yes bring on the v' either. I’m acutely aware that I won’t actually really know how I feel until I’m already there.

Although I was bisexual for 2-3years, my final experiences with vaginas were far from positive - basically involved me feeling uncertain about whether I was really gay, and going with girls a couple of times, getting to the point where'd be about to have sex and clothes would come off and me losing my boner and any sense of being into it, so I had to make shitty 'actually I don't think I can do this' excuses. Like up until recently I just thought of these episodes as just another stupid thing I did as a teenager, but it's casting a long shadow now because of A: my reaction then was a pretty clear 'no thanks', why would it be different now? and B: how much my reaction upset the girls involved. 

I feel like a huge idiot for not really considering this up until now. What do I do? If I’m not certain but I go for it, and I end up not being able to perform then obviously this is a massive horrible dysphoria trigger and I already care about him a lot and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. But at the same time I feel like shutting things down *just in case* isn’t much better, especially since we live in the same damn house. Am I jumping to conclusions by even thinking this far ahead? I just don't know 

Like I know housemates shouldn’t fuck anyway but on top of that I just feel like whichever option I choose has a high likelihood of me hurting his feelings and being, by extension, a prick. I’m feeling guilty that I’m so unsure whether I want to ask this guy out because he ticks every box except for what’s in his pants, but mainly I just want to not hurt the feelings of someone I care about.

any advice please?  

e d i t: 

* From conversations we've had, somewhat sure he still goes for the D in V type situations. but i just don't know, I guess I did jump to conclusions a bit 
* so help me god there will not be strap ons "

overlysound,asktransgender,So.... dating while transitioning,"So I've been on HRT for a year and a couple months. I haven't really made a push yet to try and pass (and I probably would not). My E levels were way too low first 7 months, I've only recently started laser, and have not started on my voice. HRT is definitely doing things, but slowly--but I' am ok with taking my time with my transition. I've gotten to a level of routine and a feeling of emotionally stability (HRT has certainly helped me).

Now I've gotten to the point to where I think there is some room in my life for someone else. I mean for the first time in my life I actually want to date someone, and I've finally realized I' am only into men (for background the only person I've dated in the past is a woman). So how do I go about this tricky business?

I will likely start with online dating apps, and I live in NYC so no shortage of people. However, the obvious problem is I don't know how long it will take me to go full time, and I need to be upfront with anyone that I' am trans and over the next few years I will physically change. Is that worth just stating in my profile? Does anyone have experience and advice to offer?

On the other hand, I'de be ok with putting off dating for a while longer.

I don't understand how a cis person would have done this. Does this alone pretty much guarantee I'm not CIS? Is this gender dysphoria??"
BerryKnight,asktransgender,"Could questions RE: Hormones, also helping my girlfriend deal with things while I do","Now that it's looking like I'll be on hormones soon, I'm kinda hyped and terrified at the same time, right now I'm more or less just existing rather than living, I struggle with cleaning, self-care and even doing things I want to do for fun...I'm really pinning a lot of hope on hormones changing at least a little of that, I have dreams I want to bring to fruition but as I am I doubt they'll ever be anything more than dreams....am I putting too much hope in this? Will it just be a tiny difference, will I be any happier? Will I be able to enjoy things again? This is kinda my last hope for any of that

throwaway_I_love_it,asktransgender,I'm scared and confused,"First of all, I'm 18, born a male, and just started Uni. Some of this stuff has been in my life for quite a while now, but they've only become issues recently. Sorry for the long post, I tend to ramble when I'm anxious TL;DR at the end.

My main issue, is my gender, I don't know if that's the right way to put it. Years ago, sometimes after I started exploring my sexuality, I discovered ""Cross-dressers"", and later (at about 15), I tried it myself. Ever since then, I liked the thought of looking like a girl and being pretty. I'd even be envious of girls I'd see at school or on the street and sometimes girls in porn too. Just yesterday I saw some stuff about transgender people, gender dysphoria, etc, and I had a dream that I was being tested for gender dysphoria, but in the dream, I specifically asked for the test. After I woke up, I haven't been able to get the thought out of my head. but I don't dislike my body, I don't even want breasts(maybe small ones), and I definitely want to keep my current genitals. But I also really want to seen as a girl.

I've been doing some research and discovered this sub and my hearts been beating faster the more I read. What I ask of you is, what should I do? I have a really close friend I've known for 12 years who I trust and usually talk to about life issues and he's never judged me for anything. I also have a less close friend and she recently became trans, so I might ask her how she knew. I'm scared of talking to my parents about it, I have anxiety and if they pulled me aside to talk about this, no matter how accepting, I'd probably pass out from an anxiety attack. I see a psychiatrist for other issues, I don't see her for at least a few months I think, I might talk to her about it, I don't know yet.


TL;DR: I might be Trans, I'm scared and confused. I don't want a vagina, or even boobs (maybe super small ones), but I want to be a girl. What do I do?


EDIT: I forgot to mention, maybe this is important, I don't know, I always have thoughts of wishing I could switch between being a girl and me as I am now whenever I want, I think switching back mostly because if I became a girl overnight that would throw my whole life upside down. I also, more often, have thoughts that if I could restart my life and nothing changes at all except my gender, I would take that chance immediately."
throwawaytransgirl24,asktransgender,"Hey FTM guys, here is something I learned about getting an attractive masculine jaw and tighter skin","So I found out that the masculine jaw is actually sooo much muscle. I was always told I have beautiful jaws and I realized after HRT that it was all muscle. I used to eat a lot of really hard chewy candy called ""Hi-Chew"" I would try to even put more of an exercise on my jaw by constantly rotating the same piece with my tongue and pressing down hard again. I didn't do it for a big jaw, just as stress reliever during finals. I can tell you that after stopping that and HRT, my jaw literally went from beautifully manly (in line with Matt Bomers) to androgynous and there is still so much muscle left based on me touching my bone and feeling the area so I'm hoping for a feminine one to make my cheekbones pop more. I measured it in an old picture by using the width of my nose and scale it in reference. I lost .15 inches on each side. So that's .3 inches on your face. If you have a less elastic skin, that's pretty much a free and nice face lift too. That's just my two cents as a trans girl and I wanted to contribute to you beautiful people's lives :)  I usually get downvoted no matter what but I don't care, I just hope this helps someone out there feel and look beautiful."
ShellieHart,asktransgender,Growing Breasts and Arm Movement Obstruction?,"For those of you who have had a lot of breast growth like I have, how has your new breasts obstructed your arm movements? Whenever I move my arms in any kind of forward motion or across my chest I now rub heavily against my breasts, sometimes really smashing one of them and it can be uncomfortable. I can no longer cross my arm conveniently over my breast to pick things up off my desk as I once did. I really (mostly accidentally) smash my breast down to try to move as freely as I used to. In your experience, does it get more and more obstructive for your arms as you grow? 

I hope this question is not too weird here, but this is an issue that keeps getting my attention all day and is getting more and more noticeable every day as my breasts increase in size and protrusion. After 7 months HRT, I am still growing quite fast...."
-clare,asktransgender,The dividing line between being 'visibly trans' and your preferred gender is incredibly thin,"For example. The last time I got called sir/gendered male or even recognized as trans. Weeks ago now. Like 2-3. Ironically a few days before I got my birth certificate with the big ""F"" on it :)

It happened for a myriad of reasons. A lack of confidence. My voice. My motions. The way I looked at and perceived myself. One thing sort of bounced off another. Thinking 'I can't do this because x!'. 

x being any reason you'll create to hold yourself back.

It was sudden. The change. I gave in completely. I let go. I became comfortable. Hormones work, but you need to, too. 

When it all came together, to the world I simply became another girl. No more weird questions or words of encouragement. No more weird looks or intense examination of 'are they or aren't they'? Just.. Clare..

It all stopped at once. 

You can change more than you think. 

And things can change in *days*. Those days you think mean nothing, that are in the way to where you want to be, are the days you are learning the fundamentals. Where you build, even if you don't see it or feel it. Progress is being made, there are no wasted days in transition. 

One week can be entirely different from another for us.
This moment, is not forever. You are changing. One day, if you work on it, and don't give up, you will cross that very thin line and never want to go back, and you don't have to.

nmi1000,asktransgender,"How to deal with dysphoria when you are not sure you can transition, or want to transition","Wanted to post my experience for anyone who is not sure about transitioning, or has a life where transition would be too much of an issue (family/career/etc)

Low dose HRT was the solution for me. I basically took a 2mg estrofem pill every other day. It feminized me a little so that I look more feminine when I dress and really helped with dysphoria. I am still not entirely sure I ever want to transition - perhaps I like myself too much as I am now to make major changes. 

For the longest time I was hesitant to try hormones, but it's not a ""all or nothing"" deal, a low dosage really helps figure things out and make things better, if full on transition is not something you are sure about.

AshleyorAdam,asktransgender,I do not know what to do,I have been fighting that I should have been a girl my whole life. Mostly because of my super Christian family and growing up in church and hearing the preaching against things like this which makes you feel even  worse. I fought the memories of going in my sister's room and wearing her clothes I did not want to remember that because I did not want people thinking I was less of a man. I worked hard to be as manly as I could be but still would wear women's clothing in secret like they were calling to me and I started to think it was sexual because I was turned on by it and the thought of being a woman but the memories came back and the thought of how jealous of other girls I am because I wish I was them and I think that is why I think my relationships do not work out because I want to be them and how scared of sex I am. I hate being in control and worried that I suck at it. I have been trying to be what my family wants and latey I can't fight the feeling no more. I am 30 now and it's all I think about but I know I will lose my family because it is against everything they believe and the thought of never seeing my nephews again kills me. I been so depressed latey and I just want to be happy but I am so scared that everyone will treat me like I am a freak but I can't change how I feel believe me I tried. I just don't know what to do. I can't tell anyone how I feel because I am too afraid. Thank you for reading.

so i saw my endo today and talked to him about taking an AA other than spiro (because spiro a shit and my T levels are still high) and basically he said ""okay it's not FDA approved here so I'll write you a perscription for a pharmacy in Canada""

And that's exactly what he did. He asked me what dose I wanted and I said 12.5mg (a number I pulled out of my ass because I had no idea what the actual dose is) and he just wrote that down and said to call a pharmacy in Canada and tell them I have the script.

Would that work? What should I do? is 12.5mg the right dose to take? Not really sure where I got that number from, but yeah that's what he wrote down. What do i Do next? Anyone with experience with this? How the heck do I get a perscription filled in a foreign country, and how do I even get my hands on the drug itself?

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,[MtF] Beard grows more and more,"My beard grows more and more... Some time ago I had to shave only once a week, now it's literally 3 times a day. I shave in the morning and can feel the beard and see a shadow already by noon.

I'd been on it for two years before realising that I was trans, and wondering if it could be influencing how i feel about things. It's given me reduced body hair and mild gyno, both of which I like. Maybe it just opened my eyes to messing with my hormones? 

I mean I can construct a lifetime narrative that shows I had a thread running through my whole life, so I doubt it truly manifested because of a reduction in DHT...

I came out to my brother yesterday. That felt better kinda. And today I tried.  But in my current state I really zoned out and fell into a really deep hole.

On the eve of going out to permanently change my body, I consider what I've been given.

A fresh start; in public school, I was ill-suited to the company of boys, and a creepy puzzle to girls. Homeschooled, I was alone with my thoughts of something being incongruous about me. Southern Baptist curriculum did nothing to help me unravel the mysteries.

I am a woman; though plagued by sadness, this is what I must do. I go to Montréal, with the express intent of getting my genitalia filleted and violently corrected. 

I will come back, and I will report back in. My gf will be waiting on me hand-and-foot, and I can't miss out on that, now; can I?

pm_me_your_dresses,asktransgender,"RE: Hair length, and past hair length.","So, for just over a year a half now, I've been growing out my hair. It's (*sighs*) still not shoulder length, but it's easily twice as long as I'd ever had it before. I'm still not completely happy with it, but it's definitely so much more comfortable than anything I've ever had before that I can't exactly complain.

This morning, Facebook 'On This Day' notifications happened to bring up a couple of photos from a year and two years ago, and I was genuinely blind-sided by them. I've never considered my hair length to be a huge part of my identity or how I view myself, but looking at those pictures (even though they were pretty recent), I feel like I'm looking at a complete stranger. Growing it out has made me so happy (apart from my unfortunately pretty obvious receding hairline, but oh well) that just thinking about when I had short hair is enough to make me cringe from how terrifyingly uncomfortable it would be if I were forced to cut my hair that short again now.

Normally I'm only really interested in fingering, cunnilingus, and kissing or being penetrated by strap on but lately I've been having this sort of extreme hypersexuality. I've been almost constantly horny and I've been having constant dreams and turn ons to the idea of penetrating using my penis. Usually I'm not attracted to the idea of using it but these last few weeks my sexuality has gone wild and it's really bothering me. It makes me feel EXTREMELY unfeminine, wrong, and disgusting. I feel so disappointed in myself and it's really depressing me. It makes me feel really masculine and I hate it, it makes me question whether I even want to live or not and I feel like I may be alone. It sometimes makes me even question if I'm trans or not but I've wanted to be a woman long before I ever even felt sexual attraction and the idea of being a woman isn't really a turn on, it's more of a... I don't know, it's hard to explain. It just feels correct in very single way far beyond just sex, even if I were unable to feel sexual attraction I would want to be a woman. I almost always sexually fantasize about being a woman with another woman, yes but what else am I supposed to be when a fantasize? A man? It's not really a fetish that turns me on, it's just the only way I can comfortably portray myself and the only way that feels right in all situations, including sexual ones. I can remember wanting to be a woman for as long as I've really been aware there was a difference between the two sexes and genders but for years I've struggled with it. At first I struggled to stay male against my wants to be female, but now that I've accepted I'm trans I now live in fear and constant paranoia that I may not be trans after all and then when I have stuff like this happen it starts making everything fall apart. This isn't the first time I've felt this masculine hypersexuality, it's happened several times before but it always eventually faded away and everything returned to normal but every time it pushes me into existential crisis. Am I alone in having this? How do I handle this? What's happening to me?"

i asked my doctor if i can maybe take supplements to help it grow faster and he told me that there aren't enough researches about it that says it really works.

its frustrating, i always wanted a very longer down to my lower back and it doesn't seem ill get there.

Also if I masturbate after a day or two of abstaining the feeling goes from bad to absolute shit.

asktransgener,asktransgender,"NSFW Started dating a mtf pre-op transgender. She loves sex and all its trappings, but...","she hates her genitalia (she's hoping to have them removed next year), and she is pretty much impotent. That's not a problem for me (I'm a guy by the way) - I ignore them and we kinda just pretend they aren't there, but it does put me in quite a confusing situation: Usually when I'm with a woman in the bedroom I don't like being selfish and always try to bring them to a climax, and make sure they have a cool time. So this situation is confusing because bringing her to a climax is not an option, so how do I be an unselfish lover? I'm wondering if there are any pre-op mtf in a similar situation here - who hate doing anything with their own genitals, but apart from that love foreplay and sex. How do you 'get off' then? What do you like about the sex - is it an emotional mental pleasure, rather than a physical one? Are you not sometimes left feeling somewhat frustrated, because you can't 'climax'?

Sorry if I put this crudely, or have used any inappropriate language, the post is meant in good faith and I have full respect for the trans community."

leftcat,asktransgender,"I'm starting to seriously regret not freezing sperm before HRT, and I don't know what to do.","Hi lovely people!

I'm a 27 year old trans woman, full time for about 2 months and on HRT for about 10. I'm writing this because I could really do with some comforting words right now. When I started HRT, I was miserable with dysphoria, and I couldn't think of ever wanting to bring another life into the world. I'm not blaming her because I am an adult, and it was my decision, but my specialist was perhaps not the greatest on this topic. She asked if I wanted kids, and I said I didn't really - she then essentially said ""well look you could freeze sperm but the whole thing is a bit expensive so don't worry about it"" and that was that. 

10 months later and my life is pretty fantastic, I'm finally who I've always wanted to be - but I have this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I've made a terrible decision. I don't know who to talk to about it, and even seeing happy families and smiling kids makes me deeply sad about what I gave up just because I couldn't see a happy future for myself. I know it was my decision and my choice as an adult - and that makes it all the worse, because I barely recognise myself at that time.  I just keep picturing a future where I might want to start a family with a lovely girl and being unable to. 

I guess I'm just wondering how I even begin to process this, or if anyone else has been through the same thing, and how you processed it. 

TL;DR Didn't freeze sperm before starting HRT because I was a big ol misanthrope - life's great now, I regret it deeply and I don't know how to deal. "

gaia1852,asktransgender,[Update on being outted to my parents],"Previously on Gaia's problems: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/557fd6/my_parents_know_they_were_told_by_someone_i/

So, I talked to my parents on friday, but now the fallout is coming in.

My dad was crying in church today sitting next to me. He wanted to talk to me at a diner later today, but I made an excuse and got out of it. I still want to talk to him, but he keeps on wanting to do it in public places, which gives me additional stress. I don't know how to do it on my terms. Any recommendations?

My mom was the opposite, she was quite willing to talk on the phone, but she obviously doesn't understand. She outted me to her doctor friend, and now she is begging me to not do anything ""biological"" for her, and trying to ask me if I am not just gay. She told me she still loves me, but she is obviously scared for me. She lives far away from me, so it's a bit easier to do phone calls, but I want her to understand that this isn't really a choice, but instead a hormonal imbalance problem. I want to tell her that I have been jealous of girls since I was really young, cross dressing in private, crying over being called masculine, but it's so hard to broach the issue with her. Especially since all she's seen of my is the overly masculine character I play in public. Any recommendations there?

And, finally, there is the problem of that teacher who outted me. I don't hate her, I don't want to hurt her because of what she did to me, but I am scared for any students that come out to her in the future. I am relatively safe, my parents are liberal and loving. But it's so dangerous to out people like this, I feel like she has already damaged my relationship with my parents, and made coming out so much more traumatic than it needed to be. I want to make sure her county school board knows, so they can do something, but I don't really know how to do that. Any recommendations there?

Also... can I have a hug, I think I kinda need it after the past few days. :("

DaenerysTargaryen3,asktransgender,Can a FtM Top surgery be covered by insurance? How do I make my fiance as comfortable as possible in own skin.,"My fiance is FtM trans, but EXTREMELY against body modifications like this due to spiritual reasons, but my partner is EXTREMELY uncomfortable in her body, mostly her chest. She's okay with being called female, long story short we are spiritual and believe in past lives and we already know that we've spent time together in other lives and that her spirit is male, that she is going through this life as a woman for a reason, and that she picked this life for a reason. 

Plus she feels that it would cause more attention to her to try and call her male pronouns in public or with friends since 1) Even though it's very obvious for anyone who interacts with her, I'm the only person she's ever ""came out"" to as trans and hasn't officially told her parents or sweet little catholic grandma and 2) She knows she is still a female physically and feels it would draw more attention to her to try and call her male pronouns in public. We usually just go with avoiding any kind of gender pronouns in public, but sometimes it just happens and she's accepted that.

She also has depression, is extremely shy and introverted, and we are working on all of that and just surrounding her with love. I'll do whatever it takes to make her happy, I don't care if she's a guy or a girl (would prefer girl bits downstairs, but truly I don't care). I know that a huge part of her depression stems from her being insecure about her body. Now, the only part of her body she is really insecure about is her chest. She has said that she doesn't want to do the downstairs surgery mostly because it goes against what she spiritually believes (no body modifications other than what they could have done in the wild. So piercings and tattoos are okay, but if the natives couldn't do it she doesn't want to do be apart of it for her own spirituality sake) and also because no one other than us will see that part. But, according to her, everyone can tell she has some chest (Probably an a or b cup tops). I have to work full time and can't be there for her during the day (also she's in between jobs at the moment) and I keep encouraging her to do things with her brothers (not by blood but closer than that) and she broke down the other day and explained why she doesn't want to. 

Literally her favorite activities are surfing and skating, but she doesn't want to go surfing with her brothers because wet suites are tight and when things get cold, yeah. She doesn't want to go skating because she's worried about if her shirt flies up, or air gets in the arm holes, etc, that *someone* will see. (I know no one is looking,but she knows and cares and that's all that matters to me).

I'm looking into buying her a binder first(She's entirely too self conscious to even look into things like that right now, so yay for the extroverted fiance who does crazy things like ask reddit where to buy binders) so that she can feel a bit more comfortable in her own skin, but I saw somewhere once that the top surgery can be covered with insurance?? We don't have a lot of money, especially with her being out of work, but is this even something that could be considered looking into? Fuck man, I'll do whatever it takes to help her get out of her depression. I know getting engaged is not the cure for depression, I'm not looking at our relationship to help her, but I can't sit by and see her be so uncomfortable or so upset in her own skin when it's something I have the power (maybe) to help with.....

Any advice would be great, I think this turned more into a rant than anything, so if you made it this far thanks! But yeah advice would be fucking great, happy Samhain everyone! "

I'm a super feminine trans girl. i love pretty much everything girly. i really dont like anything stereo-typically masculine, except for cars. before i came out or even began my transition i got my first BMX which i loved to ride. i havent rode it in months, and at this point i'm out, i've been on lupron for 6 months and im starting spiro tomorrow. i identify as a girl 100% and i absolutely love it, and it feels completely right.

Heres my dilemma; riding a bmx is mostly known for guys to do it, and its actually quite rare to find other female riders. I want to be seen as a girl to people and i am, *sometimes*, as i present androgynous super feminine, and im close to being girl mode full time. i really wanna start to ride my bmx again, continuing to learn tricks (for me, bunny hop), and just enjoying the exercise. but i dont know if i can, im worried ill either appear or be seen as male to everyone while i ride, or that ill feel like im invalidated because i know im this really girly girl, but im doing a ""guy"" thing.

i hate gender norms and how everyone genders not living items and things, like *fucking colours*. i want to ride my bmx again but i dont think i can as it will trigger my gender dysphoria and ill feel extremely invalidated and not feminine - who i am.

what should i do? how can i get past this? should i just give up on riding the beautiful bike i got for christmas?

tdkerfuffle,asktransgender,Transphobic woman at gym showers almost attacked me,"Today I faced the worst instance of transphobia that I've ever experienced...

I was at the gym, I go there regularly. It's an openly LGBT friendly gym. I mostly swim there. When I was done I went to take a shower. The showers are communal. Having been raised a nudist this is no big deal for me. I've been coming here for two years and there are a lot of trans women here. Just last week in the showers I saw a trans woman washing up with her dick out there facing the world. In these two years nobody has ever blinked at me being trans. Nobody gives a shit. It's just a freaking penis. It won't eat anyone.

But today this crazy woman came to me from my behind, touched my shoulders and when I turned back, she screamed and kept saying she has a cock she has a cock! I told her to shut up but she had completely freaked out. She had a soap in her hand which she threw at my dick (she missed, it hit my leg. I'm glad it didn't hit my balls! Or it could have been really painful). She said I had no right to be there but I said I do this place is trans friendly but she called me a liar and came towards me in a hostile manner but at that point another girl came between us and told her to fuck off. She was young (19 or 20 maybe) but she was very kind and asked if I was ok. That woman went and said she'll ""report"" me. She left.

When I came out, the manager told me that they've cancelled that woman's membership and on top of that I've been given a free three month extension! At least something good in the end.

But oh my god. Some people are crazy. But when I told my sister about it she reminded me that I had two years of zero issues there, and then everyone was on my side. This shows most people are good.

hazyways,asktransgender,Facial Electrolysis in MD/DC Area - Where to Go?,"Hello all!

This is... my first real outreach redditwards. I've been lurking, researching, and reading things left right and center (on here and other places), but I'm kind of dead-ending on a next step and am kind of hoping I could find some help here!

The past year for me has brought with it a lot of progress in terms of actually pursuing my transition. I'm out to the entirety of my friendbase (who're wholly supportive), my family (who're still adapting), and even a few trusted coworkers. I've also been attending therapy for a bit now, which has proved a great bit of reinforcement and help.

Here's the wrinkle, though. My current insurance plan wouldn't cover HRT, and (to my understanding) I wouldn't yet be able to get the ball rolling even with informed consent. The good news is that I have an opportunity to swap over to a plan that'll cover it soon, and that I should be able to have everything in place to begin pretty dang early next year.

I don't want to put the brakes on everything just due to this, though. I want to keep moving. To that end, I've been trying to find somewhere to get electrolysis in order to start dealing with my facial hair for good.

But... I've been coming up dry. I keep running up against:
1. Websites that've last been updated circa 2005
2. Places that seem to offer only thermolysis (which, with the potential scarring and low kill rate of hairs, I'd prefer to avoid)
3. Places that seem to lack reviews or confirmations of success, that I can see
4. General lack of surety that anything is ""current""

And this brings me to why I'm reaching out. I'm currently located in central Maryland, for reference, and am able and willing to travel a bit to find a good locale. By any chance, could anyone out there recommend a good source for permanent facial hair removal in the Maryland/DC area?

Thank you very much in advance for your time, and thank you even more for any suggestions!"

MADmaroi,asktransgender,How can you be Trans/Gay and christian? (Rant),"First off i don't care what you believe in as long as it doesnt harm anyone else or force your opinions on anyone that does not want to be communed with. I've gone to a christian school for the majority of my schooling and i was turned away from religion through science logical thinking and after spending years with my head held in a bible, which was really quite a sick book tbh also hanging around with these narrow sighted cold blooded Christians all day at school didn't help with all the trans &amp; homophobic devotions. I'm sorry, but it doesnt work that way, the bible and Christianity are from the middle east so i don't know why you hate Islam when it is really quite the same thing just dulled down and not acted upon as literally as Islam. These verses most from the old testament are not irrelevant, it is God's book and he did say them after all, everything in there is him no exceptions take it or leave it, no nitpicking. (Leviticus 18:21-22) (Leviticus 20:13) (Romans 1:26)/ (1 Timothy 2:12) (Ephesians 5:22)


Like can we be serious, it's 2016 and there this; 'When men fight with one another, and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him, and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts, then you shall cut off her hand. (Deuteronomy 25:11-12)

Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. (1 Corinthians 14:34)

Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered. Matthew 21:18-22 NIV.

Come on people it is just silliness all the pain and suffering that religion has caused us and the rest of the LGBT+ community and anyone that did not submit to a life of worship.
I'm sorry, i'm just just sick of the perfect christians at my school having everything, and walking through life with no worries or problems like being gay or trans and for those of us that are not ""normal'' like them or do/are something different to get immediately shut down and shamed it's so hypocritical like most of them are. Jesus even said it '1 John 4:20'. Their eyes are glazed over from the harshness of the real world and i don't know how you could support something that is so crazy and out of date. idk, im sorry i shouldn't have posted this i'm just sick of it all. I should be happy for what i do have which is a lot more than some people in the world.

Mods if you don't think this is appropriate for this reddit please just say and i will take it down, please no bias.

Stranger1694,asktransgender,Is there other way to remove facial hair (permanently) except electrolysis and laser?,"Hi. I don’t know what do. My facial hair is very annoying me now, like never before. I know that there are ways to remove it permanently, but there are real problems which prevent to do that. And my suicidal thoughts came back. Oh, when I started HRT I was the happiest man on the planet, my depression had gone. But now everything is not okay. Maybe it’s my fault that I didn’t plan how I will do remove my facial hair, but I wanted to start HRT and nothing else was important. I just had to do it.

At first I started to tweeze hair. It lasted for 3 months. It was hard and took a lot of time but the effect was pretty good, except ingrown hair. But then I found out that tweezing and waxing can harm hair, and electrolysis won’t be effective. I said “Okay”, and stopped tweezing. Then I started to shave. But the effect of shaving is bad, really bad. I see dark hair on my face and it hurts me. I see the stubble and it destroys me. What the heck… After the first shaving and its bad result, I began immediately to search for electrolysis and laser in my city. And I found out that I can’t afford it. Laser is very expensive, electrolysis is average but it needs much more procedures. I’m studying now, and can only work three days in a week. My parents don’t know about me, and it seems to me they’ll just “kill” me if they find out. So I don’t expect help from them.

I’ve heard about Rivanol (Ethacridine Lactate, antiseptic) and tried to use it, but there was no effect.

Maybe I should go back to tweezing? But what about electrolysis?

P.S. Before HRT there was a time when I visited an electrolysis cosmetologist, and I just wanted to get a consultation – ask for price, how much time will it take and etc. Instead of that I received an interrogation. Our conversation was like this: “Why do you want to do that? You do it now, but then change your mind, and I don’t wanna have any problems.” After all I just turned around and walked away. But then I thought a lot about it: «Maybe I should have told her who I am, and why I want to do this»

P.S (2) I’m from Russia."

I've watched several documentaries on the subject such as ""I am Legend"" and ""28 Days Later"", which have helped me prepare, but when I think about it, being trans leads to issues that some of the survivors in those documentaries don't have to deal with such as finding hormones and harvesting pickles. I'm guessing the girls, guys, and non binary folks will have different sets of issues, but as a community I feel like we can all help each other get through this. 

I'm wondering if we can share our collective wisdom to plan for this event, and also raise any issues that we can collectively brain storm and do some forward planning.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Lonelier on HRT?,"I thought I was pretty lonely before starting HRT. I spent months avoiding social situations because I had terrible social dysphoria that often forced me to leave social functions when I did attend. 

Anyway, I now find myself in the position where I really cannot stand being alone on weekends anymore. I have roommates, but they're a couple and we're all very different people. Maybe it's because I'm more in touch with my emotions now, but it's really bad today and I just want someone to sit and talk with. This repeats like every weekend. I don't know if it's because I'm actually lonelier, or that I've always been this lonely and never felt the full depth of it.

I found lots of studies etc. that were very helpful, but for some reason I can't find any kind of information showing data on gender identity organized by biological sex. So like ""percent of people who identify as gender queer who are biologically male"" vice versa. If anyone knows of any studies or census reports with this type of information that is reliable that would be much appreciated."
omg_violet,asktransgender,Is there a way to peacefully force my parents to support me?,"Honestly I don't even need acceptance, I just need support. And I need hormones. In the right light and at the right angle, I can kind of pass. But recently I've gotten darker and thicker facial hair, and my voice has gotten deeper and I've gotten a little bit taller. I know this subreddit preached ""Transition at any age!"" But I know now, and I'm certain and ready now. What's holding me back is solely my parents stubbornness and blindness. Is there a way to 'force' them to help? I don't want to be emancipated, as they do care about me and they want what's best for me, they just won't help with this. Also my dad makes a lot of money and I could afford to get into a really good game design school if I stay. But I don't want to stay as is, it's torture. I've cut myself in intense bouts of self hate, and I've tried to talk, but my dad thinks it's just a phase. There's zero chance this is a phase. I want them to help me, and I need them to help me, but they aren't.

I have trouble making friends/meeting people/presenting myself as someone people want to get to know so that alone leaves me feeling isolated. Before I began considering transition id met only a few trans people but they're all guys. While every trans guy I've met is a bad ass and I love them, im bummed that I've never even met another trans girl. It's maybe part of what took so long for me to see it in myself.

sarahtay98,asktransgender,Strange Question: How can I drop hints about my gender issues so it isn't a shock when I come out?,"I have very loving parents and I know I won't lose them when I come out. However they are conservative, and although they are very LBGT friendly and would probably not bat an eye if I came out as gay or anything like that, they're view of the transgender community has been largely defined by what they've heard on Fox News.(sigh) My political views are right in the middle but I'm very open about the fact that in far left on anything LGBT. I'll often talk about how transgender issues but I still think their view toward the trans community would have some conservative bias. My question here is this, how can I drop hints to my mom and dad that in trans. If they suspect I'm trans before I tell them, I think they will be a lot more accepting when I come out. Problem is, I've done a fantastic job hiding my true self for 18 years because I haven't even hinted at doing anything feminine, my voice is deep, and the majority of my friends are jocklike males. I know I'm already in a better position than a lot of you on here who have very religious parents but I just want to be able to come out and have my mom be ready to help me transition, rather than have me fearing they'll never see me as their daughter.

ITriedIPromise,asktransgender,My mother knows dysphoria is making me suicidal. Doesn't care at all.,"I finally got her and my dad to let me make an appointment with a therapist. That appointment was next Thursday. Today, she called and canceled it, without consulting me, because she didn't want me to ""go to someone who is paid to agree with me regardless of their real opinion."" Her counterproposal is that I go talk to our pastor. For obvious reasons, I declined. I was not as polite as I would like to pretend I was.

She asked me what I planned on accomplishing by transitioning, though she refuses to mention the word transgender or any other words that might come with it. Her actual wording was something like, ""What do you plan on accomplishing by doing 'things.'""

I told her that I didn't care about anything, and I wished I was dead. I'm at the point where if you took away the ability to transition, I'd just kill myself. Her response to this was, ""That will just make you want to kill yourself more.""

I don't know what to do. I think it's time to just leave and do things myself, but I have major anxiety and other problems, and I'm not at all financially stable. Talking to my father is not an option, all he ever does is manipulate my emotions and give false promises, only to go back on them later after my mother convinces him otherwise.

I'm so scared. I really do wish I was dead. I hardly know what to do, I don't have a job anymore (was a seasonal position, I expected to go back to school this fall, didn't happen), I don't have anything left. I'm never going to get help from my mother.

I want to move out, but the thought of getting an apartment, job, and everything else all by myself seems impossible. I know that sounds childish and stupid, but my anxiety is through the roof, and I can hardly manage to go to classes without freaking out, let alone try and tell my parents I'm leaving. They'll try to stop me if I do, I know it.

What am I supposed to do? I can't even sit down and speak my mind clearly, because anxiety. I tried writing down how I feel and giving to my father, but he doesn't seem to care, or it's beyond him to help me (which I wouldn't doubt, he has some pretty big mental problems himself).

Sorry for the ramble, I'm just scared and have no idea what to do next. I'm afraid that it's all in my head and I'd be making a huge mistake by trying to leave."

really-not_certain-,asktransgender,21 and questioning my identity. Do I count? (XY anatomy discussion and questions inside),"So, for as long as I can remember I've had on some level a thought that I'd rather be a girl than a boy. Sometimes this feeling gets more intense, then subsides for a while. Most of the time it's kind of a back burner thought, I've had other things to worry about. Then again, I've also had issues with acknowledging my feelings but that's a discussion for a different day. 

I've never been at a point of what I'd describe as dysphoria. I've no issues with my stock hardware, in fact I rather like it and would like to keep it around. 

Lately I've been feeling more intense desire to live as a woman rather than a man. I've been seriously considering transitioning for the first time in my life. I actually mentioned it to one of my close friends who is absolutely wonderful and she's been nothing but loving and caring. 

I don't know if my feelings are strong enough to justify transitioning. I don't feel out of place in my body, but I think I'd be happier with a woman's body. 

Calling back to one of my earlier points, I like having my penis. I hear stories of hormones making it difficult to get erections and reducing the intensity of them. Is there any way to mitigate that if I start hormones? My penis causes me no discomfort, though I don't really know how to explain why. Also, will hormones affect prostate orgasms at all? 

I'm fortunate enough to live in a very liberal city in the PNW, so I believe I'd be able to find a counselor in the area who could help me. Does anyone have advice on searching for one?

Sorry for the barrage of questions, there's been a lot on my mind about this lately. 

Thanks,

tennanbaum4040,asktransgender,"Strange line of thinking, please bear with me","Let me start by saying I've never experienced gender dysphoria. I am a transvestite, and the reality of my desires in life is to be able to pass as both genders easily. Unfortunately I am blessed (cursed) with a wide ribcage, wide shoulders, and not the most androgynous face in town. I understand there's makeup and there's different ways of dressing - I get that. 

What I want to know, or at least what I want to get some opinions on, is undergoing HRT to be able to do whatever I want. I probably won't change my gender on my license or anything, I just...want to be androgynous. Or at least, more androgynous that I am. 

I am currently in college, and I am twenty years old. Hopefully within several years I will have a stable career that will pay over $50,000 a year, if all goes according to plan. I am not willing to ""come out"" to my parents and family because I don't think it's that big of a deal - I just want the whole thing to be on the down low, not make a deal out of it. Therefore, it'll probably be roughly three to four years until I can safely start hormones/having surgeries or whatever. It will take me at least that long to find a place to live on my own. That means 23-24 years old.

Life is short, you know? It's the kind of thing where I'd like to say why the heck not, do it bruh, but I have so much time between now and then. I would honestly want to start hrt asap but I'm not going to fork the bills on my parents, not when its my thing and not theirs.

I've always found it odd that so many ftm folks needed to learn how to shave... I have no idea how, but I just know how to do it.

My family has been, at best, very cold to me about transition. My parents refuse to use my new name (which is unisex), and any protest is me asking to much of the family, and it makes them 'uncomfortable'.

So fast forward to last Friday, I fly out to bury my grandmother. Which I'm only doing for my mother, as grandma wanted nothing to do with me after I  came out years ago. At the wake I made it clear at the first hint I was NOT going to be a pallbearer. My parents have known i have a strong phobia of corpses. Next day, guess what? I'm a pallbearer, and when I try to protest my mother begs me. So trying to be there for the family and not make a scene I step up and do it.

So now though I realize this is the perfect way to turn the tables. If I had to be a pallbearer despite how uncomfortable it made me for family, the least they can do is use my new name.

Part of me thinks that this would be going to far, and just make me a jerk. What do y'all think? Going to be with the same crowd for Thanksgiving, and going a whole week of people suddenly using my old name...I'd rather skip what could be my grandpa's last birthday/Thanksgiving."

halfbakedrock,asktransgender,Resources for a young trans kid?,"Hi everyone!!

I'm a 22 year old genderqueer person. I'm very out and very happy to talk with cis people when they have questions, which where this is coming from essentially. 

Anywho. My manager recently came up to me and told me his child had come out to him and his wife about being transgender. He asked me to come over this week for dinner and to talk with his child if they wanted too. I agreed completely, and I'm happy that he and his wife are very accepting of their child. 

But what I'm looking for are some resources for young trans kids(the child is 12) that I can give them. I didn't really have any resources as a kid when I was coming out originally besides my GSTA advisor when I got to high school. I always was wondering if anyone had any resources I could give to my manager and his wife. 

Edit: We are located in Southern Maine in the United States!"
Minakio,asktransgender,"[Long vent] I'm so tired of those ""experts"".","I'm out to my family since July (and it went zeta-well, I'm very, very lucky to have this much support from my family), and see various so-called professionals since August in a (falling) hope to get HRT, or at least blockers in a first time. I didn't expect it to be so much mentally exhausting. 

I live in the Kingdom of France, and here's the catch: nobody has the slightest idea of how to proceed. If there's a clear, step-by-step way to get treated, they don't know it, as everyone does what they want. I went to a local LGBT group and got some names (two), that's it. They're not the only experts I saw, though.

The first one I saw was an endo. More knowledgeable about trans-related topics than the other ones I met up with. She wants me to see a psychiatrist during six months before she begins anything. Well ok, I never expected to have anything after the first appointment...

The second person I saw was a generalist. Well, he isn't a specialist, but he's supposed to be a doctor, and manages to fail at being a decent one. I saw him for strictly financial reasons, which would be to long to explain. Well anyway, he didn't want to admit that I could be sure of my identity (but hey, in France, they're TEACHED that their patients are imaginary invalids), won't treat me as a girl because, I quote, he's ""rationnal"", and that wasn't the worst. 

He was actually proudly violating medical privacy without even noticing, constantly talking about another patient of his, whom he referred to as ""a [deadname] who became a [name]"". Got on my nerves. So fucking much. Apparently we also saw him for nothing, because we (me and my mum, she went with me) apparently still don't have what we asked for...

The third is the best. On the slinding scale of ""fucking abusive moron"" vs ""respectful professional"", I mean. And he's the former.

Apparently, he had several trans patients. Makes me sorry for them. Well anyway, as an endo, he wanted a two-years-long therapy with two psychiatrists (and not before my majority, 'cause psychiatrists are ineffective on 17-years-old people). Wanted to wait 'till my structure is completely finished (even though he fucking knows that mine is way more advanced than it should for my age), I guess he thinks that girl's bones never grow. AND he also wanted the opinion of a surgeon he already chose (was he trying to get me a fucking SRS? Damn moron). This and ""we should wait for the puberty to end, and I never, oh God never ever saw you before for a precocious puberty that ended when you were 14. It's in the report, but we should wait"".

I tried to make my opinion known (in fact, the meting was mostly about me trying to correct his biggoted ways), but he never even tried to listen to me, claiming that he was the professional (read: so I should shut it). Well, it's not like I was researching about this subject for, like, five years. Oh shit, yes it is. Your fallacies are bad and you should feel bad.

Well anyway, when I went out of his office, I burst into tears, and that's from a girl who believed she was unable to cry. He was proud to annouce that this was the reason why he wanted to have multiple psychiatric reports. At least, he didn't try to sexually harass me...

To my french brothers and sisters, if you live around Caen, please avoid ""Eric Dupont"" at all costs. He's one of the worst things that could happen to you.

Fourth one is a psychiatrist I've seen for several years because it was necessary for allocations. Never trusted him. Didn't want to understand that me as a person wasn't changing, that was irratating... I tried to use him in order to bypass the six months the first endo wanted. Didn't work (he only wants to aknowledge the truth, so for honesty, I have to lie to the society if I don't want to look like a freak; you genius), absolutely wants me to have a two-years-long therapy with standard tests (RLE, I guess) starting from my majority. Thanks but no thanks.

Well, fifth one. He's a psychiatrist in the endocrinology section of my local hospital. Went well, actually thinks I suffer from gender dysphoria. He regularily meets up with his team (a sexologist and an endo) to discuss whether or not they should give treatment. They meet up by the end of November, so... If I'm lucky, I could begin to stop my T's rampage in a month and a half. Kind of saddens me to think that this is my best option right now. Told me to see his team as well. Meet him again next week.

Sixth one is the sexologist (don't know why, eeh I'm not a professional). Went... Well, I guess. No outright middle finger, that's nice. We didn't really talked about sexology, I guess it was just to meet me. Will see her again next week. Though her reports are all about ""he"".

Seventh (and last, I promise!) one. The endo. Weeeeell it didn't went as well as I hoped. First thing he noted was that I wasn't shaved. No sir, I don't want to engage in a typically masculine activity (no offense intended girls, here's a hug if you want one *hugs*) only to look like a shaved man. Talked about this for loooooooooooong and had a very hard time to understand. Communication is just hard with him, for me. He really wanted to se me as a boy. Seemed very, very cautious about my age, which I could understand if it had anything to do with maturity... Clearly said that I knew what I was talking about, I hope he understood this.

Perhaps the worst of this appointment was when he said that, with HRT, I intended to have the life of a normal 17-years-old boy, even though I made it very clear that my identity wasn't up to debate. I, of course, answered that I wanted the life of a normal 17 years-old girl. Tiring... See him again in a month. 

Anyway, having to convince them of what I already know in half a minute each IS stressful. 

And there's annoying common things, too. Like, always hearing ""you want to be a girl"" or ""you feel like you're a girl"", NO SIR, I AM. And quite happy to be one at that. If I punch you, I won't say bull like ""you feel like you're in pain"". You're in pain, end of the story (though I know some professionals that won't even believe that, I already heard that ""childen don't feel pain"").

And in the end, I've yet to be gendered correctly. :c

polymnia,asktransgender,Medicine/doctor problems,"Hi, figured I'd make a thread here again and see if there's possibly someone that can help me, but if not it's good just to kind of rant.

So I live in Norway and I chose not to use our official health care system to get whatever medicine I need. I've been using a private doctor instead, and while it's expensive, she's a lot more reasonable than whatever insane mess I'd be going through in the system. 

She's been good, but very cautious. Won't prescribe anything more than 200mg spiro and 4mg estradiol. Anyways, I've been on HRT for about 4 years now, and it's been kind of a difficult progress. Things were fine the first 1-2 year(s). Spiro stopped working and she wouldn't up the dosage, so she switched me to cyproterone, then off cyproterone because apparently she can't legally prescribe it. Meanwhile the estrogen I was taking started losing effect, so she ended up putting me on 1 and a half estradot patches twice a week, and 2 diane-35 pills a day. This worked great for a while, but after some months I started developing a pretty bad allergic reaction to the patches. She didn't want me on them or any equivalents so she took me off them, and now I'm only on 2 diane-35 pills a day. 

I know she's a doctor and everything, but I don't feel great about it. She claims it's enough, but there is no way to prove it yet. The lab I've been getting my blood tested at can't detect ethinyl estradiol (the type of estrogen in the diane-35 tablets), so we have no way of telling how much estrogen is in my blood. I've been trying to get her to find a lab that can test for ethinyl estradiol for a couple of weeks now, but she is taking her time. 



On the chance that this all goes tits up and she won't/can't prescribe something else, what are my options? I bet someone from Norway could answer this best, but I'm happy with all the input I can get. I guess there's self medding? Which would be a nightmare with our customs, though. Expensive and incredibly unreliable. I could maybe switch doctors, but finding someone who is willing to actually treat transgender people is very difficult :( If anyone knows anything I'd be happy!


Also, is there anyone here with maybe an education in medicine or something like that, that could give me a second opinion on whether 2 diane-35 tablets (Cyproterone acetate 2mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.035mg per tablet) could possibly be enough for HRT? Seems to do just fine surpressing my T, but estrogen I have no idea about"
GabiCap,asktransgender,"Getting eyebrows waxed, what do I say?","I have so much hair especially my eyebrows. I'm planning on going today to get them waxed, mostly the hair between the brows, but I figure why not shape them a little more feminine and like a girl to see how it is (baby steps).

Thing is what do I say/ ask for before they wax so that I grt the shape I want.

nau_,asktransgender,Anyone else notice change in tastes in food on HRT?,I've just noticed I go for sour and spicy things way more.

Maypell,asktransgender,I don't like my body,"I'm almost 14 and I know that i'm maybe too young for this but I can't stand looking at my body when i'm undressed. I know I'm not trans because I do feel like a female most of the time but when i'm undressed I can't look at myself without feeling like this is not what I want to see, but when I'm dressed even in pretty tight shirts I'm ok with myself... 
My family isn't religious they're really open and supportive and no one ever made me feel ashamed of my body (I never thought I was fat or anything) 
I also hate thinking about all the period and pregnancy, when girls talk about It's like I understand what is the ""magical"" part of this but I don't get it. 
I know there's a chance that i'm thinking about my gender and all of that because lately i was kinda actually introduced into that world honestly.. i don't know...
Most of the time dress in a pretty tomboy-ish way but I still wear dresses and skirts and put on make up for fun sometime or when we're going out. I kinda feel like i'm a mix up between female and agender although... But I really don't know what I am because when I'm naked I can barely look at myself in the mirror but with clothes I almost don't mind it...
So if anyone is willing to help me understand myself I'd like that..."
ProbablyAmyy,asktransgender,Isn't this all backwards...?,"So I had another counseling session, and I was told that I could start hormones and voice therapy and stuff ... after being full time for 3 months and changing my name legally.

Doesn't that seem backward? Aren't those sort of treatments those that you take before you go full time? They seem that way to me.

I get why they have those parameters. To ensure people don't make a mistake or misread their feelings, but really, for me they asking me to go full time in a physical state I wouldn't be comfortable in. Like they are asking me to be -extra- uncomfortable for 3 months, before they'll start processes to make me feel better about myself?

To be fair the counselor agreed that the system can seem broken at times - But that I'll have to jump through the hoops. But the hoops seem more like cookie cutters. That to get help, I need to a very specific 'mold' of trans. And they'll jam me through the cookie cutter before they'll help me.

Standard practice or not, does that seem backward to anyone else?

EDIT - I'm in the UK for the record! People asked :)"
CoffeeAndSconed,asktransgender,I feel lost. How do I move forward?,"[Lot of back story, please bear with me.] 

So last year, actually about this time, I had the revelation that I was transgender. Since I'm in college and don't have a good relationship with my parents I told only a few close friends and a councilor that I had been seeing for a few months. Towards the end of January I ended up starting hormones and blockers. This lasted about two weeks at max before my parents found out. I basically was forced to stop (under penalty of financial problems as they cosign loans) and our relationship deteriorated. 

I worked at putting myself in denial for the rest of the semester and had more or less achieved my goal by the beginning of May. Towards the end of this time I started dating and quickly started a relationship with a girl. Over the summer we really hit it off. Spending almost all of our free time together we were damn near inseparable and we have completely fallen for each other. During the summer, early July, I told her of my thoughts of sometimes wanting to be a girl and how I thought I might be transgender after a week of intense thoughts. She took it really hard and we almost broke up but did not. After that things went really well and the summer ended on a high note.

Now we get to school and this week. So I am fairly sure that I am transgender. I find myself envious of girls looks, makeup, clothes, and basically anything associated with being a girl. Physical, mental, or otherwise. This week though I have had these thoughts more intensely than any time in the previous 6 months and after a week of hiding them I told her whats going on. She has been really hurt and this past weekend has been incredibly rocky. If one of us is not crying the other is. 

Out of our relationship, after the second month, we have been incredibly serious (even though we are in college). This re-coming of the thoughts has been hard for her and she feels like she will lose me if I transition as she can't really see herself with a girl (I don't hold this against her and don't want to demonize her) for the rest of her life.

And now comes my plea for help. I don't know what to do. I want to stay with her so bad and I wish so bad that I didn't have a feeling of being in the wrong body or cohort. I want to marry her so badly and I don't want to rip apart her life. But on the other hand I have this burning desire to change. I want to be a girl so badly. I hate my face, my nose, forehead, and jaw. Ugh. But if I change I'll lose my parents, her, and I'm just terrified about affording to live if I change. I feel as if I have two different people and their wants inside me and I'm trying so hard to just not lose it.

Tl;DR - A lot of you have gone through similar and I want to pull on your wisdom to help move forward. I'm so scared of losing what I have and hurting those closest to me while dually feeling a pressure to change. Any advice would be tremendously appreciated!!!

Thank you!
Cheers.

PavementBlues,asktransgender,"I'm currently full-time, but with very few physical changes from HRT. How should I dress when interviewing for a new job?","My plan before was to not go full-time until much later in transition, allowing me to interview in guymode and bring up my gender transition when they asked if I had any questions. Then, I would start the job presenting as male and make the switch when it felt right.

Full-time happened a lot earlier than planned, though (sort of by accident - it felt like a pain wearing guy clothes out and so I just stopped and never went back), so now I'll be interviewing with a feminine haircut and nails, along with waxed eyebrows.

I seem to be between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it will look weird if I go in a suit. On the other hand, I've seen virtually no physical changes from HRT yet and seeing someone who looks like they're cross-dressing for a job interview could be off-putting for initial impressions (I'm not saying that it should be that way, but I've found that it can make even allies uncomfortable if they haven't been exposed to it before).

The good news is that I moved to a very accepting city, so I don't expect there to be much serious transphobia. I'm just not sure how to approach this and look professional. Any ideas?"

Emily656,asktransgender,How many therapy sessions?,"I am a 60 year old MTF transwoman who has been on HRT for over 2 years and have recently decided to pursue GCS. I have been seeing a therapist who uses terms like ""gatekeeper"" to describe himself, who sits facing me with his legs splayed and both hands on his crotch while asking me questions about whether my breasts have been surgically augmented (even though I have never mentioned my breasts or breast augmentation) and repeatedly reminding me that nothing is going to happen with any letter of referral until he is satisfied that he has ""crossed every t and dotted every i"". Prior to this we have talked about my history from childhood to current, that I am out full time, that my employer is aware and supportive, that I have no underlying medical or psych issues, that I have a support network of family and friends, and that I serve on a LGBTQ advisory committee at work. Every time I think we are close to ending he closes the session by instructing me to schedule another appointment (we are already at 8). It seems to me that he is just running up billable hours or has some issues of his own and that I should look for another therapist. Thoughts?"
tumemanques24,asktransgender,"Update, questions about therapy, questions about sex, and hormones.","So my husband told me a little over a month ago that he might be a woman. He since has been to therapy. He realizes that he doesn't want to be a woman, but he also doesn't want to be a man. What this means, is still beyond me. I hope in time he can figure it out. 

We both are in therapy. My therapist thinks he should be put back on testosterone because he has a condition that makes his T low. He only feels trans when he's not on T. His therapist hasn't even gotten to talking about the gender stuff yet. Have any MtF been on testosterone before? If you have, did you not feel trans when on it?

Now, the big problem... sex. When I was younger, I was raped. It took me a long time to get over and my husband was the first person I slept with after. However, somewhere along the line I developed a submissive fetish. I like pleasing my partner by doing what they say and I typically like the people I'm with to be dominant in the bedroom. My husband learned to like being dominant in the bedroom and our sex life, although infrequent, is good.

Until last weekend. Last weekend was the first weekend I went out with my husband while he was dressed as a girl. We both had a lot of fun picking out an outfit and doing make-up for a concert we were going to. We both agreed that we wouldn't try having sex with his female self until I felt comfortable, which I wasn't yet.... until I got drunk at the concert. 

We were both dancing and shaking our hips and singing and she just looked so amazingly free and happy just to be there so I kissed her. One thing lead to another and we were home and under the sheets. I did something very uncharacteristic of me and became a little demanding. I would ask her to do something and she'd do it and I'd pleasure her through nipple play. We both had a good time then passed out.

The next morning with make-up all over our faces she turned to me and told me it was the best sex she has ever had. And I was so happy for her. But being dominant all the time is the opposite of what I like. And now our sex sucks. She has a hard time holding an erection and can only seem to get off if I'm playing with her nipples... but I don't want to do this every single time. She says she doesn't know why or if she can't get off without it.... it's all just screwed up. We used to both be able to get off and now it seems like it's only one of us.... it sucks. I miss sex where both parties leave happy. Has this happened to people after beginning the transition, pre-everything? How do we overcome this? I feel like people shouldn't NEED one certain thing to happen to get off... especially if they didn't need it before. Are there any trans people on testosterone that are male and want to be women?

Thanks for listening."
Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Tips for stimulating eyebrow hair growth?,"My eyebrows sit a little too low on my face and don't arch to an extent I'm happy with. I also have a little bit of thinness (though it isn't terrible) from years of not very good tweezing technique and some waxing, so I was wondering whether any people here have any experience with stimulating brow growth higher on the brow.

I've read that a little strategic plucking on the underside **may** stimulate growth up top, and of course I'd heard both of Revitabrow and off-label use of Men's Rogaine to encourage hair growth (though the risks of getting Rogaine into your eyes sound scary). Does anyone here have experience with something that works, and is the solution temporary or permanent?"

EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Suicidal thoughts getting worse,"Please before read before commenting, I don't actually want to kill myself and I don't have any plans to but thoughts of doing it are increasing. Also I'm on a waiting list for a counsellor so until they get back to me talking to one isn't an option.

This isn't completely trans related but suicide is slowly coming to be the only way I see my life ending, I feel like I will end up committing suicide at some point but I really don't want to. Here are the main reasons why:

1) I feel like no matter what happens with transition I will have missed most of my youth (I'm 18 almost 19 now) hating myself due to only realising I was trans about a year ago, having started hormones about 5 months ago and being unable to comfortably go 'full time' for probably a year. 

2) Within my group of friends, which is weird in the way it works, I am only really close to 2 of them and slightly close with another 2, with the rest only being friends by association. I feel uncomfortable around quite a few of them but because group events I frequently hang out with them. The group often feels very upset with people when they do something and don't invite everyone (i.e. If I had a day out with the 2 I'm close to everyone else would probably be upset they weren't invited) although it's getting better.

3) The majority of my friends are on a gap year and looking to go to uni next year. I don't want to go to uni and study again and am looking to do an apprenticeship for software development (would love to work making games or in esports). When next year comes I feel like I'm going to feel very lonely as they'll all go and make new friends and I'll be left on my own. One of my closest friends is studying in the city we live however my parents are looking to move about a half hour away and I don't think anyone will come and visit (except the 2 closest friends but even then idk). I'm very afraid of being alone, so many people in my family are lonely (don't have many friends and are unhappy about it) and I don't want to end up the same.

4) To add on to the lonely feeling, I've only kind of had a relationship but it wasn't very long and nothing really happened but I only met her through school like my friends. Now I'm no longer going to go to school I have no idea how I'm going to meet any new friends or people to date (especially because I'm closeted and don't really have an eta on when I'd come out fully it's not really fair to get into a relationship knowing this.) and the fact I feel like I don't have many meaningful friends and that I don't have a partner and with the majority of people I'm in contact with will be leaving/I'll be leaving I feel like I'm going to end up really lonely.

5) I don't really feel motivated to do anything with life. I feel like I lost so much of my youth being depressed and not knowing why I hated myself I never got into sports/skills/clubs and I feel like I missed out so much. I kinda wanna play sports but my anxiety is a lot worse and the idea of changing and playing alongside loads of men makes me feel very uncomfortable. Also because I wouldn't have been playing sports since I was young there is no way I'm gonna be really good/great at it and if I'm not going to be anywhere near the best what's the point? I'm pretty good at league of legends and it'd be my dream to be a pro but I'm nowhere near good enough. Even if I was I doubt I'd be able to cope mentally. I also don't think I'd be able to practice enough to get there.

Adding this all up, if I'm going to end up being more lonely and isolated, still unmotivated to do anything meaningful and maybe having missed the boat on being one of the best at something it feels like suicide is inevitable? Please help me I really want to be better, less lonely and feel like I can actually achieve my dreams even though I probably won't.

ceciliamemorbilia,asktransgender,Has any one else become less dysphoric about their bottom half the farther along you go in transition,"Has this happened too anyone else? Before when I first started transitioning just the thought of my bottom parts would turn me into a psychotic depressed crazy bitch and now after like a year+ transition I'm kind of getting to this point where it's more of an inconviencce when it comes to trying to make cute shorts work or swimwear and it's kind of just like ""wtf this is weird what are you doing that??"" Even in like a sexual context I feel I've got to the point that it doesn't bother me and is just a unique aspect about myself 

I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with this but I've kinda reached this point of realization and liberation that I don't have to be what society expect me to be to be a girl like ""to be a girl you have to be x, y, and z"". It's like I've come to the realizeation that yea I'm not cis so I shouldn't try to pretend that I am cis and i can finally say that I don't have to be all those things to be a girl. And it's not like I pass 100% of the time I still get dead named from time to time and misgender but that's ok because I know who I am (gender identity wise) and I'm comfortable with being different. Idk it's just like I've been slowly working closer and closer to this point my whole transition and it's getting to the point where it's like yea sure I have ""flaws"" according to society that I can't change (like every girl out there) and that I can finally after 21 years of living just be myself and not be definitely by what's in my pants and just be me.

Sorry if i ranted to much I drifted a bit away from the question though the subject matter is why I've reached this conclusion. 

I guess what I'm getting at is has anyone else experienced this same thing during transition and become comfortable with their current parts the more and more you transition. Or maybe you've grown more comfortable with them for maybe a different reason or even if it's gotten worse the more you've transitioned.

PM_ME_ORIENTAL_PUSSY,asktransgender,Verifying someone's transgender status,"After some research I've become interested in creating a dating site that caters exclusively for the transgender community, and completely excluding cis folk from joining. I can understand why transgender people would want a resource like this, rather than joining a generic site and being bombarded with requests from cis folk. With the background I have in web development I feel like I could accomplish this however I have one major question:

In what ways would you feel comfortable verifying your trans status? I feel that not everyone in the community would have medical evidence e.g. those who transition by themselves and ordering hormones online. Also how comfortable would people feel providing redacted doctors letters and potentially official I.d.? I'm having a hard time thinking how to balance verification as strict can rule out cis but means that there may be many who feel uncomfortable providing such evidence or are unable to do so, but too relaxed means it could be open to abuse allowing cis folk to join.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted some feedback before embarking on such a venture."

My day-to-day wardrobe (which is still depressingly male) doesn't lend itself well to hiding changes and I only have a couple outfits of girl clothes that would be considered everyday wear. In about a year, I'll be doing an internship where I'll have to dress professionally and, if I've already been on hormones for a year, male professional dress is definitely not good for hiding that.

RandomPlumm,asktransgender,Why is our community full of so many conflicting opinions?,"So recently I've been seeing lots of arguments by trans people where they are arguing over things such as gender is a social construct, it's biological, two genders, infinite genders, gender is based on sex, sex is irrelevant, sex is a construct, you can chose your gender, non binary/agender exists, non binary/agender doesn't exist etc etc etc. 

There's a thread currently where people are arguing about it and I recently seen it in a video by JacklynGlenn on YouTube called 'TWO GENDERS'. In the video she and another girl basically say how they don't believe in non binary/agender identities. Then I read the comments and it's just a shit show with so many different opinions and people invalidating each other.

Seriously what the fuck. It seems like our own community doesn't even have a clue how to answer questions about itself. How can we get mad at people when they get confused when we can't even agree on things ourselves. Trans people invalidating other trans people because we can't agree about who is or isn't trans. Why do we have so many conflicting opinions? We can't all be right because we are disagreeing on really fundamental things about being trans.  

I'm starting to really hate being a part of the trans community because of all this bullshit. I just want to know why is it becoming like this? I'm starting to feel like it's because we include too many groups under the 'transgender' umbrella or whatever. I've started to only refer to myself as transsexual because transgender can mean so many different things. I don't know for sure if that is why but seems to be what I'm leaning towards.

So I came out to my parents when I lived on my own, I was eighteen. I didn't wanna hurt them and cut them out of my life entirely, so when they disagreed with my decision to transition and my request to use the correct pronouns and name, I let it be. We still argued about it though, about once a month-ish.

Then, I moved into my car before my nineteenth birthday, and just... cut contact with them. The arguing and deadnaming were really starting to mess with me. A few months pass, and I decide to give them one last chance. I go over for dinner and tell them I plan to leave for California. We argue, and I leave.

My car broke in a parking lot not five minutes away. I call them the next morning, they come get my and my biological dad tows my car home. He knows a guy, and I stay with them while said guy fixes it.

I stat with them a bit longer, but their constant deadnaming and misgendering gets to me, so I move in with a friend for a few months, then back into my car for another two months. I then move to Tenessee from Texas, to live with my boyfriend, and have been here a month.

We haven't talked in five or so months.

My biological mom contacted me today. Tells me they miss me, says they'll always love me.

Yoshikaka,asktransgender,First time dating a transwoman. Questions!,"I've been on a couple of dates with a trans woman, and although she's been very forthcoming with my stupid questions I feel like there are some things that I can't bring myself to ask her.

She is totally gorgeous and has just begun transitioning, so she's on female hormones but still hasn't had gender confirmation surgery. I'm totally drawn to her and she has given me numerous hints that she wants to have sex soon. I'm totally cool with her as she is right now and I'm not waiting for her to have gender confirmation surgery or anything like that.

The thing is that she resents having a penis and doesn't seem to want to use it for sex or stimulation before the surgery because receiving oral sex or a hand job makes her feel masculine. For me sex is very much about pleasuring my partner, so that's a hard one for me. Right now it seems like she only wants to have anal sex, which I've never done before, but am willing to try. I just feel like sex right now would be very much about trying to ignore her genitals when in fact I'm actually curious and turned on by her. 

I guess my logic is telling me that if I'm open to try and make her orgasm without feeling like I'm compromising with my sexuality (I identify myself as 110% straight) then it shouldn't really be an act of masculinity for her either, but rather just us both stepping out of our comfort zones. I do of course realise that it's not that simple, and I don't want her to do anything that she's not comfortable with. 

How can I bring this up without making her feel like I'm pressuring her into something? I will of course respect her decision, but I would at least like to have an open dialogue about it, even though we haven't known each other very long."
gelbkatze,asktransgender,[Legal Advice] Changing my first name in Massachusetts as part of transgender transition. Advice needed for drafting an affidavit waving my counties requirement for name changes to be published in local paper.,"Hey! I am currently in the process of changing my name, which as part of the guidelines put forth by my counties court, requires publishing the change of name in a local newspaper. The court states that this requirement can be waived and as this would put me in an precarious situation with both extended family and members of my community; I am trying to create an affidavit to waive this requirement.

I posted below an overview of the reasons why I am seeking this wavier, but I would be grateful of any advice on what I should include in terms of content and in how this should be formatted. I sincerely appreciate any help!

1.	There is a real and substantial threat of both discrimination and physical abuse to those who appear as or who are known as being transgender. 

2.	The presence of both my extended and immediate family near my current place of residence would cause undue strife to those members who do not as of yet know of my transition for reasons stemming from safety and family strife. In particular, my grandmother who being in a fragile medical state, risks unjust harm from public acknowledgement of this name change. 

3.	My father, who’s name I currently share, could also be adversely affected by a public announcement as result of being mistaken for myself

4.	As a member of a family with a long standing presence in the town which I currently reside. Public notice of my change of name would put me at greater risk to both physical harm and discrimination from members of my community while complicating delicate relationships within my overall family.

I was googling beautiful transgender girls and looking up the super models or actresses and then I was curious at what age they transitioned and I found that all the ones I thought were beautiful transitioned at like 14... I'm 24, so then I felt sooooooo depressed.

Then I started being logical and realizing that the only reason I find those people having all a super low age of transition is not because if you transition later you won't be beautiful, but that, you wont have a successful modeling career because most models and actresses get in by 17-19 so then ones that transition later can still be so beautiful but just not known. They're living much less celeb lives. So I made myself feel better a little. But just as some role models, could you guys give me some hope by sending me names of beautiful transgender girls that transitioned after puberty? Like 18 and up? I would love that so much because I really need some hope right now and fuck progestrone for making me so moody and depressed.

Edit: I'm off to bed super depressed trying to watch a movie and forget. I would love some responses in the morning. I love you all so much and I'm so happy this community exists. I wish I didn't need you so much, but I really do. Thank you for being with me."

I know Lavarne Cox is popular too (queen Lavarne live on) but both of them aren't quite role models for me; and I figure a decent amount of people?

I suppose my main problem is that the media always uses Jenner as a spokesperson for the trans community, but she isn't like a lot of trans people. She has had like 3-4 kids? Is in her 60s? Has been married twice I think? Point is, she's out-of-date and very unrelated to quite a few trans people. 

Why can't we have younger trans models or actors as a public figurehead? One girl I look up to more than anything is Michelle Hendley. She played in the movie ""Boy meets girl"" but hasn't been in much other than that. Why aren't more young trans people??????

When my parents first heard my coming out, they always cited Jenner. A few of my friends parents did to. So automatically they assume that I'm going to mess up my life???

helllo_there,asktransgender,Hormone dosage sanity check.,"Hello there, that's another thread about hormone levels, I know they are boring and repetitive but please give your input if you think this scenario is normal. The TL;DR should summarize the important info.

&amp;nbsp;

I started HRT almost 3 months ago. I'm getting my prescriptions with a gynaecologist, she's the only known physician on public healthcare to help trans people in my city. I like her, she answers all my questions and is very accepting.

The problem is my dosages. She prescribed contraceptives to me, each pill contains 0,035mg ethinylestradiol and 2mg cyproterone acetate. I used to take 2 of them daily but yesterday she said I can use 4. So my current dosages are:

- 0,140mg ethinylestradiol

- 8mg cyproterone acetate

- 1mg finasteride (I use this by DIY but she knows it)

I take half the dosage in the morning and the other half 12 hours later.

&amp;nbsp;

She told me that they are already very high and the normal should be only 2 pills daily, instead of the current 4. Also said that 6 months from now I should go back to 2 pills and stop finasteride, I'm using 4 just to put my mind at ease and my body will just eliminate the excess.

Based on what I read around here these numbers seem very small. Don't they?

&amp;nbsp;

What about my levels? I've only been tested for total testosterone at 2 months HRT, blood test, 11-13 hours after taking 1 pill. The result was 52ng/dL and men range from 160 to 816 ng/dL and women from 0 to 73 ng/dL. No estrogen tests yet, only 5 months from now.

I really feel these effects of HRT:

- No erections, sensitivity is very different and ejaculation is almost gone

- Reduced muscle mass, triceps are gone, and strength, can't lift things

- Body hair is growing slower

- Emotions are stronger, crushing loneliness. Better than no emotions though

- Skin is kind of different

- Little breast growth, but they are sensitive and I come from a very small family in this regard

So, should I worry about the dosages and seek the private health care endocrinologists? Or everything seems normal? I think I'm obsessing about this, very worried about low dosages.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: Hormone dosages seem very low, should I worry? Dosage and perceived changes and are highlighted.**

assassin216,asktransgender,Questioning everything...,"Quick lowdown on me. And excuse me if I ramble a bit. I'm 31, biologically female and bisexual. I was quite the tomboy growing up, typically wore men's clothing, and was so damn exclusionary to all boys to the point of people straight up asking me if I was a lesbian (to clarify, I've never been with a woman, because I never had the courage to ask my girl crush, but I sure af fantasised about it).
I got here because I'm in the middle of writing a fantasy novel where one of my characters is a trans man (he's a minor character at the moment, but I intended to use his pov for a short story where his home is attacked, because he's one of a handful that escape) and I was basically researching because I want to be as accurate as I can.

But I stopped thinking about that after the fourth or fifth ftm thread and... Well, little points keep striking something in me and... Well, I'm not sure of anything anymore. What I do know is that there are times where I feel super feminine and love the hell out of my slightly chubby 4'11 self, whilst other times I feel like parts of me don't belong there. Specifically my breasts. I go through patches of ""hell yeah bitches, these are mine!"" to ""why the heck are these here?"".
I can distinctly recall just wanting to remove them a number of times, those thoughts are generally wrapped up in my dark days. I'd rather not mention too much about the level of penis envy I can have, that goes back further than the breast issue. I've no great desire to transition (I'm not even sure of the full process in my country, but I know it's a ridiculously long wait, like 50 years or some BS without going private), but if I had three wishes, having a penis would be #1. I really wouldn't miss my vagina, although my partner of 13 years might.
And then there's the sex... My partner is my first... everything, so I've not really explored much sexually, but I do know that like maybe 80% of the time, I'll only reach orgasm by imagining myself as a man and, when my partner's involved, it often becomes a tricky game of me concentrating on his perspective.

In all, I wonder if I'm perhaps genderfluid.

These are my thoughts and I guess I'm kind of hoping that something sounds familiar and be able to tell me wtf is going on because 'in confidence' talks here still turn into a whole family discussion (the joy of living with extended family)."

When I hear about some people that were sure about their dysphoria ever since they were little and would dress up, and play with girls toys and other things and when I compare it to myself I feel like the reason I want to be a girl it's superficial/silly(?), I wanna be a girl because I want to feel cute, I wanna use make up, wear girls clothes, have long hair, etc.

misscharlotteG,asktransgender,"Do you feel that there was one event that ""activated"" the trans in you?","Like one event that started it all, made you question, etc.

For me it was when I was like 11 and home alone and tried on my sister's clothes. I often wonder where I would be if a family member was home that day and I didn't try them on. Would I be where I am now? Would I have ever realized that transitioning was something that I could actually do? Weird to think about."
deannamaybe,asktransgender,Social transition at work: how?,"I'm in a fairly key role at the company I work for. I was good at what I did, and took on more responsibility, helped develop processes and eventually took over the department. As a result, I manage a small team, and because I've earned a reputation as a problem solver, I have become a go to person for both people within and outside of the company. 

I'm an introvert by nature but have become comfortable being very social within the office, although I still find it very awkward and uncomfortable being put on the spot. I'm not ready for it yet, but being out at work and social transition at work scares the hell out of me. How do I do it. How do I suddenly go from being the go to guy to the go to girl. How do I handle the confused callers or emails looking for me, my name, email and number on literally thousands of projects I've worked on. Explaining this to my team is going to be challenging enough but how do I handle everyone else (inside and outside the company)? How does one transition so publicly?

The idea of finding another job isn't really feasible. I love my job, most of the people, the company, my boss. I make great money and benefits are good. As my job is so specific, finding something in the industry at a similar salary would be a challenge. Beyond that, I don't really like the idea of running from my fears."
AndroAidan,asktransgender,I'm thinking about telling my Dad.,"Lately, my dysphoria has been getting exponentially worse. I remember looking in the mirror the other night at my face and my hips and my thighs and my everything and just started crying my eyes out.

I feel stuck. I feel like I'm running out of time. I want to do something about it, but there isn't much to do. Even if I do get started with the process of transitioning, it could take months before I get a prescription for testosterone.

I'm thinking about telling my Dad. If I do decide that I'm ready to start transitioning on a higher level, I'll need parental consent. I'm 98.5% that my Dad would be okay with me transitioning. In fact, I feel as if he already suspects that there is something going on.

My Dad has always been extremely supportive of me and I know that he would love me no matter what. But there is a difference between accepting someone for who they are, and letting them BE who they are. Even if he does accept and support me, I'd understand his concern as a parent in letting your child change themselves, literally.

I'm pretty young, so he would probably say something along the lines of, ""Your too young to know what you want"" or, ""Maybe this is just a phase your going through"" or something like that.

I don't know, I'm just so depressed and scared and I feel like everything is going against me and if I do tell my Dad, there is a possibility that he might go against me as well. And that's the scariest thing of all. He really is the only person in my life that I trust."
confusedteach,asktransgender,I'm a pre-school/young years teacher with two possibly trans students - how to approach?,"I have two students (one 6ish, one 9ish) at separate schools, who both appeared to me initially to be physically female, but have male names. I began to get confused when other children began referring to them as he/him (English isn't a native language to these children and so initially I assumed they were making a mistake). Then I met one of the children's mother at the end of the lesson and she too referred to the child as 'he'. OK, I thought, case closed! I'll make sure not to put my foot in it and just address the kids either by he/him or their name.

THEN one of the children began asking me that I don't call him by the male version of his name, but by a new, more feminine-sounding nickname. The other children were all confused by this and seemed really reluctant to speak at all in case they got it wrong. I have a feeling that perhaps they've been spoken to by the school in order to check that everyone is on the same page regarding pronouns, but now are a bit nervous in case they get it wrong as there's a hush that falls over the room sometimes when they need to speak to the child in question. It shouldn't matter to my teaching at all, but I find myself wondering constantly and would just like to ask to make sure I'm on the same page. The problem is that it seems a very tricky question to ask a parent of such a young child, not to mention the child themself. 

I teach at multiple schools, and so have no access to the usual information surrounding the children (e.g. registered sex, learning difficulties, family situation, etc.). I'm also so late in the day that I rarely get chance to grab one of their usual teachers to discuss anything.

I get that there isn't really a problem here to address outside of my difficult-to-suppress urge to categorise all the children in my class, I do. But I guess I'd just like any advice/ideas/opinions on this situation. I feel like I'm kept in the dark slightly and it's making me second guess all my lessons."

For the most part people just didn't care. Those that did notice would say things ranging from nice to down-right wrong. People would call me fag, gay bitch with a penis and all sorts of names. Some even calling me racist slurs such as N-word Faggot and saying I should kill myself. I shrug most of this off because well its just a game any the people saying it are the ones I'm usually beating in the game �� but it def starts getting to me after while.

nocew,asktransgender,Crashing Down. Desperate for Help. (MtF in Texas),"Hey, so some might remember me from a few posts I made here this month. I thought I could start transitioning on my own. I had booked an appointment with the closest therapist I could find. The meeting went fine and I did get a lot of my emotions out but my therapist found me still too emotionally and financially unstable to transition. However, I can't wait anymore. I've been wanting this for 10 years at least, and living away from my abusive parents I would like to start my transition finally. I mention this because I can't afford any more visits to that therapist. The insurance I currently have doesn't cover any of the cost, even though the place accepts the insurance? It's weird.. And I'm not entirely sure how these things work since I've only been living in the USA for 2 months. The visit anyway ended up being $150 which is over half of my current savings, and I don't have a job yet. I'm at a very desperate time in my life, and I wanted to know if anyone here is from Texas and if they can direct me to any informed consent clinics and how much it would cost so I can get on hormones as soon as possible. I'm currently in the horrid Texoma region, so any resources around that area, if any would be a big help. I don't have any means of transportation here but my friend might be able to give me a ride if it's not too far off. If there aren't any informed consent clinics near, then a cheap therapist could possibly do. Just anything that can get me hormones that isn't crazy expensive. "

TheBatIsBack,asktransgender,"Theory on why some people are ""scared"" of us.","I just read an article in my cities news paper (yeah the actual paper) about the growing clown problem of 2016 (seriously what is it about this year that's making it so bizarre?)

They go on and take quote from a social psychologist (Frank McAndrew) being interviewed by National Geographic: ""In many ways, clowns combine a perfect storm of freaky things,"" [...] ""If a person is willing to flout the conventions of society by dressing and acting as they do, what other rules might they break?""

Now I'm not trying to compare us to clowns exactly, but the majority of society sees us breaking the mold of what's considered ""acceptable"" for how we're ""supposed"" to act and what we're ""supposed"" to wear according to the sex we're assigned at birth.

 Essentially I think that's why we've scared them. In the back of their minds they think we're all just waiting to see what rule we'll break next, as evidenced by this bathroom bill in North Carolina.

Do you guys agree or think I'm just full of shit?"

**TW for transphobic slurs, even though I censored them.**

Anyway, I just got back from the local supermarket, and I bumped into three people who I used to know prior to transition. One of them had been kind of ok, the other two had physically bullied me throughout secondary school. I haven't seen any of them since I left home two year ago, thank god.

The ok one (we'll call him L) recognised me, he must have heard about the fact that I was transitioning from someone, probably social media, he was with one of the awful ones. L said hi, it was awkward and I wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of there, and he said some weird ignorant stuff like ""blah blah brave, blah blah lifestyle, blah blah I always knew you were a gay."" The other one, S, didn't say anything, just kind of looked me up and down at first and turned away looking disgusted. He laughed when L asked me my name and I said it was Julia.

So I said I was in a hurry and walked on, but my way was blocked by another guy. I didn't quite recognise him at first, his face had changed quite a bit and he'd put on a lot of weight. The other one of the not-ok guys, H.

He started to say he was sorry about how he'd treated me, but frankly I don't care if he is sorry or he isn't. Idgaf if he meant any of it or if he was just trolling. I don't care why he did it, I don't care if he feels guilty, he can fuck off and die as far as I'm concerned because he was the worst person I've ever had to deal with. So I said nothing, I stepped around him and walked quickly away.

As I was walking away the second guy shouted loudly ""Hey everybody look at that t\*\*\*\*y f\*\*\*\*t isn't it disgusting. The s\*\*-\*\*\*e's name is [deadname]. Fucking l\*\*\*\*\*y!""

Big supermarket, kind of busy at the time, so I guess no security heard or cared. Most people nearby just walked away, not wanting to get involved. I kept walking, paid for what I'd got and came home.

I feel like I want to cry, but I can't. I feel totally alone. I feel like I'll never be rid of them, or people like them. I feel exactly how I felt before I left home, it's just pulled it all right back, all this fucking shit I thought I'd got over. I thought I dealt with.

Ramble over, I've run out of things to say. I'mma go watch Lord of the Rings and cry or something."
Magic_Made_to_Order,asktransgender,Is Reddit getting better?,"These last few months, since summer really, I've noticed something.

Like a lot of people I have two accounts - one for trans stuff and one for everything else.

Now, with either account I never go to the horrible parts of Reddit (you know the parts I mean) but... Well, with my other account I read and post in various non political and non gender-related subs. Things for my hobbies, my work, you know the sort of places.

and recently trans-related subjects have been coming up far more than they ever used to and... people are overwhelmingly supportive.

It's cool and honestly quite surprising in some of those subs, which you'd think would skew to the transphobic end of the population.

Has anyone else noticed this? I am certain the deliberately hateful subs are still as evil as ever, but has anyone noticed an uptick in talking about trans people and support for us in 'random' subs?"

DevNull1415,asktransgender,"MtF Pre-HRT Pic, Seeking Opinions About Realistic HRT Results","Without going into too much detail, I was recently involved in a somewhat short-lived relationship online with a lesbian cis female who ended up dumping me because I was not ""feminine enough"" for her tastes after seeing me.  She had never been with someone trans before and initially said she could deal with it, but male sexuality intimidates her and sadly she couldn't look past the ""male"" element of me being AMAB.  I respect her preference and understand completely, but it still hurt me pretty deeply as this was a person I was very much interested in and connected well with on so many different levels but the reason the relationship was discontinued is ultimately due to something I can never change.  I feel terrible and I'm still not over it.  I spend many nights just crying now because of how I look.  Any confidence I once had in myself before this whole thing is now completely shattered.

Anyway, here's a pre-HRT pic of me:

http://i.imgur.com/zN16gpn.png

If nothing else, this relationship experience has encouraged me to pursue HRT treatment sooner in order to help my outward appearance align with who I am more absolutely.  I've been putting it off for one reason and another, mostly just fear, for a short while but now it's all I can think about.

Anyway I guess the point of this is that I'm seeking opinions on what I can realistically expect from HRT and whether it'll likely make me passable some day.  I know it's hard to tell what the effects will be individually.  I guess I'm just seeking comforting words from anyone who has been through it because I'm in a pretty dark place right now and feel I'll never get to the stage of being fully accepted as female."

blackheartedninja,asktransgender,Would my Halloween costume be offensive to transwomen?,"So, I'm a straight cismale and I'm a huge Bob's Burgers fan. I shaved my beard to a mustache and went as Bob for Halloween last year. I had so much fun, and since Tina is my favorite character in the show I want to go as her for Halloween this year.

But not as a gender-bended Tina, just straight-up Tina. I've got a friend who can hook me up with a blue skirt and everything.

My intention is simply to go as my favorite Bob's Burgers character.

But as I thought about it I realize that a part of this costume has a shock value of ""omg a guy dressed as a girl,"" regardless of my intent. I wonder if this is insensitive to transwomen, or at least not helpful. I have the privilege of putting on this costume and going as a woman as a ""joke"" (to be clear, it's not a joke to me; I just think Tina is the bee's knees and wanna be her for a night), and then taking the costume off. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but Tina's character is voiced by a man.

Some direction in thinking about this would be helpful.

Lynvaire,asktransgender,Scared and looking for some guidance,"I'm 18, wanted to be a girl all my life. I only really started embracing it on my own recently, using a female name online and acting as if I were. I felt way more comfortable and more myself. I made a few friends online, and after a while, I opened up to them and told them I wasn't really a girl and 2/3 of them aren't talking to me now. I've been really scared about this recently, I've tried contacting my counsellor from high school but she hasn't responded. I've looked up support sites for depression and suicide in my city, because honestly I'd rather die than not make the change. I've looked up support sites for transgender and the stuff I found for my city was really shocking and almost horrifying. After reading the mtf stuff I kinda just lay in bed for an hour shaking and thinking my entire world was going to end. How would I ever pay those bills, what if I didn't pass the psych tests or the physical exam. I called one of the crisis lines but they were full, thankfully the one friend that accepted me messaged me and started to help. He pointed me here and I guess my question is this.
What should I know about mtf, who should I talk to, what types of services should I contact?
I'm reluctant to talk to my family, they're pretty old-timey and never really connected with me on anything, so I'm scared that if they don't allow me to make this decision, then I'm screwed and I'll have no where to run. How do I talk to them about it?"
PanTran420,asktransgender,Dating preHRT. A few questions.,"I'm still preHRT, I'm hoping to start early next year (waiting for insurance to kick in). I've been struggling with the dating question for a while. 

Some background info on me: 31 AMAB, came out to myself almost two years ago, came out to family this past January. Starting to come out to a few friends. I'm pansexual, but find myself mostly interested in dating people with female presentation/identity (don't care if they are cis or trans or non-binary, genitalia doesn't matter much to me).  

Until a year and a half ago, I was in a serious LTR (6+ years) with a ciswoman. It was not a good relationship for a variety of reasons (she was emotionally abusive, constantly jealous, overall just a mean person). The final straw was when I came out as trans and she got really really uncomfortable with the idea. She claimed to be bi, but I knew she really wanted a man, so adding all that into all our other problems, I broke up with her. That experience soured me on dating, and I'm only now wanting to start seriously dating again. I have had one casual g/f and a couple of male FWBs since then, but nothing serious and I made no mention of my transness.

Now that I feel ready to date again (or at least try to date again), I'm curious about how other trans people handled dating preHRT.  I have some specific questions, but would also welcome any general advice or input.

Specific questions:

How did/do you date? Was it focused online? Tinder/Grindr/Match? Or more ""traditional"" dating? 

If you met someone at a bar or something and went out with them later, how quickly did/do you tell them about being trans and having plans to transition?  After my experiences with my ex, this is what I'm most worried about. I don't want to get a couple of months into dating someone, start really liking them, only to tell them and have them freak out and leave."

Blairnatalie,asktransgender,giving HR a heads up.,"Good morning asktransgender, 

So I'm going to be giving HR a heads up but I'm having trouble typing up the email. I'm letting them know because I'm applying for benefits soon and I figured I'd get the name change out of the way first. I guess what I'm asking is how would you word it? 

Like I gotta have special licensing in my province so I'll need to get that switched over as well so there's no chance of hiding it lol.. not that I'm worried as it's becoming quite ovbious these days.

But everyone's opinion on how to write a respectful, professional email about this would be appreciated."

mitinvert,asktransgender,I finally accepted myself and transgender thoughts stopped completely. What's happening?,"So, the first time I realized I had a desire to be a girl was 3 years ago. (I'm AMAB, 20 y.o.) Everything clicked but then convinced myself that I'm making things up and deeply buried my feelings. Even still, I never stopped having subliminal transgender thoughts. Throughout my daily life, I frequently felt a deep desire to act feminine and be treated like a girl in social situations, wanted to look feminine to photos (I sometimes spent over an hour taking selfies of myself until the lighting and angle made my face look feminine enough), realized I have feminine traits and feeling euphoric, realized how feminine my movements are and once again feeling happy, felt discontent with the depth of my voice, enjoyed being called ""her"" by mistake and the list goes on. Yet somehow I kept my feelings repressed and simply thought of this as a guilty pleasure of mine, until a certain breaking point. I am close to graduating college and thought about my future about the first time. I saw absolutely nothing to look forward to, I was simply getting by in life and relying on video games as a form of escapism. That's when I finally broke down and decided to revisit my repressed gender identity issues. I finally accepted the possibility of being transgender and started researching online, watching transgender timeline videos, etc. That was a month ago. It became an unhealthy addiction, I dropped video games and started spending every minute of my free time looking up transgender-related stuff on the internet, trying to relate to it. I started soul-searching, trying to remember things from my childhood. I remembered how when I was 12, my mom once told me how a certain costume I was wearing made me look like a girl and it made me feel happy.

In short, I felt like I had finally figured myself out and I now **wanted** to be transgender. Strangely enough, during this month, all transgender thoughts started to wane. Now that I'm no longer repressing my thoughts, they're slowly fading away. I've gotten to a point where I almost want to forget everything and live as an ordinary cis male for the first time. Yet the doubts always come back, why was I feeling like that? Am I going to feel like that again?"
GabrielCesario,asktransgender,I don't think it's worth it..,"I been feeling rather down over the past couple weeks, and I think it has to do with my recent feelings about my gender and what I want to do. I have been trying to work out who I am and want to be, but my gender bullshit..it's hard to parse out what I want for my future. When I look in the mirror, I don't feel like i'm seeing myself. How can someone who has been photographed over the years, looked in the mirror countless times not see their reflection for what it is? I feel like my body is somehow deformed, that Mother Nature decided to fuck with me. I think back to my health issues a child, the treatments, etc. Maybe I never had a chance at a normal body, and that's why I feel this way, that I have no reference for normal. If I accept my condition for what it is, possibly being intersex, then where does that leave me on the trans spectrum? Do I have the case to transition, to decide I would rather be a man. Physically I look normal, but if you had seen the signs and known what to look for.. But the idea of being of woman, remaining a woman is exhausting. Everyday it feels like a burden, like some sort of contract that I have been forced to sign, endure and cannot break , because of my birth gender. But I don't want to be a woman, but I can't feel like I can justify the desire to be a boy. The image I have of myself is a prepubescent boy, no curves, no chest, no monthly bloodletting. But the process to gain all the things seems like more,more pain than my current situation. I ask myself if I could manage and I could, I how to behave, act, etc. But I wouldn't be happy. I don't know what it truly feels like to feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm tired and I wish I could forget this. It was easier then when I didn't know what I know now."
likeClockwork7,asktransgender,How likely is it that this is just a phase? (Long! D: ),"I apologize in advance for a long post! Just lots of thoughts to dump here, I guess.

I'm a 17-year old male and for the past five days I've been thinking almost constantly about the possibility that I could be transgender. I've pretty much resolved that I'll wait three weeks to see if such thoughts fade on their own or become more prevalent before making any decisions, but honestly I'm pretty impatient and just wanna see this subreddit's thoughts on this. I know you guys can't give me a sure answer. Oh well.



So about a week ago my girlfriend told me about a manga she's been reading wherein a feminine-looking male high school student wakes up one morning to find that he is actually female, and he tries hiding his change of sex from the school. (Edit: The manga was titled ""Boku Girl"") It sounded like typical ecchi-comedy-romance stuff, but the concept also made it sound strangely fascinating. I begun reading it on my own expecting to lose interest fairly quickly. On the contrary, I became obsessed; I binge-read it in two days, became the most attached to that main character that I've ever been with any fictional character, finished it, and cried hard for a straight forty minutes. As someone who has never shed more than one tear for a work of fiction, that was and still is very confusing to me, as the ending wasn't sad or anything. I guess it was just finishing something that I had become so emotionally attached to.

I realized that part of the reason it was so fascinating to me was because I used to have many fantasies when I was around 13 about various ways my life could be more exciting - being a character in a video game world, having a disability, having special powers, etc. One of the fantasies was waking up one day and being a girl and just continuing life that way. It was a nonsexual fantasy that I found pleasant and exciting, but it did not occur especially frequently.

Now, however, I find myself thinking that being a girl sounds very pleasant. The thought of being a girl has pretty much completely replaced the rest of my sexual fantasies, though I realized that all of my pornography interests have always placed a huge focus on how much pleasure the girl is feeling anyway, and I have sometimes found myself jealous of the girls present in (for example) bdsm pornography because it seems like they get more pleasure than I ever would. Being a girl still sounds pleasant outside of sexual situations, and I've (not deliberately, it just kind of happened) imagined a female version of myself that comes to mind very easily at this point. I can imagine myself carrying out everyday activities as that girl and it seems nice.



I realized that maybe I have some small dysphoria? I'm mildly uncomfortable with looking at my own penis (though only mildly). I hate body hair, and when I started growing hair on my legs I got self-conscious and was honestly surprised that nobody made fun of me for having hair on my legs. Turns out males having body hair is pretty normal, and I was the only one uncomfortable about it. I realized earlier today that the reason I'm uncomfortable wearing shorts and tank tops is because I don't want to show the hair on my legs or armpits. I also shave my face enough for facial hair to not be visible, and am still very uncomfortable with the thought of growing visible facial hair. However, if this is indeed dysphoria, it is all the bodily dysphoria I have ever experienced. I actually think my male hair (atop my head), face, and body all like decent otherwise.

I do not show some male behavioral characteristics (Edit: *stereotypical* male characteristics) (I am not competitive, I am not cocky, I am not compelled to believe that I'm right, I don't enjoy physical activity, etc.), but the extent of any feminine behavior (Edit: again, *stereotypical* feminine behavior) I've shown is sitting with my legs crossed in feminine fashion. Apparently that's supposed to crush your privates and be really uncomfortable for guys or something but it's how I've always been most comfortable sitting and I still do it regularly.

I did not have feminine interests as a child and I have not experimented with crossdressing or makeup or anything like that. I have never questioned my gender up to this point.

I experience occasional depression, but definitely not to a clinical extent and I actually consider myself a fairly happy person. I experience social anxiety very regularly and it definitely limits my interactions, but I have never associated it with my gender and I still don't.



So, I experience next to no bodily dysphoria, show no (Edit: stereotypical) feminine behavior, and have been having thoughts about being transgender for a grand total of five days. Additionally, these thoughts could easily be a fantasy provoked by reading the mentioned manga, though I'll say that I have never pursued a fantasy with five days of research on making it a reality. Given the choice to just wake up as a female I think I'd take it, and given the choice to have been born a female I'd almost definitely take it. However, being male is fine.

Just a weird half-sexual fantasy provoked by an ecchi manga that will pass with time? Or could it mean something more? How often does someone come to the extent of questioning his/her or gender to find that it was actually just a phase? I see some say that they felt very little dysphoria and just thought being the other sex would be preferable, though from what I gather this is an uncommon story.

Jeez, I wrote a lot for you guys. Sorry about that."
Dheixis,asktransgender,Some questions from a gay guy new to the wider LGBT+ community,"So I never had much interaction with LGBT+ people apart from a few gay friends until I started college a few weeks ago. I don't know too much about trans people, and now that I know a few trans people I trying to be very conscious not to seem like a complete dick but there are a lot of gaps in my knowledge that I'm afraid I'll trip over and at least this way I can (maybe?) be a dick anonymously to anonymous people. So to preface, I don't mean to cause offence (truly, apologies if I do) I'm just painfully in the dark and trying to be better.

1. Is a transitioned person now cis or still trans?
2. If a trans woman is attracted to men, is she a straight woman? And vice-versa
3. How should one refer to another person if their gender expression isn't clear (pronoun-wise) and it's an inappropriate time to ask?
4. I know a person is trans and they have told some people not to be surprised to hear people calling them by their chosen name but I still feel apprehensive and try to avoid names just in case someone tries to cause them grief over it. Is this wrong?

That's all I can think of right now. Again, I'm really sorry If I've been insensitive."
blumpkins_ahoy,asktransgender,Let's talk about superficial allies.,"The first person I ever came out to was my current housemate, a cisgender female. I told her I was questioning my gender identity and she was supportive. Great. 


However, now that I'm back living with her, we've had a few more extensive conversations about what it means to be transgender and I've done what I can to educate her. She considers herself a social progressive, accepting of people for who they are and affirming of their identities.... or so she says. 


In several of my conversations with her, I can't help but feel her letting her ignorance lead her thinking, despite me warning her not to. I've educated her about terminology: ""cis-het,"" ""assigned male/female at birth,"" ""transgendered,"" etc, and she either scoffed, invalidated, or insisted that I'm wrong. I've cautioned her on the consequences of being outed after she decided for herself to tell her family. She even started calling me by my chosen name out in public without using preferred pronouns despite never asking her to. In fact, I sternly told her I would not be ready to socially transition for a long while. When I bring this up, she just talks about how hard it is on her and her family. When I mention a doctor's appointment, the first thing that comes to mind is surgery.


And despite all of these missteps, she swears that she's an ally and that her home is a safe space. She's quick to share articles on Facebook, but I can't help but feel like that's the extent of the support I will see from her. I can't help but feel I'm nothing more than another cause for her to punch on her social justice punch card in order to level up her social justice street cred. 


The more I think about this, but more flawed I realize this person is, making me question whether or not I really should associate with her, or even live under the same roof. I've found that talking does little to help as each response is akin to ""get over it"" or ""you don't know what you're talking about."" 


Does anyone else have an ally in their life like this? How do you set them straight? "

bsb2001ca,asktransgender,Need help figuring me out,"Yes I know, only I can figure my self out... so long story as short as I can make it...
For the longest time, I wasn't really out, and being my female self meant going out to quiet places or dark places as to hide my makeup flaws so I wouldn't appear manly. Now fast forward and progress about 5 years later. I don't have much of a problem going out to dinner in my more open area downtown where it's just a normal thing to see different people all just hanging out. I went to pride and spent 12 hours as a girl, and it was empowering. For the longest time I always wanted to go out and do something prior to pride, and after pride I felt like I could just pick a girl or guy side and go with it. Then life take us by the horns and it was 2 months since pride and I fell back into the wanting to go to certain places. What bothers me and my gf is that every weekend we or mostly I feel pressure to do something that we can do my make up and be comfy as a girl; but with weather and money we can't always do that and I feel like since I've done pride doing make up and staying home is kinda lame. Now I can't fully transition because she'll leave me, she's just not attracted to a female physique, but still into me if I'm dressed like a girl. Now I guess what I'm asking is why is it so hard for me to be able to go get groceries at Walmart or something while presenting as female, but it's so easy to go clubbing or go to a nice dinner as my female self. This weekend I'm going to my first dinner outside of an GLBT area, and I've always feared what if they don't serve me a drink because my ID doesn't match what I present, I feel like that would be very embarrassing, but at the same time I know there are lots of people who maybe just haven't had ID changed yet and just live their lives as a girl outside of work. I saw this late and what is this ""part time"" mean? Part time just outside of work and home and social life is as a girl? What could be dysphoria? I'm not looking to have a problem, but sometimes I just hate that I have to or feel that I have to conform to being a guy when I would rather be a girl

So, like, I turn on my computer, and I'm like, ""okay, I should delete this off of imgur,"" when, in the *exact* spot I'm about to click, the Windows 10 restart prompt comes up. My computer then proceeds to restart *for an entire hour* and now I can't delete this gallery... I've put in a deletion request, but, like, *awkward*

In the past, I've expressed concerns over whether my breasts would develop, if at all, but at the same time, I've always kind of accumulated fat around my chest. I'm currently 4.5 months on HRT, and when I started, honestly, I was probably something like a 34A (I still can't measure my band size for *shit*). At this point, according to my poor tape-measuring skills (I still don't trust my measurements!) I'm *allegedly* a 34B.

Y'all probably don't remember my history, but I posted that, once, in the past, my mom sorta pushed me into getting a chest liposuction, and I'm still freaked out that that might have totally fucked up any chances I had for breast development. My breasts have been pretty sore for a while now, and they're sensitive, but I don't ever recall feeling ""breast buds"" (when I try to awkwardly ~~grope~~ diagnose myself, I don't feel anything ""hard"" beneath my nipple, and it's kind of painful to do that anyways) growing in.

[deleted],asktransgender,Has anyone else lost all interest in transition with time?,"Earlier this year, having realized for sure I was trans, I was obsessed with starting a DIY regime and enjoying the effects of the hormones. But now they don't interest me at all. While I still feel trans, I feel like HRT and transitioning in general has next to nothing to offer me. I don't want my body to have a female fat distribution on top of an unambiguously male frame/bone structure, I either want to be aesthetically male or female. I want to make a full switch, not be stuck in between. The effects of hormones sound trivial to me now, I don't particularly care about getting softer skin, I don't care about getting wider hips (I'm within the age of pelvic growth being a possiblity) because they would still be overshadowed by my wide shoulders, I'm not interested in growing boobs if they are cone shaped and only reach an A or maybe a B cup because on my barrel chest and huge rib cage, that would just look like man boobs and not feminine at all.

What are some of the steps you would take if hormone therapy is not available?


Thank you in advance to all of you who choose to respond. It means the world to me that I do this correctly




EDIT: To help everyone better understand this world and her role in it, here's some background info

She is quiet and reserved, though I feel that after her odyssey (heh, greek pun) she'll have become more outgoing. Currently she has to hide her identity from her father who is a patriarchal militaristic kind of dude who wants his first born son to be a son. In this world people who can experience what she does, both trans and cis, are revered as oracles. The people (called Helicians) believe that they can interact with the Gods because their soul is an incarnation of a God. In Helician mythology (much like greek mythology) the Gods are gendered, so it's very possible (and, in fact, more common than uncommon) for an oracle to be transgender.

Her role is a large one in this story. Think a little like Frodo. The Gods are warning her of a coming storm, one that threatens to bring back the Tyrants of a thousand years ago (basically the titans of greek mythology, massive and powerful creatures). She has to travel the known world in search of what I'm calling ""the heart of worlds"" which she'll be able to use to hopefully stop these Tyrants from returning.

So a bit more about this world, while the Helicians are generally more transgender friendly, they still only feel it as acceptable for oracles to be that way. Also, other parts of the world won't be even that accepting.

instemp,asktransgender,Out of area for desired insurance. How bad would it be to use a friend's address?,"Long story short: my current insurance is less than great, and I want to get on Kaiser instead. Unfortunately they aren't in my area. Someone recommended that I use a friend's address to sign up, but I am worried about potential legal ramifications. I mean, would that be insurance fraud?

Has anyone done this or known someone who has? What sort of proof of residency are you required to submit, and is it checked more than just at the sign up time?

Dcfan7738,asktransgender,Can transition make family relationships stronger?,"Has transition made any of your relationships with your parents, siblings, children better?  I've always been very withdrawn and kept to myself because I always felt awkward and uncomfortable with myself.  My two younger brothers are very outgoing and love to aggravate me in harmless fun and not afraid to show their emotions and careless what others think going so far as hugging in public which there is nothing wrong with but when I was in denial about myself I would get embarrassed and tell them men don't hug.

Also this is carried over into my life as a single parent where I'm so withdrawn and its not fair to my 8 year old daughter.

In the past I was afraid it would hurt her if I transition because she will feel like she lost her daddy. But I will always be there but I want to actually enjoy life and not merely survive it.

I could be wrong but I feel that my issue with relationships are a result of my gender identity because I have been on an antidepressant for over a year and it hasn't changed any thing

Jassy2cute,asktransgender,I got Reversed Misgender,"Lol so this is rather a funny story I'll share with my sisters :D
Last night I (22 MtF) was with my friend sitting outside my apartment complex and chatting it up about (You guessed it) boys! So there is this old woman who is super nosy and gets in everyone business and she saw me and friend chatting. 

She gave her opinions on our personal conversation and looked at me mid-sentence, paused for like 1.5 seconds and said ""Oh I thought you were a man but your a woman!"" Me and my friend started dying of laughter LOL

I guess my height (6ft) made her think I was a boy from behind but up close she saw my face. Kinda gave me a little confidence "
FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,A friend died and i am in the middle of my transition.,"An old good friend past away a few days ago. It is hard to deal with. I think I have been feeling that I am walking around trying to be normal and to keep shit together before and now that this happened it just doesn't make sense anymore. 
For example it's harder to stay away from that cis chick I know I should probably not be interested in its hard to keep calm , keep balance. It's like I have a volcano inside of me ready to explode. I need to find an outlet for this emotion and I do my best to control myself and not do anything that could harm me. Like going into a fucked up relationship. I just don't know what to do. Any advise. 

I also did the mistake to call my mother before to talk and we ended up talking about how confused she and my dad thinks I am for transitioning (Ftm). "
Dcfan7738,asktransgender,Possibly more than one trans person in the same family,"Found out my nephew may also be trans.  I'm still using male pronouns because I don't know for sure, but me and his grandma on the other side of his family were talking and she pretty much raises him, and I'm relieved that she said she will let him decide and regardless she will love and support him. I gave her some basic info and getting up some resources to send to her.

In my own case, I've just came to terms with myself at the end of my 30's and been trying to think of a way to come out to the rest of my family as I plan to transition.  This makes me think that I need to hurry up to do so, not so much just for myself, but so that they understand I'm speaking from experience, because if it turns out that the child is trans, I don't want him to end up unhappy and depressed because of feelings that was repressed for so many years like me.  She told me that he doesn't talk about it because he is ashamed and apparently one of my uncles, his great uncle who is a friend of hers, she had to cuss out because he gave him a hard time about it.  I have to hand it to the kid, I never had the courage to even speak the words to myself, ""I want to be a girl"" much less to another person but this child did. Even though I knew better, I've always hoped it was just a phase because I didn't want him to go through the same but decided that I would keep my eyes open so that I can be there for support.

Queen_Vera,asktransgender,6 months and no butt growth. Should I be worried?,"Hello, all. This is my first post on Reddit and I would really like to know basically what the question in the title is asking.

I turned 24 less than a month ago, and I've been on estrogen for 6 months now. I was on blockers only for a couple months before that.

I have gone from about 132 lbs to 143 in about two years. I am 5'9"". Yet my butt has not gotten any bigger since I started measuring it (at least 6 months ago). It's about 36 inches and I was exercising my legs and glutes every day for a few months. Still nothing in the trunk. Should I be worried at this point that I waited too long to transition and/or have bad genes for a proportional butt to my shoulders?

Sorry if this is a question answered elsewhere, like I said I am new to all of this.

Did you trans womens' butts grow? How long did it take? How old were you when you started your transitions? Thank you so much for any help!!"

042095,asktransgender,MTF friend in need of help,"Hi I'm here on behalf of a good and close friend of mine hoping I can help her like many others she has a lot of hurdles to clear and she doubts she can do it on her own so I decided to take it upon myself to help as much as possible. I want to start off by saying I will be revealing a bit of personal information about my friend and I do have her permission to disclose in order to help her out.

First I want to give the basics we both live in the same small town in the state of Tennessee and we both attend the same community college. Ok so here's the situation and to why my friend needs a lot of help over a year ago she came out as trans she decided to be honest and come out to her parents but her parents are religious conservatives so frankly her coming out to them didn't go well and she went back into the closet at her home at least and not only that she isn't allowed to be near me or any of her friends she met at the college so I can't come over to her house but we do see each other at the college or did the college has different campuses in different locations and this semester i'm at another location due to my job i have with the college thankfully she still has her privacy so we can text and talk over the internet without her parents knowing.  So basically she wants to get out of her living situation as soon as possible so she can start transitioning physically.

She needs to get a job so she can have an income for rent and hrt but this task has just as much hurdles as this whole situation does and this is where I need to disclose that she's also on the autism spectrum she can function well but she does have her issues and some those issues make most tasks for getting and keeping a job difficult and to make matters more difficult she's never been screened by a professional but I can confirm along with the college counselor and my mom who has worked with many young adults on the spectrum we would like to get her screened but it is very expensive to do it as an adult and her parents are no help either they're either too oblivious or refuse to see anything wrong with her and think she's just getting ideas. She has had worked two jobs in the past at goodwill and at walmart but she was fired due to poor job performance at both mostly autism related she was trouble working at the speed that the managers expected her to work. What I do know from knowing her personally she does get easily overwhelmed in fast paced environments and multitasking is next to impossible for her but she more than makes up by being possibly the most organized person I ever met and her attention to certain detail is certainly good. I have been brainstorming possible jobs she could work in the meantime and I made some notes detailing her strengths and weaknesses related to these job options.

Here's the list: 

clerical/administrative assistant- Might be the perfect job for her she's very organized and knows how to use a computer I am concerned however if the workload administrative assistants take may be too much for her to handle she gets overwhelmed when she's given more than she can handle

data entry- With Emily's organization and computer skills she can do this one too I don't think the workload is as much as being an administrative assistant either only thing she said she worries about is speed

retail- I know Emily's past job experiences and how she was fired for job performance issues but if she can just get something where her only tasks are sorting/organizing items or stocking retail can be a good job for her we're looking to see if she can get with someone that maybe willing to slow the pace down for her no special treatment by any means but just willing to not mind that she works slower than the rest

warehouse- Might be a long shot given she doesn't quite have the physicality for this type of work and her issue with fast paced environments but for what it's worth it matches to some extent with her current skill set and we have a Home Depot distribution center nearby that's hiring and knowing Home Depot they're lgbt friendly and I heard they're good about hiring individuals on the autism spectrum or have other developmental issues

fast food- This will be a hard sell I used to work fast food and I know for a fact this job will be hard on Emily but if all else fails she maybe able to get on at our local Chik-fil-a the franchise owner is known to be a nice person and non-judgemental they once gave free food to the college's lgbt club she might be a good fit there  

What we're hoping is maybe getting one these type of jobs and hoping they'll be understanding of her situation with being on the autism spectrum and let her work at a ""reasonable"" pace though I know having an official diagnosis will help a lot with that aspect. 

Oh I need to mention that she does already have a two year degree she got it just last year but her parents are making her now major in education to become a teacher which she does not want to do after a bad experience with the classes she took in the last two semesters for education and the reason she's even bothering to take classes this semesters is well it's what she kind of good at in a way it depends on the subjects she takes and plus she likes photography and wanted to take a course in that but she hasn't told her parents she doesn't want to be a teacher because she's afraid of what they might do especially since they're paying her tuition. Yeah I think it was a terrible idea to take a class behind her parents back but I wouldn't going to stop her from doing something that makes her happy.     

Another thing that needs to be addressed is living situation this is even trickier than the job situation due to the fact she can't just up and get a job while living with her parents because they're still making her continue her education and won't let her do anything else and as I said before she's afraid of them so yeah what I'm saying is she can't start an income until she's out of her parent's first so she has nowhere to go she doesn't have any other family to stay with and all our friends are college students living with their parents or just not in position to take her in and I love to take her in at my place but I live with my parents still and we're just not in position to take her in. This situation even has my mom baffled we both want to help the poor girl but we can't till she can move out but she can't till she has an income and she can't even do that till she moves out it's a cycle none of us can figure out how to break.

If anybody here can help brainstorm some ideas from what all I mentioned in this post I appreciate lots and it would mean a lot to my friend and to me if we all together can help her out of her current situation we're not expecting some miracle solution but maybe we can be pointed at least in the right direction thank you for taking the time to read and feel free to send me a pm if anyone has a suggestion we are both currently open to any ideas and suggestions we can take. I sincerely hope my friend can get the help she needs. 

Last thing I want to mention and this has me on the brink of frustration and why I've posted here this is more of a vent I want to get out. So my friend has been on this transgender support website for quite some time now always asking around the same things I'm saying now but she has a problem with most the responses from members of that site and I kinda think it's due to the fact most members of that site are much older than her and I the types of responses she would get are first very obvious like telling her she needs to get a job and giving suggestions as to what jobs to try to apply for but then she would mention concerns she has which are the ones I'm mentioning but instead of giving actual advice they give her the run around saying she just needs to work hard but they never give exact instructions how to do so or point to the right direction that can help her and with her autism that isn't good and leads her to respond with other concerns and they in turn interpret her as rejecting her advice and they get mad at her and then decide to ignore my friend so I decide to make an account there to see whats going and see if I can help my friend there and see if I can get members there to help brainstorm ideas so I basically ask the same things I'm asking now and some are helpful but then there's this one who gave my friend some of the same run around and it was one of the website admins she flat out tells me that my friend needs to work hard and how it took her eight years to transition and how she achieved through hard work while ignoring the situations I pointed out about my friend I take her as being pessimistic honestly. And they're ignoring me now go figure. I feel that website is to no help for my friend and most the members are stuck in the last century as far as dealing with life. Sorry for the long rant just wanted to say what I been wanting to say for the last three days about that site.

- if it takes at least several days or a week (or longer) to act, then will i have to restart all over if I miss doses of spironolactone?
- are there effects on spatial ability? or brain size? do the effects go away upon discontinuation of spironolactone?
- does it reduce the size of the annoying testicles? how long does it take for this effect to take hold?
- do most people who take spironolactone have to take it for the rest of their life? (I don't intend to supplement with pro-estrogens - I'm just sick of all of testosterone's effects)

Malkria,asktransgender,Anyone else have emotion trouble?,"I'm not sure how to ask this, but does anyone have issues 'feeling'? Like things your friends and family might be affected by you yourself  feel only muted if any emotion over. Or maybe even the 'wrong' emotion.

For instance when i work with patients and they are in pain...I don't feel anything. I act as if I do, since I know it helps them but I don't actually feel empathy. The same thing with my grandmother's death. I felt absolutely nothing beyond the initial shock, and even that faded almost a few hours after hearing the news. After spending a week with family where they were weepy and emotional about it...I felt absolutely nothing, it was just another day for me.

I have had therapists ask me if I was abused as a child, and beyond nobody wanting to talk to me about the transgender bit I have to say my childhood was as normal as could be expected. No trauma, no abuse, nothing that I can point to as to why I feel so emotionally disconnected at. So I wonder if this is normal about being transgender, or if I'm just broken in some way. So am I alone in this, or have others here felt the same emotional dissonance?"

AirRaidJade,asktransgender,My parents both think it's okay to deadname me in certain situations.,"Bit of background: I'm 20, and have struggled with depression for years, and I've spent the past 2 years unemployed with nothing to do but let my mind torture itself. I was extremely depressed, edgy, and irritable. Fights occurred often at my house. Everything was generally awful. This past August, I got a job, and having something to do and burn off energy and keep myself occupied has improved my mood greatly. There was a noticeable shift in my personality. Things have been pretty good since then.

In mid-September, I finally came out to my parents. They seemed accepting, at least outwardly. At one point soon after, they told me that the timing of this event, corresponding with the new job/personality change, would make it easier for them to adjust to the new name, because it seems almost like two different people - Jade is cool, [Deadname] is an asshole.

Great. However, this comes with one unstated stipulation - now, they think that when I'm in a bad mood, I'm reverting to my old personality and thus it becomes acceptable to call me by my old name. Only when I'm in a good mood do I ""earn"" my chosen name.

What do you guys think about that? Is it wrong? Or is that a legitimate use of my deadname? Should I do anything about it, or should I let them do it? I'm honestly leaning toward the latter, but if the correct answer is the former, then *what* should I do about it?

I really don't want to start shit with them about it. I mean, it *does* kinda make sense, I guess..."
illyajimenez,asktransgender,"Im really scared, a friend is not the same, I don't know what to do (long, sorry)","...about half a year ago in February I met someone. This person just started out as a friend to play games with whenever we were both online. Soon as I started talking just a little bit more, she helped me find out I was trans. There were times where we wouldn't talk for days or weeks but she would check in on me. She later gave me her KIK. From there we started talking daily. I ALWAYS felt like I was bothering her and would ask if I was, and she always said no. We kept the daily talking forever. Then one day she stopped responding like she used to. She would read the message and not respond till I sent another. She later told me she was seeing a guy and I totally understood that so now when I messaged her I would literally ASK if I can talk with her or she was busy. At this time i also noticed the way she talked was way different then before. It wasn't that she wouldn't respond that killed me, it was that she ignored me without a single saying that ""hey im busy"" or ""hey can we talk later"". I always said that ignoring someone when you're busy is one thing but ignoring someone on purpose is another. After a couple weeks she started replying like more and actually started talking like she used to...then...the ignoring started again. I would send ALWAYS asking if she was busy again and she would say no but she still ignored me. and soon she would go days just reading but no response...

i'm upset, because...she was an older sister to me....and she said i was her little sister...she helped me so much...she encouraged me to do so much...she was there when i need a hug or someone...and the thing that kills was she said, she would never leave me and never ignore me. I feel like i bothered her...i feel like i did something wrong....i feel like she shes me as a burden and a problem and someone who is just flat out annoying and stupid....i feel like she only helped me transition...i feel like she only talked to me cause she felt sorry for me....I miss my Onee-chan...and i want her back...but im scared to send her another message cause she'll get mad...

Fast forward to 4 years ago. We move to Canada and I realize that I don't have to act anymore. I can think for myself and be accepted. I found no qualms with people anymore, aside from negative traits such as overconfidence, egos and other toxic personalities. 

In December last year, my ex gave me the room to experiment with a femme persona for a day. It was awkward, but she was very happy and accepting. I decided to not do it again because of guilt for not being a real girl and how she was dating a guy. I don't try again till March. And this time, it felt comfortable. I didn't have to keep checking myself to stop being... cutesy, after a fashion. It felt good. I decided to do this for longer and longer, and soon I felt happier in my femme shoes than my real name and my real features and personality. 

Now I'm here, considering my options for transitioning, post break up, and I'm constantly having to fight off my old, crude self. I have to say shut up when I feel something stupidly homophobic coming to mind whenever I look at trans girls and it's very shameful for me. I want to move on, correct those mistakes of my past but they've stuck around. My heart tells me that everyone's beautiful. My old mind tells me that everyone isn't. I know, I'm a terrible person. I feel ashamed for calling myself trans, because I'm not...worthy of it. Not deserving. 

I want to abolish the homophobia, racism, and stereotyping I grew uo with. I want to be a healthy, compassionate person at all times. No more vestiges of my past. But I don't know how. 

Has anyone else gone through this? How have you ""fixed"" yourselves? I'm sorry if I was rude or disrespectful. "

Wickiot,asktransgender,Questions for post-SRS MtF,"Hey,

Amongst the many things I'm brainstorming about, there's SRS. I don't have a massive dysphoria over it, it's there and bothers me, I wouldn't go as far as saying I hate my genitals but one of the things I've often dreamed of is not having it and it's certainly a strong consideration somewhere down the line. However, there are some concerns holding me back from making a clear decision over it:

* ~~To a mild degree, I was told you have to wear a stretcher several hours a day for the rest of your life. Do you kind of get used to it? like it's there without making you notice it? (cue in tampons commercial music)~~

* Very serious concern, loss of gential sensations: Surgery can go bad and all kinds of shit can happen, surely there's even worse, but the idea I might possibly never get an orgasm again terrifies me. I don't suppose there's statistics on the prevalence of this problem, but I also don't know if in these years it's still a thing. Or maybe it was something with an old technique that isn't used anymore?

I know I don't have to have a whole plan laid out even before I get started, but it's the most daunting I can think of and I really want to consider it carefully. So, any input would be greatly appreciated.

EmiCol,asktransgender,Has anyone else had this problem?,"After 12+ months of therapy I finally told my therapist that I definitely want to start hormones.  Unfortunately, I still get some doubts about whether or not it's a good idea.  I mean I have no idea what my life will be like after a couple years on hormones.  That's the scary part.  I'm assuming that I'll be much happier, have less panic attacks, and not have all of my time being consumed by these thoughts.  I have no idea what it feels like to be seen as a woman though.  I plan on actually dressing outside of my house this month (not just Halloween) in hopes of calming these doubts/fears.  

After reading a ton of posts on here I can get an idea of how differently I'll be treated as a woman compared to a man.  

I guess the best way to explain my thoughts is by saying I have no idea what it means to be a woman.  I also don't know how to girl.  These thoughts suck considering I prayed a lot that I'd wake up the next morning as a girl when I was younger.  

EDIT: maybe I'm just so used to being male and that's what's causing these doubts?"

However,earlier today, my mom tells me that when I was about 3 I would try to dress up in her clothes and shoes often.

I live in MN and am on Medicaid, used to be Blue Cross Blue Shield but they were giving me trouble with some prescriptions so now it's through Medica.

zauraz,asktransgender,How do I overcome the taboo?,"I am an 18 year old most likely MtF. I however have a problem.


Growing up I fell into the norm that ""feminity"" in general was weird, disgusting and unwanted. Feminity in general for me was something I avoided. Pink, ""flowery"" shirts and other things stereotypically associated with femininty was central.

When I became 11 or 12 and started exploring my gender and my desire to be female was born made me suppress it as a sexual thing. I started crossdressing in private which felt liberating and amazing. I overcame this basic reluctance towards feminity.

Now however and since then I have this taboo regarding the female body. I was scared of seeing a naked female body for a long time (breast, genitalia) similar however to my fear of seeing a male body. The private sexual parts were teached to me to be private and taboo to look at.

Whenever I consider transitioning nowadays and feel like a female I sometimes see images of ultra femininty and they make me doubt as I still have this block in my mind telling me ""feminity"" is wrong for a male. I feel ashamed when I dress as my gender and generally for desiring something for this. What should I do to overcome this?

Tl;dr I grew up with norms that femininty and sex is taboo. How do I overcome this so that I stop doubting?"
mulderareyouserious,asktransgender,Big boy wanting to start T,"Alright so.
Quick background. I've always had hormonal imbalance issues. I have a growth in my pituitary gland that fucks with my cortisol levels and causes some weight gain. It's incredibly difficult for me to lose weight. I've been working for the past year to schedule a weight loss surgery, but with a delay after missing a single clearance letter from every goddamn doctor on the face of this earth, I will more than likely be waiting into early next year. 
I've been out since I was 14 and I'm 24 now. For a long time, the dysphoria died down and I was feeling okay. But lately, on top of being bipolar, the depression has gotten to the point where I've felt suicidal and, I mean, that feels really shitty. 
I have an appointment scheduled for the 24th to have the physical done. 2 weeks after, my bloodwork will come back and we'll find out if my body can handle T.
My only question is, I have a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR, and I'm 290 pounds at 5'6. (Hence the weight loss surgery.) 
I'm scared that I'll be denied. Does anyone know why someone would be denied T? I've seen guys that -look- bigger than me on T, but I'm not sure if they are. Yknow?

Reon98,asktransgender,Name?,"So, I've recently been experimenting with the idea that I might be gender fluid. Obviously I'm not certain yet and I'm not sure if I ever will be. However, I've lately been thinking on how the name thing would work.

On the one hand, if I'm gender fluid, I don't need to really change my name. I go by a nickname as is and, generally, it's not the most male name in the world (although it is associated with men). Leaving my name as is would allow me to exist in relative safety in a transphobic household/family- a thing I've been cursed with. This becomes especially crucial the more I'm at home.

But here's the thing: I've been fascinated with the idea of taking a new name.

Even before I thought it might be that I'm genderfluid, it fascinated me. I'm a Thespian by trade so I often find myself responding to names of old characters. I'm not extremely attached to my legal name right now. I think it would be nice to have a name I gave myself. A sort of new start if you will. Or even just a sort of stage name to keep relative anonymity in public (not that I'm famous or expect to be, but hey).

I've been messing with the idea of calling myself Lawrence and not particularly caring about pronouns. I honestly couldn't care less how I'm called pronoun wise- especially since I'm starting to actively seek more effeminate features (painting nails, growing hair out, etc.) 

I'm wondering how some people on here went about the name thing? Did you change it, what did you change it to? If you didn't, why didn't you? Are there groups of people with whom you go by your new name and others with whom you do not? Tell me about it please, I'm looking for others' experiences."

great__magnet,asktransgender,I finally came out to my therapist!,"Older (30s) male born female brain feeling person here. I know it may not seem like the biggest deal, but finally told someone about my gender issues rather than just stuffing them in the pit of my stomach. I'd never told a person before. 

It was so incredibly terrifying to put words to the feelings, but at the same time it's like some of the pressure and anxiety have let off some steam. 

I don't know where this is going and that scares me since I'm an admitted control freak. That's probably part of the reason I suppressed so much for so long. 

The direction society is going makes me more hopeful. When I was growing up, the representation of trans women was horrible. Crying Game, Boys Don't Cry, Last Seduction, etc etc etc. It was shown as a horrible secret. Something that can and possibly should get you killed. I'm glad that violent depiction is being related to the past. I'd like to commend the younger generation for being much more human on LGBT issues. For all the crap heaped on Milennials, you don't get enough credit for changing how the modern world treats sex and gender issues.

When I look at other post op pictures I can roughly make out the features when comparing it to a textbook diagram. I can see the inner labia folds. I can see the clitoris hood. When I look at my own self in the mirror, I just honestly have no idea what I'm looking at.

There aren't any landmarks at all that I can recognise. I don't even know if I have an inner labia? Like for most people it's like a little ""wall"" that separates the outer labia from the middle of the vulva. I don't have that at all? For me it's completely flat and smooth all the way from the outer labia right to the middle. 

Another thing is that in most pictures that I see, there's a clear line separating both sides of the outer labia, from the top to the bottom. I don't have that either. My outer labia is split apart for the bottom 2/3rds but after that it just merges together for the top 1/3rd! There's no clitoral hood or anything. The labia just merges back together above the clitoris.

I'm really really confused by my anatomy and I've been putting off sex with my girlfriend for months because I'm afraid of her thinking that I look weird. People say that vaginas come in all shapes and sizes but I feel like mine doesn't even look like one :(

Now  after four years of active questioning, I am in a bind and finally admitted to myself that I wish I'd been born female. I want to start transitioning, but T has been undermining my hair since I was 19 leaving me a thin Norwood III, while causing me endless amounts of dysphoria, despair and depression. Sadly, according to a couple of the best hair restoration surgeons, my hair is too fine for a transplant, and I don't think HRT will restore what I've lost given how long I've been loosing hair. I've been trying Finesteride and Nizoral with some results, but with mixed results.

Wigs would be my only option, but I have a very active lifestyle and travel extensively, so comfort and practicality I think rule out wearing wigs. (Alot of travel to hot and humid climates)

I am so angry, disappointed and feel horrible about my appearance every morning when I comb what hair is left, but feel my only logical choice is to continue living as a guy. 

Has anybody here encountered anybody who decided not to transition due to baldness? If so, what were some of their more constructive coping strategies?

I don't know if it's just because she is the female who I am closest to and most attracted to, and hence the model of what I want to be, or if it's something else.

It's especially weird because it extends to non gender things. She speaks a couple languages that I don't and is of a different race. Both of which make me feel some weird kind of envy.

I am not sure if this is dysphoria going into overdrive ('she's my favourite female so I want to be exactly like she is') or if it's that I have some unhealthy way of experiencing love.

Anyone else have experience of this?

I took the bus today and as the title said I saw a complete non passing trans woman. As a transgirl myself ( I think ?) I felt sick to my stomach. What I witnessed really made me think. Props to her for being herself but she was never ,I mean never gonna get gendered as female..she was tall af and im around 1.82 myself so I really felt like shit,she had obvious beard stubble and her outfit..literally looked like a clown.

Reality hit me hard,she was surely above 35 and I just turned 18 but fuck that if I ever transition and gonna end up like this..hell fucking no. I dont believe anyone can pass,I think your bone structure determines if you pass or not. My face isn't the greatest but I'd rather live as a dude than anyone laughing upon seeing me cuz I look like a freak. 

Im fucking putting trans thoughts behind maybe for ever because of that. I just feel its better to live as a dude and if im tired just hang myself and end it all.

Maybe social transition at least isn't for everyone. Im just saying what I believe. I'd prefer living as a somewhat feminine guy than being the attention of mockery wherever you go.

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,Well it's been 1 week on HRT,"I started HRT on 10/19/16

So far I've never felt happier. Although I did get really sick so that ruined it a little. 

Thoughts of suicide have diminished almost completely. You know, those random distressing calls in my head that would think ""kill yourself"". They aren't voices. Ugh, they were so annoying because it would go on for hours. I now suffer from ""why wasn't I born a girl"". So I guess that's better than the other thought. It's also not as frequent or that long. It pops in my head and I toss it out. The more female I look the less of a problem it is.

I've only noticed some minor changes. Like my boobs seem rounder. My skin on my foot only seems smoother. My junk has definitely shrunk. heh - which is good in that I'm less horny. 

I've gotten use to spiro as my mouth isn't as dry as it was. I still pee a ton.

As I continue on my journey the more I realize how much I need a va'jaja. That's still a year or two away tho. Surgery scares me a ton still. I hope to get over it by then.

I dunno just wanted to type something out on my 1 week anniversary. "
NinthOverlord,asktransgender,It's time to start living life the way I want to.,"Even if I say that, I know it will take some time to build up my courage to actually fully live the way I want. I will start slowly, taking baby steps. That first step is admitting to myself that I'm transgender.

As long as I can remember, I always doubted myself. I always questioned my feelings. I turned to other people to look for their advice. I realized today that I have a problem with trusting myself and my own judgment. It's time I start listening to myself, and well, my judgment is telling me I'm trans.

I want to be a cute girl god damn it. Even if I can't be cute, then I will at least try my best. If I don't try, how can I even keep going?

""What if, in the future, I decide that I'm not trans?"" I ask myself. Well, then I will just go back to living the way I was before, but now with a giant middle finger to the world.

KrisEtKris,asktransgender,Something is definitely wrong here...right?,"So after some time of taking hormones sublingual, I changed to injection every 2 weeks. After my fourth shot of estradiol, I took a blood test about an hour after I took my shot and it was as low as 91.90pg/ml...

To be fair, it was my first estradiol in 2 weeks and I heard that those who take injections, levels do go off after quite a while... Perhaps the shot I took wasn't affecting me right away..? Is this normal?

Syuas,asktransgender,(MTF) Is chest pain two weeks in normal?,"Just recently started HRT so I'm new to this. I started HRT on the 28th last month. (.5 estradiol twice and 50 Spiro once) My first few days I experienced bad leg cramps tI'll I realized water helped. Now today makes two weeks officially but two days ago I started having chest pains. At first I brushed them off but I noticed on that day and since my nipple have been more pronounced which is odd. My grandmother has pretty big breasts while my mom has small ones. Also when I was a young teen I had male breast growth (forgot the word), not a lot but it's been there since I was 15ish I think. I'm 24 now. What I'm asking is it normal for me to feel such changes so soon I just started like wtf. I can feel a small lump/bud maybe behind my left chest slight pains in my right very rarely compared to my left. I'm black idk if that's relevant btw.

SomanRionis,asktransgender,"I don't know if I'm trans, and I don't know if I want to be.","Of course not being trans would be preferable. I'd rather just be comfortable with who I am, but at this point I'd happily take just being sure either way. 

Sorry if this post is a mess, so is my brain right now...

When I was younger, I was very energetic but also shy and reserved. Apparently this is the ultimate bully magnet as all the way through primary school and most of secondary school I was bullied relentlessly. I came to hate pretty much everything about myself, and my self confidence has never properly recovered... :/

The only real respite I got came during secondary school (all boys school), and it was through music. I was in my school orchestra, and went on several orchestral courses outside of school. The former involved every year spending about a week's worth of hours at the girls' school across the road, and the latter was considerably more females than males.

I still wasn't *popular* at either. But people were nice to me there, didn't treat me like shit for existing. I got on way better with girls than I did guys, and I actually felt like part of the group when I hung out with the musicians I knew. 

I think I was around 15 when I first started questioning my gender. But I already had enough reasons to hate myself so I ignored it as best I could. I kind of assumed it was a ""grass is greener"" situation. Where I was going from ""I enjoy being around girls more than guys"" to ""maybe I'd enjoy being one...?""

When I left school and went to uni, my life got infinitely better. I didn't get bullied any more, although I mainly kept to myself. I had a couple friends, and that was enough. 

It was around the time I went to uni that I decided maybe I was trans. I told the few friends I had from secondary school, and they all were cool with the idea except for one who didn't think I was, but he refused to give me grief for it because ""at the end of the day it's your life"". That was enough for me, and we just kinda all left it at that. 

I tried seeing a counselor but I didn't know how to interact with them and it felt pointless so I gave up on it, which I regret in hindsight. I told them I thought I might me trans and they basically went ""okay"", which while a good reaction, I was hoping they'd question it to force me to question it so I could figure it out, or something. I don't know tbh. 

By about a month into uni, I was pretty sure I was trans. And then, I fell in love with someone. For the first time in my life I was genuinely happy. Not the absence of sadness. Actual happiness. All thoughts about my gender or anything like that were pushed to the side because finally I had found someone around whom I didn't feel like I needed to ""fix"" myself. 

I'm now 21. We've been together just shy of 3 years... and at some point I started questioning again. And I can't make those thoughts go away. It's like I have to sabotage my happiness some way or another. 
 
---

I realise I pretty much just wrote out my life story but I don't know what is and isn't relevant at this point. 

The thing is, if I do decide I'm trans, it could fuck up all the good things I have going for me. 

If my parents don't approve, I'm fucked because I'm currently financially dependent on them while I try and get a decent source of income. I don't think they would be against it but I feel like they'd not necessarily be for it either, if that makes sense?

Thankfully my sister would be with me whatever I decide, no question of it She's always been there for me, even if we argue.

My girlfriend is very much straight. I've actually spoken to her about this before because it's not something I wanted to keep from her, and she said that if I did decide to transition we'd probably end up breaking up because while she'd still love me and would try to stick it out, she just isn't attracted to girls. Which is fair enough I guess, but I don't think I could just stop loving her if it did end.

On top of those two things, I'm not *unhappy* as a guy, per se. It just feels like something is missing or slightly wrong about my body, and that maybe it's my gender.  I just don't know if it's self loathing left over from being bullied for 12 years, or genuine dysphoria..."
Neosquid,asktransgender,anyone wanna talk?,"I just feel like talking to somebody, been feeling more down lately. "
Calypso57,asktransgender,Does anyone else do this? (Video games),"I never really payed attention to it but literally every game that has the choice between a female and male character I subconsciously chose the female character. I never noticed but probably because it was and feels natural. 

Also I always choose the villain lmfao. Usually the villain is way more interactive, lively, and much more developed.

Oh and also elves. I think I have an elf fetish although I don't think I'd call it a fetish. I just think elves are the perfect ideal being!

And bow &amp; arrow rather than other weapons.

Any video game options you automatically choose out of love, habit, or whatever?"
Heockius,asktransgender,Just taking a few minutes to get things out of my system.,"Well. It's been a few months since I last posted something what wasn't a reply. 

I've been going on with my journey. Honestly I can say that every step and every development I have loved. I've been happier and slowly getting more confident than I have been since I was maybe 10.

I just want to lay my whole story and I'll get to what brings me here. Strap in readers, this will be quite a wall.

When I was younger. Gender wasn't something I thought of. While I was in school I never played with anyone. I was fine on the edges. Then when middle school came I switched to home schooling. I played with my sister and we played whatever. It was nothing to play house one day and the next we were adventurers. So I never associated games with gender.

I was also brought up in a christian family. Sitting in that I never even thought about it. Although I never felt like I fit.

I do remember some things when I was in kindergarten or first grade. I was actually thinking about when I grew up having a child. Not being a dad. Actually carrying it and all. I had no filter and was going over the idea with my best friend at the time. He looked at me like I was INSANE.  Seriously he said, ""No That doesn't sound neat... Why would it?""

I went on with my little ideas and honestly. I guess a part of me was wise for my years and knew that wasn't the time. (Although I wish it could have been ya know.)

Now yes. I loved the boy toys. So did my sister. Hell, sometimes I played with her dolls because I didn't have an appropriate ""character"" for one of my stories. 

Going forward to high school age. I was always different. A bit weird to my peers but a ""nice guy"". A ""Good guy"" I remember someone from one church I was in saying how I had the build to be a great football player in the future. In my head I was all. Ew... No...

I never got into sports. People looked at me odd when they met me and I hadn't seen the latest game or had no opinion on a draft pick or something. 

During adolescence bugged me half to death to grow a beard and EVERYONE supported the idea. I didn't want it. I wanted to keep my face clear. But in time I relented and kept hearing how good it looked. 

I did start to grow my hair out in my late teens. I told people it was because I was to lazy to get a haircut and it just stuck. But it felt right.

Then as I got into my twenties, a girl I dated at the time introduced me to a program called IMVU. Hey hey! Stay with me! As a chat program using 3d avatars I went with a male avatar at the time and got on it as it was the easiest way to talk to her. (Long distance. Story for another day.) Well her and I broke up. But I stayed on the program. 

It started as a ""Heh. This'll be funny."" I got a female avatar and used it from time to time. But that time to time turned into constantly. Then I switched my gender tag to female. It felt right.

Since childhood I had admired a certain story elements. Seeing a male character changed from male to female. Not crossdressing for some comedy reason. But actually a change. Ranma 1/2 is probably the most famous example. Although in my quietest moments I told myself that I would try to stay in the fem form no matter what. But nothing like that could happen in reality. 

I met new friends on imvu. Eventually they became people I wanted in my life. I explained myself. Most of them did not believe it at first. ""But you don't seem like a guy."" 

""Have you considered changing irl.""

That was an interesting moment. I hadn't. My response at the time was, ""No. It would never be complete, right? I could never do it. I was put into this body for a reason. No matter who I am deep down.""

I also made several trans friend on there. I marveled at their stories.

This was just online. It was just my online self, or gaming self. It seeped into my life. 

Then I met my wife. A fantastic woman that inspired me to better myself. To stop rolling in the mud that was my life and do better.

Since we had moved in together and all, she started to notice something about my persona. She often joked that we were backwards. She thought certain girly outbursts (The way I got excited over things, the way I expressed myself) were adorable. 

Then the dream. Wow... Could I try to make that seem more ominous?

But seriously. I had always had occasional dreams where I was female or at least a nebulous sense I was ""Me"". Occasionally I wasn't me in my dreams. Those dreams usually held onto something for someone else or a generalized message...

But one dream from earlier this year stood out significantly. 

I had made the change. I know this was the topic because it was one of the first things I ""Knew"" in the dream. I had to lose weight and I was working on that. Just dropping it rapidly. People cropped up to support me. Do things for me to help my journey. It was so VIVID! When I woke I felt so disappointed. 

I could not dislodge that from my brain. I kept mulling it over.

A youtuber I followed came out before that dream. SHE popped up on the scream and explained why she hadn't posted in months. Three months before she had started hrt. 

Just three months and she was gorgeous. I sought her out on facebook. Thankfully she did wood carvings of anime and video game characters and had a little business page that was easy enough to get in contact with her on. I asked her everything. How she had gotten the hormones so quick, what led her to make her decision. She told me about Informed consent. An option some of my friends hadn't had access to.

She also pointed me here where I learned even more. Clinics in my area and so much helpful supportive information.

I wrestled with this. ""She"" The fem I felt just under my skin was seeping into my life more and more. I shaved. I got a stationary bike that I started using almost religiously.

I told my wife everything and she said she was fine either way. But watching me obsess over what to do was the only part she could do without. 

I kept asking. What if I'm not. What if I am and don't take this chance? I made a few phone calls and went to one clinic to set up financial stuff first and set my first appointment. Then april 27th just 2 days after my birthday I had my first exam. Had the typical rundown of my vitals and my weight. I had a lot to lose there (And still do but I am so happy with my progress.) Blood tests and papers to read over and an appointment scheduled for a month after. 

I won't bore you with details from then. There were hurdles, but my doctor is fantastic and she's had my health in mind for the whole journey. 

Over the past few months I've been actually happier. Little changes along the way Some big changes too. Trying to keep clean shaven and testing things to do that even better. Learning how to do make up and all (I still have a lot to learn.)

I've been slowly piecing together what will be my girl mode.
I also want to brag that I think I have a couple of the best friends any person could ask for.

I've shown my attempted girl mode to my closest friends and wife and all. They told me they thought I was doing pretty good. I know I still have some ""guy"" mess hanging on constantly reminding me of who I was.

I came out to my wife's side of the family. They seemed fine with it.

So this last weekend I had to house/dog sit for them while they were on a trip. 

Well the day they were supposed to return I decided I would show them as well. I thought they were supportive.

But her aunt looked at me and said, ""You know you look like a cross dresser, right?""

I knew it wasn't perfect. But ya know, I had made real progress. I felt better about who I was than I had in a long time.

One sentence and she destroyed me, but did she stop there. She drove me back to my place (As I had not used my own vehicle to get there.) And berated me along the whole trip. She said I didn't know what I was doing. How I needed to dress for how I actually looked. She could see a five o'clock shadow. (Mind you I had JUST SHAVED an hour or so before they got there. My make up game isn't that good, but my shaves are. I am aware of my beard shadow but Five O'clock mess takes me till five the next day anymore. Minor yay.)

And on. How the doctor probably hadn't perscribed real hormones. I could probably get the exact stuff I was on off ebay for cheap. (I checked, you can't.) How to even really get started I had to live a year as a woman (Which by her own logic would have been impossible.)
How in five years I was gonna wake up one day after getting SRS and all and saying, ""What have I done?"" How I was so irresponsible for going for it. How bad my voice was. (Which to be fair it IS bad but yelling at dogs who only seemed to respect a male voice for three days had my throat sore.)

She kept hitting me with all of this. When she first met me I had a beard. I had been with my wife as a male. On and on trying to invalidate me at every turn and not letting me speak up. I... A 30 year old person sat there and took it. I am ashamed of myself. I should have yelled. Screamed. Told her to pull over I was going to walk. To... to... something. I don't know. I was so frustrated.

She didn't see me cry. By the gods I was not about to allow that. THAT happened two hours later. After I got home. I learned crying make up off is much more messy first person.

Now... Here I sit a full five days later and the whole scene still rattles in my head. It feels like she purposefully hit every one of my fears and insecurities. 

I thought I had quieted them but now I face them, angrier than they were before. I do have friends that were ready to go to war with her over this. 

I can't stop this though. I won't stop this though. I know who I am and just how far I've come. I have had to reschedule an appointment I had this month a couple times but that's transport issues. (It's a bit of a drive.)

Phew... That was a long one... If you read it then thank you. My story is probably a bit odd. But yeah, it is what it is. "
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,Am I really able to say that I know what's best for me at my age? That I know this is what I want?,"Pretty soon, I got a doctors appointment to get a recommendation for a therapist. But I feel like I need to say to both the doctor and my dad that I'm not seeing a therapist to figure out if I'm trans. I know I'm trans. And I'm thinking of pressing starting transition.

But do I really have the right to say I know what's best for me? That I know transition is what I want, or that I'm 100% trans without having talked to a therapist?"
hopeless92,asktransgender,Rebuilding your life after detransition?,"After five years of endless frustration and futility, I recently decided to permanently abandon social transition (I am still taking HRT to prevent MPB).

&amp;nbsp;

The last 5 years of my life have been spent chasing one futile endeavor after another (be it HRT, hair removal, FFS, voice training, etc.) in hopes that eventually I would be able to pass as a women, re-integrate into greater society, and move on with actually living my life.

&amp;nbsp;

In the end, that goal was nothing more than an unattainable fantasy. At this point I have exhausted all modern medical and surgical technologies, and I can now say definitively that my transition was a complete and total failure. Now I'm left picking up the pieces of what's left, and doing my best to try and push forward in life as a cisgender man.

&amp;nbsp;

Transitioning came with immense economic and social costs. I lost my family, my friends, a bright career, and over $50,000 in sunk costs which could have been allocated elsewhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Fortunately, I've faced worse than where I currently am now. I suffered from a long and nasty period of homelessness, before I eventually found employment and housing by hiding my trans status and presenting as a man.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been working a dead-end job at a call-center to survive over the past year, but now that I've abandoned my plans regarding transition, I've been thinking about trying to build my career back up. Unfortunately, despite my MBA and a few years of relevant experience prior to transitioning, I worry that the subsequent employment gap (i was unemployed for about a year, and I've only juggled low-wage jobs since then) following my dismissal from my prior job for coming out as trans is going to be a black mark for hiring managers that I won't be able to overcome. I'm contemplating returning to school to get a PHD, or maybe just some technology certificates, but I'm already pushing 28, and I worry that any more delays in building a career might lead to my doom.

&amp;nbsp;

And then there's the social implications. I've considered reaching out to my family and some of my old friends who deserted me after I came out, but I feel too embarrassed to pull the trigger and come crawling back to them in shame.

&amp;nbsp;

tl:dr

I've wasted the last 5 years of my life trying to transitioning. I've given up and I'm stuck on where to go from here in life."
ThrowUgly123,asktransgender,Writing a paper on my and other surgical experiences,"So today I came in contact with one of my old professors from back in my college days and have talked to her about writing an academic paper about reverse effects from cosmetic surgery and how it puts its victims in a negative mindset.

alt123442311,asktransgender,What should I tell my grandparents if anything at all?,"Hi, I'm going to post a few more questions on this alt because I really don't want my main account being linked to this.

So I've lived with my grandparents since I was four.   I've been really pushed towards being a ""normal"" boy through sports and cars and similar things but they never really stuck.  I've never really told them anything about how I feel but I think my grandmother has noticed over the years since she has told me on various occasions to ""stop acting gay"" among other things.  I think she knows since she said to me just a few days ago ""you don't look like a woman you know.""   That hurt a lot more than I thought it would but I held my tongue.

Anyways my problem is that she wants me to take testosterone supplements to be ""more manly"" and I'm afraid I can't refuse because she's helping pay for my college.  But I don't think I could handle even more testosterone than I already have, I'm trying to reduce it not increase it.  I don't want to tell her no but if she forces it on me I don't know what to do.

Also a second question since I don't want to clog up the sub with my nonsense too much.

What are your experiences with the different anti-androgens?  With the side effects and effectiveness of the various ones.  I'm planning on self-medicating since I can't afford to have the medicine show up on my insurance unless I want to get disowned.  So is there a detailed guide for self-medication?

steakhuskybouldering,asktransgender,I need some help with my relationship,"I'm a highschool senior and my boyfriend of 3 years began transitioning earlier this year. 

Now I know people will laugh at me when I say this but I love her. I know everyone says it won't last but today I'm in love and that's what matters. 

I'm happy for her transition and I'm happy that she is happy. 

We've had a pretty tough environment on our relationship. I'm a jock so I constantly get shit for being bi and dating him before she transitioned. It doesn't bother me but I know it bothers her and it really pisses me off that people care so much about us.

We get it from all angles too. The girls, the guys and the teachers and coaches for me. It's all annoying.

I have a pretty thick skin and I'm not a very emotional person and she isn't either, but constant abuse hurled your way is only so much a person can take and it hurts me to see her have to shrug things off.

That's not really why I'm here, though. I just kind of wanted to express that and ended up doing it.


The reason I'm here is that idk if I'm wrong for something. I hope this is okay to post here. Here goes: we've had a lot of sex since we got together before she transitioned. But now that she is transitioning I've wanted more and more.

I don't want to be a chaser or make her feel like an object. And I just want to know what to do to be a good boyfriend in this situation. I know this sounds like I'm asking how to be a human but I just want to make sure I'm not changing the way I treat her. The only thing I notice changing is that I've wanted sex more.

Wannabkate,asktransgender,Bigotry in retail.... (part 1) Cooties....,"So today we had an interesting encounter at my Starbucks. So I am on bar making drinks left and right. Ok so it was part of slow time but I had a few drinks to make. 3 of them belonged to a man of middle eastern descent(as far as I could tell). Only mentioning this because its mostly white people who have issue with my transy-ness.

So I make his drinks and call them out, A white mocha and two iced waters. I look to make sure he knows they are ready. And I see him pull my worker aside who had just rung him up. I think, ""oh he must be asking for the bathroom code. Cool he will pick them up in a couple minutes."" So I go to start making the next drink, a frappoccino. There's always one of those.

She  then comes over the bar. 

She says to the customer, ""oh she already made them."" 

Then he replies, ""can you just make them over"".

Keep in mind that he didnt even look at the drinks and she offers them to him, but he refuses to take them. I, of course just continue to make the other drinks, as I see her grab new cups for the drinks and makes them. 

She hands them off to the guy. And after he walks away. I ask my coworker, ""Was that exactly what I thought that was."" She responds, ""He said, that he wasn't a bigot but wanted her to make them for him.""

I laughing say to my coworker ""Well anyone who says they are not a bigot. Followed up with a But.... They are a bigot.""

""And well I guess he just wanted to avoid the LGBT cooties, Which is a shame because you are Bi.""

She then informs me that she's has a girlfriend and is in a lesbian relationship. Which I am elated because this is news to me. I knew that she went on 2 dates with her but not that it was official.

TLDR: Customer doesn't want my LGBT Cooties on his drink, ends up getting my coworkers LGBT cooties. And she's finally has a girlfriend, she's totally adorkable.

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,Changing name in my paypal account??,"Does anyone have experience with doing this? I've been super lazy and haven't changed my name with my bank yet. But I'm planning to go change it there soon. My name was legally changed in May, and at the end of the summer I finally went and got a new ID/license with my new name and changed gender marker. Soon after I got the paperwork back from the court about my name change, I filled out the forms within paypal to have them change my legal name on my account, and sent them scans of the official name change paperwork from the court. It said it may take a few days to put it through their system, which was fine. But I did this in like late May or early June, and they still haven't changed it yet. I sell on ebay regularly, so I use paypal for money transactions all the time. So I'm worried if I change my name with my bank that there will be this disconnect within paypal, and it won't be able to transfer to my bank account because the info doesn't match my paypal info. I know that's unlikely to happen, but I'm still worried. Even if that won't happen, I still would just like my name on my paypal to be changed because I don't like having to see my birth name every time I go to the site. Other than filling out the form within paypal again, I'm not sure what I can do to change my name in paypal. I don't want to have to create a whole new paypal account or anything like that. "

Questioning250,asktransgender,Why do I question my gender every time after masturbating?,"Ive been questioning for a few months now (AMAB age 20). Since puberty I've been exclusively female in my sexual fantasies, and when thinking back I realized I've been more or less questioning my gender after almost every masturbation session. It's not so much conscious, but more like a subconscious unsettling feeling that somethings wrong. Then for years I'd respond to this feeling w/ ""it's just a fetish"". Again, it wasn't really a conscious thinking about whether or not I was Trans, it was just a subtle disconcerting feeling that made me respond in that way. What does this mean?

I don't mean it goes away after finishing. It's happens after finishing, and is a sense that there might be something more than a fetish.

I wish I knew I could be trans even if I didn't want to wear girl clothes as a kid.

There are plenty of examples, as I've learned on here over the past year. What stereotypical transgender symptoms really messed you up in discovering your true gender?"
DucatExchange,asktransgender,[mtf] BA self doubts,"I recently found out that my health insurance (kaiser) has started covering breast augmentation, yay! But now that it's an easy and affordable option, I'm starting to have serious doubts about doing it. Oddly, it's a much harder decision for me that bottom surgery was. 

On one hand I've had basically no breast growth at all, which is kind of bothersome (on some days). I kind of like the androgynous look it gives, but sometimes you just want to be really feminine, you know? It'd be nice to look somewhat proportional if I ever want to, say, go to the beach or wear a dress.

But at the same time the failure rate is a bit of a concern. My doctor said 1-1.5% per year chance of it leaking, and that I'm basically guaranteed to have to come in every 10 years or so to get them replaced, which sounds like a major pain. 

I guess I don't really have a question, just want to talk to people who are considering BA or have had it and get their input. It feels like maybe I should just learn to accept what HRT has given me, or else i'm going to be getting surgery on everything I can and where will that end?"
Ash_Robin,asktransgender,Thoughts about adding Progesterone or Birth Control to my HRT Regiments.,"I have been struggling with dyphoria recently; it typically stems from my areolas and nipples. I have been contemplating taking birth control in attempts to make them grow more closely to a cis-female. I am not sure what to do?

Should I seek out birth control as a means to increase my progesterone (currently taking none) or should I ask for an alternative to my spirolactone which is Ciproterone (which has t blocking effects plus some progesterone like effects). Or should I simply just ask my endo for Progestrone at my year 1 appointment?"

Elena1270,asktransgender,Possible letter to my dad what do you think,"I am still very much closeted and I do not know if or when I will have the courage to come out to my father and the rest of my family. I had thought of writing a letter as I dont know if I could come out to my father in person for not only the fear of rejection but also the fear of violence.

Possible letter to dad.

Dad, 

Let me start by saying I love you very much. That said, there is a certain aspect of my life that I have kept hidden for fear of rejection. I am transgender. This is something that has been a long time coming and something I have thought about very seriously. I did not make this decision in a hasty manner. I know now that I have been different all my life. Perhaps it started when i put on a pair of moms stockings and liked them. Maybe it was when I would look at the girls in their dresses and wondered what it would be like to be a girl. I know now that not only did I like girls and what they wore, I wanted to BE them and wear what they were wearing. So after many years of buying stockings and shoes then purging my collection over and over I have come to this conclusion that I am transgender and have decided to transition. This has been the HARDEST decision I have ever made in my life. 23 trans people have died due to fatal violence this year alone. This doesnt take into account all the trans people who have been harassed and beaten. Being transgender is not a choice and I certainly wish I was a normal male as I know full well that life as a transgender person can be very difficult and downright dangerous. My transformation will not change my overall personality. I still like trains like I always have. My transformation will not change my sexuality, I have been a straight male and will be a lesbian as a female. All that will be changing is the way I dress, the way I look somewhat, the way I talk and my first and middle name. I would NEVER consider changing my family name. I carry the xxxxxx name with pride no matter what. I am begging you, please dont hate me! Please dont disown me! I need and want you in my life. Please accept me for who and what I am, a female, a woman.

Your loving daughter

peartrans,asktransgender,I dont understand while seemingly more androgynous individuals still display extreme male or feminine behaviors.,"When I say this I mean cis males and females. I think of all the men in my family and they arent the most masculine of types. I mean they are in some ways but I feel like in general they arent. Then I think of the women in my life and even the more androgynous ones still display stereotypical feminine behavior and it just seems inauthentic to me. 

I just have been feeling crappy lately because I am unemployed and am not able to be where I want in life which has made me feel hopeless and thus think about these things.

 Like why am I transitioning anyways? I think of stupid stereotypes all the time and I fit neither male or female. But I would rather transition medically and maybe not socially now but I have a feeling thats not going to feel right. I always think of gendered activities in the future like for example since I have to look for work as a guy I'm going to feel like crap when everyone assumes I'm a guy. But I would feel like an imposter presenting as a woman. Idk my comfortability with my identity comes and  goes.

I just really hate the gender binary."
tomatoes-comatose,asktransgender,So I am thinking about my gender identity.... .,"Well, I guess it all really started last year, or around 2014 when I really started to realise I'm not a straight, and am at least homoromantic heterosexual (or biromantic heterosexual) and AMAB. 

The first thing I noticed upon my fantasies when I thought of being with other men was that I imagined myself in the form of this girl I used to like while being intimate with anyone, rather than my own physique which isn't particularly feminine.  Before that I usually fantasized about lesbians or just thought of women and me in my own physique.

Well, it stayed that way, the only thing I did to get me remotely feminine looking was I made sure to lose weight so I looked a lot smaller (I was kind of fat) but essentially maintained the same hairstyle and continued to be masculine, while continuing to have a crush kind of on a guy (very feminine looking) until around march to April 2015, when I started to feminise my appearance a little. Got rid of the pompadour, let the length demonstrate itself, by playing it down, shaved more often. (no makeup or hormones) 

Off course, earlier my fantasies as the female/feminine involved a female body that was much smaller, and now I was much smaller than earlier and more feminine, so felt a little less cringe when I looked at myself in the mirror, but was fine, kind of outing as bisexual. 

Well, this is when it kind of fired. I began to question my sexual orientation beyond simply bisexual, I wanted confirmation. This led me to read a lot about lgbts and introduced me to the idea of being transgendered. I remembered a few fantasies about it, where I would see a skinny girly girl and fantasise about one day waking up with bodies exchanged (like that movie, ""its a boy girl thing"") and all that. This did not bother me much, as I just figured I wanted to be a little more feminine, that's all. 

Until recently when I CD-Ed, and found that experience arousing. It wasn't just the clothes, I liked the curve difference as well, and I was kind of convinced I was trans, but did question on, and I found that there were times when I liked the male physique for myself (not mine, I am a little fat) and times when I liked the female physique. 

At present I find that there are times when I like being masculine and there are times when I like being feminine. Off course my current, large (kind of fat) physique continues to make me cringe, so I would obviously love to lose the weight and fix the physique without making myself too large and bulky. 

I sometimes fantasize about sex as a female, sometimes as a male (mostly bottoming either way). 

I am not sure what people mean when they speak of thinking like a male or thinking like a female, I just try to think as logically as possible and doing see how my gender would affect that. 

Thank you!"
11_49,asktransgender,Reconnecting with past friends,"So a little background on me, I came out shortly before grade 7 and my school was extremely unsupportive. They told me I wasn't allowed to tell my classmates that I'm trans.

Eventually, I transferred schools. At my new school, I didn't tell anyone I was trans. I cut off all contact with my friends from the old school (I never did tell them I'm trans) and began living almost completely stealth.

Fast forward 5 years and now I'm a first-year university student. I've legally changed my name and gender marker. I've been on T for 1.5 years and no one on campus knows I'm trans.

Last week, I ran into one of my friends from my old school. He didn't recognise me but I recognised him. Later, I sent him a message on Facebook asking if he wanted to meet up and he agreed. We had a great time hanging out and reconnecting.

He also told me that a lot of our old classmates were here at the university as well. There's a part of me that really wants to reconnect with them but there's also a part of me that wants to bury the past and forget about it. I look completely different than I did back in grade 7. In fact, the friend that I met up with didn't recognise me until a yelled his full name across the room. If I introduced myself with my new name, he'd have no idea that we were once best friends.

**TL;DR I'm completely stealth at university and I don't want people knowing I'm trans. But, I also want to reconnect with past friends.**

Any advice would be appreciated."

eggowafflewithbacon,asktransgender,Grandparents don't respect pronouns and name?,"Hi, I'm 17, will be 18 in November. MtF transgender, haven't started hormones, but am pretty passable in face and voice. 

So, my paternal grandparents aren't old. Grandmother is 59, grandfather is 65. They've always been very accepting and progressive, especially since my uncle is gay. I'm able to bring up the fact that I'm trans casually to them, But today I made a little joke about it and my grandmother says ""You'll always be a boy to me."". 

I know she wasn't doing it to hurt my feelings, but they've always been the ""stay out of it"" type when it comes to things. When I came out broadly, it was with a Facebook status, and my grandparents said they love me, but that I shouldn't put things like that on Facebook because ""there are a lot of weirdos out there."". I know where they're coming from, but even so, it just hurts. 

I'll probably start hormones when I'm 18. The rest of my family uses feminine pronouns, but are still adjusting to Jess, rather than Robert. Do you think my paternal grandparents will come around once I start hormones and such, or do you think it's something I'll just have to live with? I love them, they're great. This is the only thing they do that upsets me. 

I'm quite afraid to talk to them about it or correct them in fear that they'll blame it on ""spending too much time on that computer"" or ""thinking too damn much."""

I just wanted to share my experience at the very beginning of this. It was a crazy week, I felt serene calm after my first shot of estrogen and then a little up and down as my hormone levels battled it out.

I'm also on cyproterone acetate which has killed my morning business already and my nipples have been getting more sensation in them.

Most interestingly, though I still have dysphoria when I think about say the size of my body (189cm), however I feel very at ease with myself. I would say a significant amount of discomfort has subsided.

The Beard That Will Not Die is a big one.

But the one I'm thinking about now is work and the number of things I do for money.  I'm planning on quitting my sales job anyway - good riddance to that transphobic shithole.  But I've also got a few other ""minor"" jobs I do, involving public speaking and voice acting.  I've been voice acting (as a dude) for three years now; my entire portfolio is me doing dudevoice, I'm pretty good at it, and I've got a decent professional relationship with a few directors.  I get called in for an hour of recording about 1-3 times a month.  It's decent extra money and tons of fun and I really don't want to give this up.

Yeah, I know I could, theoretically, go into the studio en full femme and bust out my classic baritone.  But realistically, would it make me less of a transgirl if, on those occasions, I just put on my old dudeclothes, signed the check with deadname, and avoided getting asked any difficult questions? 

And, more importantly, would this sort of thing endanger my chances of getting my gender marker changed or getting recommended for surgery down the road?"

eliza_ok,asktransgender,The time I was kicked out of Victoria's Secret,"Long time lurker on this sub and I finally feel comfortable enough to share this story online.

This happened a few months ago when I went to the mall with a couple of friends. Take note that I am a 17 y/o mtf pre-everything who has never been into a Victoria's Secret ever. I planned for weeks to make this trip to the mall so I would be able to purchase my first bra without my parents finding out.

My friends, a 19 y/o gay man and 19 y/o straight girl, and I arrived at the mall at 10 in the morning just as it opened. This was I wouldn't be seen by too many people while carrying around a VS bag.

So we walked in (the plan was to get our female friend to buy it to avoid suspicion) and were immediately greeted by a SA. My friend explained to her that she wanted to purchase a bra and showed her the bra I picked out online. 

This is where things started to go not so well. Instead of showing her to the bra she asked for in the size she wanted, the SA proceeded to take out her measuring tape and grope my friend. At this point, the SA noticed my male friend and I standing there awkwardly and told us that we needed to leave. We tried to insist we should stay but she started shoo-ing us away and was starting to make a scene.

Long story short, we left and sat on the bench outside for about 45 minutes while this SA showed my female friend their entire selection of bras. I normally would've been really upset, but how could I be after getting my first bra?"
ThrowawayButNotTaken,asktransgender,Unsure about blood test results?,"I got the results of my blood test at the Mazzoni center back and talked to the doctor who would prescribe me HRT. One thing that was obvious from the results is that my testosterone was, for a pre-HRT amab, very low (128 ng/dl). Because of this, my doctor prescribed me Estradiol without an anti-androgen, as the Estradiol would probably lower my testosterone to female ranges anyway. He also said I should stop taking the bootleg Spironolactone I'd been taking, since my testosterone was already low and, according to him, taking Spironolactone unnecessarily can cause ""early breast bud fusing"" and hinder breast development.

However, I'm worried that the results of the blood test are unreliable. For one thing, the test was conducted around 5:30, and testosterone is lowest in the afternoon. Secondly, I had a large lunch literally an hour before I got the blood taken. This also lowers testosterone by a significant amount, apparently. Wouldn't it be possible that my testosterone is actually a lot higher than 128 ng/dl? If my testosterone is in normal male ranges and I'm not on an antiandrogen, that could cause masculinization and apparently makes the estrogen less effective.

I've already told my doctor this concern, so I'll get a reply within a couple days. But does anyone else have an opinion? Reassurance is always nice.

EDIT: The blood was taken before I started anything, bootleg or not. So that's the level without any antiandrogen."

I've been questioning my gender. During the day I'm happy to be a woman and much prefer to go by female pronouns but I'm not a girly-girl. Once in a while I enjoy wearing make-up but I dont like wearing dresses/skirts because I kind of feel like im being ""fake"" whenever i wear them. I feel most comfortable wearing jeans and my husband's t-shirts and hoodies.

Lately, during sex i think ive been feeling gender dysphoria or something because I get consumed by the thoughts of what it would be like to be a guy and I feel like my body isnt what its supposed to be. Basically, during sex i feel like I'm supposed to be a gay male... And the fact that I'm not makes me become turned off.

But when it comes to everyday life, I prefer to have my body the way it is, female. When i look in the mirror I like the way i look and when i walk around in public I feel proud of the body i have.

I'm not sure what to do about this. I feel like i want to stay ""female"" but i also want to be able to switch between male and female body-types in different situations. I'm not sure what to do about it and it's messing with my sex life and I feel like im becoming obsessed with my own confusion about my gender. I don't like sex anymore unless i close my eyes and pretend i have a male body or if i read a gay romance before sex.

My mind and my feelings often change . Some times I fell I deeply  like to be a girl. I see woman outhere, in the street or tv, and I instantly dreams that  I am her. Then I feel really bad, guilty and nervous.
I think in society, and its penalty…then I strive to think that I am a man. I try to forget  that feelings.
After a while, the female feelings desapears, but my mood is flat, with no hi moments or down moments, i live like a zombie. Then the woman feelings return.
Sometimes at work I think like men thinks, but when I am alone came that female feelings.
 I have told this to mi psychologist and she think may be I am transgender, but she thinks I can decrease the females feelings and to live normally like a man. Note: I have girlfriend.
The question is if anyone has experienced something like this: change between female mode or male mode, and what happened.

Thank you

beth_windlass,asktransgender,Having the progesterone conversation with my doctor,"I'm meeting with my doctor next week to have ""the conversation"" about starting progesterone. I have been on estrogen now for about six months, and I feel it's time to add the final ingredient to my hormonal mix. 

I'm a little unsure how to approach this conversation, both because I'm aware that he's resistant to prescribing it, and because trans patients are notoriously pushy about what they want from doctors and he seems a little jaded about that.

His reasons for being resistant are, I think, justified, and that's what is making me feel tentative about that conversation. Evidence that it has any physical effects at all are not conclusive, and it *is* known to cause more emotional unpredictability, which could be a mental health concern. But, first, if it's going to have any effects, I want those effects! And, second, I didn't get into this just for the positive stuff; I wholeheartedly embrace all aspects of my gender, even the stuff that's hard.

So I'm feeling a bit of trepidation about having this conversation. It's the typical ""I want to be a good patient who listens to her doctor and does what she's told"" vs. ""I want to advocate for myself and my health"" bind that I'm in.

Does anybody have suggestions for approaching this conversation that will have the result that I want without making me feel like a pushy bitch?"

bashfultransboi,asktransgender,I'm trans: help me be adult about it?,"Hi,

I'm a frequent lurker of r/asktransgender and every now and again I pipe in with a post. 

I'll be straightforward, I'm feeling very dejected, because my web searches about the subjects I'm about to mention didn't produce very fruitful-- let alone up to date-- results.Well, here goes:

I have to find my own insurance and soon, but I don't understand how to insurance shop, especially when I need a provider that recognizes gender affirmation/confirmation/reassignment surgery as medically necessary without some kind of bullshit stipulation (really, what the hell do people consider ""living 1-2 years as the gender identified with"", like what constitutes that? Are people not aware of some of the dangers being trans poses, especially when u don't pass? this is mostly case by case and all to do with where you live but its a real issue for me)

1. What is the best insurance for a transgender person?

2. How do I job search? Or start a career? I'm pre-op and was only on T for a month. My name isn't legally changed yet, but I can't stand to go by my deadname. And I HATE how people in the workplace who don't have any business knowing my legal name somehow know it. Total bullshit. Unprofessional. Counterproductive. We have lives we want to live, here!

3. Where is the best country to live as a trans person? Trans Utopia doesn't really exist, but I feel like living in America since birth has forced me to squelch my individuality because I'm scared of retaliation. I'm looking for a place that is open to people who express themselves outwardly. Yes, I'm poor, and I will be for some time, and surgery is definitely a loooooong way off, but if I could move somewhere more forgiving, then I would.

I don't like feeling stuck or sad anymore, and I'm tired of feeling like the forces are purposely making it hard for me to get answers. Can anyone offer an answer to these questions?

Sarah-RT,asktransgender,Anti androgens - psychological effects,"Hey everybody 

I often see people mentioning the effects of estrogen on the brain and how testosterone can cloud judgement in a sex haze etc etc

I've also Learned it's a ymmv kinda deal where some feel almost instant relief, others take several weeks and some are unsure but forge ahead anyway.

I was set to have an appointment with my psychologist over seeking anti androgens to get the ball rolling and take small steps but I had an emotional break down in front of my mom and instead went to my local doctor and got some anti anxiety/depression meds.
I cancelled the psychologist meeting as a result.

2-3 weeks later and the meds I got aren't helping, initially I think it might have been a bit placebo, hoping my mood swings and over thinking we're all anxiety based and things would get better but now I'm back to square one.

1 part of me wonders whether the dose is too low, I'm 6'4 and weight about 200 pounds so maybe they're not strong enough. On the other hand my issues revolve around an obsessive over thinking about my gender. 
I've returned to sleeping as female, today I bought some new clothes and earrings and stuff. I've tucked today again and I like the lack of anything up front and I'm half debating emailing my psychologist about the anti a's again. I was thinking about resuming counselling too but I feel I can't go back when I've one foot forward and one foot back and know nothing will get resolved.

Bit of a ramble there but back to the post title, are there any noticeable psychological changes from just anti androgens alone? I keep telling myself the only way I'll know if I'm trans is by taking estrogen, sort of a trial by fire situation, but if anti androgens can help resolve that at all I'd be eager to try them due to the minimal drawbacks in comparison to estrogen for someone unsure."

I feel like the worst person in the world.
I'm 29 currently female a few months ago after the need for an internal ultrasound and the statement ""you have beautiful ovaries"" I finally put finger my finger on what that feeling I was feeling my whole life about something being not quite right no matter how happy or sucessful i got i felt like a took a wrong turn that i wasnt where i should be wasnt that I wasnt where i should be it was im not who I should be I am a man. Queue emotional shit storm.

My husband and a few friends know.
I was married a year ago to the sweetest kindest most sensitive man Ive ever known and if i had known then what i know now i never would have.
There have always been indicators looking back in hind sight If i had put them all together in a thought process I would have figured it out allot sooner but they were all seperate things at the time.

When the idea was first articulated in my head ""maybe im trans"" I thought these feelings would go away so I tried to hide it but I was a giant ball of depression and anxiety and waiting for a psych appointment, I needed to get it out and so I wrote it all down in a journal he found it one day cleaning (little sus on this) he says hell support me and be by my side no matter what. We talk he is hurting so much what made him love me the most is my feminity. hes not gay, he has been in a relationship with a man based on the personality but could never follow through with the sex, If/when I transition I know one day it will get to the point where he wont be my husband even though he says to the contrary so i fight boy mode so much because hurting him is ripping me up inside and im taking away the thing he loves most and I can see my self stepping one day closer to being with out him. He says dive in so he can see if he can really do this but Im so overwhelmed by whats ahead combined with not knowing anyone who has been through this to ask advice so Im taking baby steps I dont want anyone else to find out before im ready before Ive reconciled this in my own head a bit more.
Part of me hopes Ill wake up tomorrow happy with my presebt state and I can tell him I was just a bit lost but part of me is so excited to start working on me to finally see me.
I try to tell myself I havent made a decision yet but plans are being made in my head with what information in my head. 

This is all so new for me too and not really having spoken to anyone that has been through just friends (still waiting for a psych appointment) I dont know enough to talk to him about it with conviction.

I want to let go I want to explore this I dont know how to start and be gentle and support him at the same time i need advise please?

Lemortjoyeux,asktransgender,How do medical professionals know the difference between gender non-conforming and trans children?,"There is a lot of information out there about how gender dysphoria is diagnosed but I can't find anything about how it is determined for children. I am not trans but had very confused feelings until my 20s because I was gender non conforming. Things have changed and there's a lot of new research out there. Consequently, transchildren have become the new hot topic so I'm interested in how they can tell the difference.

To me children are all over the place and even getting them to admit molestation can be difficult because there is so little about the world they understand. So how can they tell with children as young as 4? 

A related question is I've read that gender identity is formed around 2-3 years old but at that age things like mental illness and developmental problems are very difficult to diagnose because children can't express themselves properly. Did they figure this out only through interviews or there's physical evidence to support this? I've looked for research involving brain scans but only find unreliable or solely psychological research."

My main problem is I have no clue what to expect. Iv'e seen many sites say it is 100% risk free yet ive seen some people say it made there voice worse or that it didn't change at all.

So what I wan't to know is there a surgery (or a set or something) that I  can do that will pitch up my voice and change my resonance with little to no risk? Additionally are there any in America that I could go to since that is my home country.

Side Notes:
I could be mute and I wouldn't mind, I just can't deal with the voice I have, so a little risk on a surgery is OK

I have a voice currently describable as a cartoon stereotypical gay man.

The main reason it is so important to me right now is I wan't to make a lets play channel on youtube, but I don't feel confident with my voice. Post surgery I'd either have the voice I wan't and be able to do my channel, or I'd be mute and just edit for someone who want's to do youtube, or id have a lower pitched voice which idk if I could live with.

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,How to convince my GP of doing a blood test on hormones?,"Hi there

I went to my GP today and said that I want my body checked. Pancreas, liver, kidneys, hormones, food intolerance, allergies, etc.

She said that the insurance demands a valid reason for doing that, otherwise they won't pay anything. Those tests are pretty expensive, though. Getting blood from me, packaging that stuff abacterial, transporting it to the next lab, getting it analysed, etc. Without insurance that would make me poor. That makes me dependant on her labelling it as necessary.

She told me that she can get my pancreas checked, because I'm underweight. However, she doesn't do that with anything else. I explicitly asked for hormones, but she refused and said that that's only for women who have issues with menstruation or pregnancy. For protocol: I'm pre-everything, boy-mode, and closeted.

Do you know of any *""valid""* reason why a *""teenage boy""* would have to get *""his""* hormones checked?

Outing myself isn't really an option, though... She wouldn't treat me poorly, because she knows that I would report her, which might cost her her license. She also wouldn't tell anybody, because breaking patient confidentiality would cost her her license too. It's more that outing myself would obviously get me into the transgender-treatment-system, which is horribly outdated, restrictive and outright inhumane. In that system, GPs also can't really help me with treatment related to transgender.

Well, outing myself *could* help. If she's really accepting and supportive *(which I don't know)*, then she might make up a reason for it... That could get her into trouble, though. There's also no guarantee that she'd actually do that.

For clarification... I can't transition yet, and have to wait until I can move out of this bigoted shithole. I want to use the time as good as possible. Knowing my hormone levels would be one of those things. 

---

**TL;DR:** Doctor needs valid reason to check my hormone levels. She thinks there's no valid reason in my case. Outing myself wouldn't hardly have any positive effect.

Anyways, I guess my voice is okay. Maybe I don't actually need Yeson. For speaking.

I've always really wanted to sing, though... For years, I've turned up the volume on my speakers as loud as I can, and sung along to everything... I love the feeling of singing, but I hate the sound of my horrible singing voice. 

Even if my speaking voice is passable, it's in the lower range for a female. My singing voice isn't even that. It sounds like a man doing falsetto, at best, and if I try to go higher, it sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks. 

How can I sing like a girl? I want this so bad... Even if my speaking voice gets perfect, I'd go to Yeson just to be able to sing. Help please?

I guess part of why my speaking voice is so good is because my inflection is really natural (didn't even have to practice it), but that doesn't really come across so much in songs, so that's why it falls apart, I think. What can I do? Thanks for any help, love y'all &lt;3"

Its constant verbal abuse (you're not a boy, you're lying to yourself, you're confused, you don't have to be so 'in your face' about it, the reason they dont like you anymore is because you came out), and when shes not criticizing, shes ignoring me. Recently my mum refused to go to the grocery store with me b/c I had a binder and a plaid shirt on (i still looked female in that) so I went another day (4 days in total) without toothpaste or shampoo.
Shes going behind my back and talking to family members about how awful I am, but not giving the reason that I do things (like cutting my hair- she wouldnt let me get a proper cut) and wont tell them I'm trans because she's embarrassed. And now im too scared to come out because she's turning them against me. Idek what to do anymore.
I turn 15 in a few months. Hopefully i can get emancipated then, but I'm not allowed to get a job (thanks mum) so probly not."

dasoktopus,asktransgender,Bicalutamide without estrogent to gently demasculinize?,"I'll start by saying this is my first time posting here. I identify as genderqueer/genderfluid. I am a boy and have considered some form of hormone therapy to reduce some masculine traits of mine.

In a perfect world, I'd be able to reduce body and facial hair, smooth out the muscle mass and maybe have a little bit more softer curve in my body. I do not want breast growth OR any changes in sexual function or my genitals. I want to remain a cis-passing attractive male, just more feminine so that I can more easily move across the spectrum when I feel like it. I know this is probably impossible, so I'll settle with the closest option. 

I've looked into Bicalutamide (casodex) because it seems pretty safe and effective. But I would be taking it without estrogen (obviously). I dont want to self medicate so I plan on seeing a trans-friendly endo soon, but that costs a lot of money, so I want to make sure Im making a good decision. 


I've scoured the web for resources as well as Reddit threads so I'm wondering if there's any updates now, and if anyones familiar with my specific situation?"
1lea8,asktransgender,Details about life pre transition,"Hi everybody!
I'm mtf and 8 years ago (before I was aware of who I was) I begun to write a story about a man who takes home a doll (like the one in window shop) he finds in garbage. He starts to dress her, do her make up, talk to her and he freaks out when she begins to answer him and move. Bottom line: she comes to life while he slowly stop being alive. At the end she carries him to the garbage where he first found her. I was thinking long I was talking about capitalism (ha ha) with this story untill I realized who I was. Now I know what's the point (a metaphore for transition) I decide to rewrite the story.

Anyway I need to find a lot of detail to make my character exist and looking in my past I found a lot of things which are not in anyway direct sign I was transgender but afterall I could say were logical like:
Don't take care of my body or how I used to dress, eat my nails, draw female figure like an obsession, don't care what I ate (always the same junk food), feeling strange in front of a mirror, drink and doing drugs, beeing depressive... 
Sory if it sounds a little to much like a stereotype but it's true :)

I need to gather some of this little things that are possible to show on film (thoughts and idears are off topic). My experience was a good start but I would need more details like this. Can you remember some of these details pre transition that you can now say: of course! That was why I was like this!

Thanks in advance for all of you willing to help me finishing this story :)"

snapbackstevonnie,asktransgender,I'm coming out to my parents within the next few months. What should I write in my coming out email?,"I'm a 19-year-old college student looking to come out to her parents as trans within the next few months. I've already decided that I'm going to come out via email, so I can write exactly what I want to say ahead of time and provide them with a list of resources.    
    
We live in Massachusetts, a very liberal state, and both of my parents are liberal. From the little I've seen them exposed to trans issues, neither of them seem transphobic. Neither of them are religious. I'm unlikely to face abuse, financial troubles, or suggestions of conversion therapy from them. I expect them to be accepting but will prepare if they're not.    
    
I'm starting the first draft of my coming out email next week. However, I'm not entirely sure on what to include. My basic outline so far is:    
    
* I'm trans. In my case, this means that I am a girl who was assigned male at birth and has spent her life uncomfortable with the roles and expectations that come with that.
* I've been discovering this about myself for the last 4 years, doing extensive research on trans terminology and issues. However, I have felt this way all my life. I just didn't have the terms to describe it.
* I would prefer for you to call me [name] and use [these pronouns] when referring to me.
* The best thing for me would be to consult a gender therapist who will be able to help me work out the rest of my feelings and write a recommendation for HRT for me.
* I don't want anybody else to know until I am ready to tell them. You can forward this email to [my brothers], but that's it. Not my roommate, not our extended family, not your friends or coworkers. This is important to me and I want to handle it in my own way.
* I've included a list of resources which you can review before responding. They'll answer some of the questions you might have and help you collect your thoughts about this. If you have any more questions, I'm open to answering them.
* Thank you for listening to me. I hope you're doing well.

Some things I'm anxious about concerning the letter:    
    
* I'm a nonbinary girl (my pronouns are she/her or they/them), but I'm not sure if I want to come out as such. Will it downplay the rest of my coming out if they don't see me as ""fully"" transgender? I don't know how they feel about nonbinary identities. I'm sure they're willing to learn, but I don't want to complicate things too much.
* Do I cover all the topics that they might want to know about?    
* Do y'all have any more resources I could link them, or are the ones I have now enough?    
    
Sorry that this is long, I just really want to get this right. I have a few months to prepare and no definite date when I want to tell them. I just want to have time for them to understand and maybe to start a transition before next Coming Out Day, when I plan on publicly coming out."
Voiceproblems,asktransgender,"Maybe I'll get more responses on this subreddit, but it hurts to talk in my girl voice after having practiced/used that voice for nearly a year (MTF)","I've posted this to /r/transvoice several times, but I never get any useful help.

TuffTuffy,asktransgender,Confusion Phase No. 2?,"So, uh... What now?

I came out to another friend of mine. Unlike my BFF, he was... not as accepting. He said something like:
""I have question
If you are a girl
Then why do you dress like a boy
Act like a boy
Live like a boy
God made you a boy so there is nothing you can change about it its a truth""
It's his opinion, and even though I think it's wrong, I respect him. But it got me thinking. Am I really transgender? Indicators are mixed, and that's what confuses me alot.

Things that indicate I'm transgender:

  *I am uncomfortable with my male body (Penis, deep voice, hurrendous sweat smell, muscles, belly fat...) and would love to have a female body.

  *I would fucking smash the magic gender/sex changing button. No second thought. Nu-uh.

  *I want to dress up like a girl, do my nails, apply some makeup, wear high heels (real big sucker for those), go shopping..

Things that show me the opposite:

  *I have more male friends than female friends. 

  *I have never acted girly/too girly, despite having several urges to dress up like a girl secretly.

  *I remember that one time when I was 2.5 years old, and my sister and our friends dressed me up as a girl for a small play in front of our parents. I didn't want to go act like that, but I don't think I disliked the feeling, either.

Questioning250,asktransgender,How would you describe my sexuality?,"(20yo AMAB questioning) Here's a summary of my sexuality/sexual fantasies since puberty:

Since puberty all I've ever been turned on by are ""Crossdreaming"" fantasies and imagining I'm female. This includes transformation fantasies, tg captions, sissy porn and just regular vanilla porn were I'm either the female or a transwoman. 

I feel like I don't have much desire to have sex as a guy but as a girl I would enjoy sex w/ both guys and girls. My fantasies focus mainly on myself having a female body. The good majority of my fantasies consist of having sex w/ guys as a girl. However I have no interest in sex w/ them as a guy and don't feel I'm actually sexually attracted to them. They're often faceless and imagining kissing/fucking them is equivalent to imagining kissing/fucking a wall tbh. Guys are often props in my fantasies. In lesbian fantasies though in addition to the focus of being female I DO focus on my female partner and love the idea of making out. I'm just attracted to the female form in general.

Due to these fantasies and the lack of any others, I have a pretty strong desire to transition just at least for the sexual reasons alone. I essentially feel I have a female sexual identity. How would you describe this? Is it a fetish or something more?"
nocimus,asktransgender,Should I talk to my normal psychiatrist about gender issues / concerns?,"Basically the title.  I see a psychiatrist for therapy and medication related to GAD and major depressive disorder.  She specializes in that area, as well as a handful of other non-gender related areas.  Is it worth it to talk to her about my concerns about my gender identity, or should I find a therapist who specializes in gender therapy?

I do like my psychiatrist, but I am also uncertain about how she (a religious woman who hasn't seemed to have any prejudices about what we've talked about before) will react to my concerns.

What does /r/asktransgender have to say about this situation?"
rplesti,asktransgender,Am I beyond redemption?,"This post is more positive than it will sound at first.  I don't know why I've written this.  I guess I'm just bored and like crystallizing my thoughts in writing.

I'm in about the worst place I've been in my life.  Good financial security, but my will to do anything, communicate with anyone in particular, even believe in anything.. has nearly dried up.  10 years ago (age 20 or so), I was wild and free and pursuing transition (mtf), and I was very happy, feminine, in great shape, and surrounded by great people.  But I had no economic support beyond my self, and have to earn every penny I spend in a very unforgiving world.  The weight of economic instability became too much.  

I went back to school in my home state as my old identity, and eventually got a very good job (again as my old identity).  Though I'm mtf, I'm actually quite good at being ""manly"" in some strange masochistic way.  I think I was supposed to be a reeeally butch lesbian.  My super power is doubling down on things that are unpleasant to me to come out ahead.  At least it was; it's like I've been burning my soul for energy since that time and now it's nearly gone.  I'm in terrible shape, hardly communicate with anyone, and ""self-medicate"" to the point of harm.

I've made my body into a great, reliable vehicle aimed down the road of a long life that traditionally makes people happy with no more road blocks.  I'm at the finish line of the economic rat race; I've won.  But instead, it's like a body-horror bit where the actor looks down and is horrified to discover that he's transformed into something inanimate from the neck down.  I have another decade of testosterone soaked into my bones, I've amputated parts of my mind that hold a man back, and developed a bitterness for some common aspects of humanity.  Even before, I'd forsaken the idea that I could be happy with a normal life.  Why did I try to pursue one?

For over a year now I've been meaning to whip myself back in shape, start transition again, and ultimately reconnect to whatever spiritual source that created vast reserves of indomitable energy in me before.  But I'm concerned that my abuse of myself has created too much scar tissue to recover from.

This is where my first sentence comes in.  I'm going to do it.  The question in the title isn't me asking you.  It's the question that's going to be answered by my newfound resolve.  I'm a little optimistic about it.  My mind has proven to be incredibly plastic in the past and might not be beyond healing and re-feminization.  I'm not so fixated on normality that I can't appreciate my trans heritage - it's shown me a greater breadth of the human condition than may be attainable otherwise.  Doing some years of DIY hormones before puberty ended might also help me out a bit.  Maybe having done it this way is getting the best of both worlds: economic stability and my freedom.

But I should probably have taken at least low-level HRT more in this time.

This is asktransgender after all, so my actual question is: do I even sound remotely relatable anymore, or have my experiences driven me mad?

ThrowawayButNotTaken,asktransgender,Laser Hair Removal suggestions?,"Hi. I've been on E and spironolactone for about a month now, and I want to look into starting laser hair removal. I have pale skin and dark hair, so it works out for me. However, there's two things I'm confused about:


1. My friend (who is also a transwoman) said that I should look for places that other transwomen have had good results from. However, I can't find any transwomen's testimonials for any places around here (Princeton NJ area). How important is it to go somewhere other transwomen have had good results, and where can I find testimonials if it's important?

2. I'm going back to school in Baltimore in three months. Obviously, this means I'd have to change my laser place. How does this affect my plans?"
pm_me_nice_cats_idk,asktransgender,Accidentally gendered correctly by my mother,"So this happened yesterday. I'm a long time lurker on this sub and every now and then a comment or two but this made me so unreasonably happy that I had to share it with you all. I'm a transmale and I'm only in my late teens but I'm out to a few select people in my family. It took a lot for me to come out to those people (god mother, mother, brother to name a few) and I've been too afraid to work up to telling the rest just yet, even though I know I'm lucky enough to be in a very liberal family that won't care either way.
Anyway, we got a surprise visit from two of these unknowing relatives yesterday. We were all chatting in the kitchen when my mother brought up my artwork, just casual chit chat. Then she referred to me as 'him' and quicky stammered 'her' really quickly to cover herself. Keep in mind my mother has accepted it all, it was just that these relatives didn't know yet. Mum went bright pink for a few minutes but my relatives didn't pick up on anything, probably just thought it was a random slip of the tongue. But I was beaming.
Even though mum supports me, things arent perfect and I havent asked her to switch to my male name or male pronouns yet. I have a little sister who cant know for a completely different reason that I won't delve into here. So for mum to accidentally gender me correctly just made my day. I think the fact that it was by accident makes it better, since it means she must at least see me more and more as male now than just a begrudging ""my child wants me to so I must"" if it was on purpose. Just thought I'd share a little positivity with you all :)"
FUNKYIMPACT,asktransgender,I suppose input on this situation would help.,"I haven't worn my binder in a long time due to it being such an inconvenience at work, and the demands from work. I really, really *really* would love to wear it more since my dysphoria with my body has been getting bad lately as well as my mental health plummeting, yet putting it on is a huge problem for me.

I ride public transportation, and my commute to work is about an hour or so. I want to avoid wearing my binder for more than eight hours, so what I do is that I pack my binder with me and whenever I get the time to do it during my break, I simply run to the restroom and into the handicap stall and quickly change into it. I'm at 5 minutes now from no binder to binder.

Sometimes, however, that's a problem. It's been getting busier at work, and I avoid trying to go in there when there's other people. And sometimes there's somebody else in the stall, and it's super awkward to wait when it's the only one you can and have to use. And sometimes people take a long time in there.

I just want to wear my damn binder more. It shouldn't have to be this big of an issue."

strawbarry92,asktransgender,"I have a friend who I strongly suspect is trans, and very much in denial. I'm going to come out to him soon, should I talk to him about it?","So a couple years ago my friend A was drunk and told me and a couple other friends that he always wished he was a girl and watched transformation porn/hentai. (We were drinking and talking about dirty secrets at the time.) He basically has the most stereotypical trans narrative; thought he was a girl as a child and had unsupportive parents who forbade him from participating in girly pursuits with his sisters, and ""manned up"" from then on. 

During his drunken confession, he said he's come to terms with being a boy, mostly because he's OK living that way and worries what his parents would think. We (almost all queer, my friends) said that he should really explore his femininity, this sounds like he's trans etc. etc. but he STRONGLY denied that it was a big deal, just a personal quirk and that ""he's a guy now, totally fine.""
(Even though he still watches transition porn? OOOOOK)

After this confession I started really questioning my own gender, as I had my own dysphoria about being AFAB for a while. I had a bit of a private breakdown, just hearing someone else talk about such similar experiences to my own really brought my feelings into light. 

A is an escapist. Always moving around, never staying put. He has very few personal items, doesn't really care that much about how he looks. Randomly shaves his head after a lot of hair growth and grows a beard, then shaves it and grows his hair out again. People think he's gay, he hates it because he likes girls. Except for that time he told me he went down on a guy, which he really didn't like. I asked him if in his imagination he was a woman going down on a guy, which I got a furtive ""...yes..."" to in response. (Called it.) I then asked him about his gender identity, which he denied again and claimed he really was comfortable being a guy. A is an olympic level mental gymnast, I tell you what. He walks like a girl, talks like a girl, dances like a girl, sits in a chair like a girl, makes friends primarily with girls, has a computer decorated in pink, girly stickers he got in Japan... I just want to scream at him that he is a girl. But I can't tell him that? Or can I? Do I have a right to do that?

So now I have come to terms with my own gender identity, and am ready to come out as trans to my friends. I really want to tell A, because I really just want to talk to him about our shared experience. But he is abroad in an program overseas, cloistered away in a very remote location. (with spotty wifi, which is how I can reach him.) I'm worried I'm going to send him into crisis mode, like he did to me back a couple of years ago. (Overall it helped me though haha) 

I don't think he understands that his dysphoria isn't going away, if he's been like this his whole life. His hairline is starting to recede, but he's very petite and short so he's got that going. I guess I just want him to wake up to his own personal truth, like I have because it feels so good and I want to meet the real A. He has a deep sadness in his eyes when he's not telling jokes, I believe he needs to be a woman, or something closer to one. (I MAY be wrong, but only he knows, when it comes down to it.) 

Should I tell him my thoughts? Or should I just come out to him and let him talk to me about it when he's ready?

MoreNMoreLikelyTrans,asktransgender,I need an outside perspective.,"Its 3:24 am. My sister is having a baby (c-section) in about 4 hours.  I've spent the past few days indulging again in wearing my girl clothes and reading this subreddit. Specifically I was reading one of the many ""Am I not transgender because I feel fine now"" threads the gets posted here.  And all I can feel/say/think is ""Fuck."" More specifically. ""Fuck, this is not going away.""
[](/sp)

I feel ashamed.  For many reasons.  I've always pulled myself towards groups.  And wanted to be ""in"" them.  Whether its youtube minecraft server communities. Or streaming communities.  Or the new Youtube media. Or what have you.  I've always wanted to ""be apart of X"" because then maybe I'll feel fulfilled and happy. 
[](/sp)

I've discussed this with a few therapists, and most have suggested its a sign of ""slight"" Narcissism. 
[](/sp)

So I end up feeling like this is just another sign of that.  
[](/sp)

But then I remember how, in Jr. High late after school, during rehearsal of the school play, the costumes were in the hall RIGHT by the bathrooms.  I saw a dress, and grabbed it and rushed into the bathroom and tried it on.   To my sadness, it didn't fit.  I remember feeling sad and stupid about this. And super embarrassed if someone was in the hall when I took it back to the rack it was hanging on. 
[](/sp) 

I then remember a BUNCH of other instances similar to this.  Specifically, right now, when I told my first serious girl friend, when we were having problems, that I wanted to be a girl.  And while I had said it amid a passive aggressive fight, I remember saying it sincerely. I remember feeling a twinge of happiness when she said that it wouldn't matter.  
[](/sp)
[](/sp)

I'm fat, I'm depressed, I have no self confidence, I feel like I'm lying to my self when I say I want to be a girl because its just being ""part of a group"".  I feel sad and depressed about all this complication and confusion.  Which ultimately leads me to believe I am just not willing to accept my trans self.  I've never felt dysphoria, except recently about my hairy chest, and then I don't even know if its dysphoria since it just feels like ""meh, that looks bad"".  I know there is no answer to the question ""Am I trans because XYZ"".  But this shit is depressingly complicated. An enigma of confusion.

catfusion,asktransgender,Hormonal 'crazies' when starting HRT?,"So this is an acknowledged and known thing. 

(To the point that it seems a lot of people just assume it *will* happen, and warn someone starting HRT 'get ready for the mood swings' etc...)

I *didn't* experience enough of this* for myself or anyone else to remark on it though. For reasons, I'm kind of expected to know about this and be able to relate some information about this to other people, so for those of us who *did* find that ""HRT made me crazy"" 
('crazy' how? emotional? moody? Seriously, elucidate me.) 
when they started, can you share a little of that experience, and ideally, any advice you wish others had had when interacting with you during that time?

Zedkloe,asktransgender,Wanting to come out to my uncle but he's avoiding the conversation,"Hey guys, I just want to first say without this community and all these posts with the support from everyone I'd be lost. I don't post much but when I do I try to be helpful and supportive because this subreddit has been a big help for me, so thank you! Ok so I came out to my uncle and cousin as bisexual back in March I think it was. I had been suppressing it for over 10 years since first trying to express myself in highschool. Coming out and finally letting it out helped me come to realize it was more than just sexuality and looking back at all my issues with depression since puberty pointed to gender dysphoria. I live with my uncle and have told him since I came out that it might be more than just my sexuality, that I wanted to present and express myself femininely so I have been wearing female clothes everywhere except work. We used to go do errands together and he now refuses to go out in public with me because he's worried what other people would think. He says it's a small town and the way I dress makes him uncomfortable. I mean, I'm not wearing dresses, I'm wearing tight pants and shirts and cute boots, I don't see the problem but either way he's uncomfortable. I told him that I've been dressing this way because it gives me relief from from anxiety and depression and I will do anything to alleviate that pain because the meds never worked for me. (I went through 4 difference antidepressants and 2 different ADD pills). I told him I've been wanting to express myself this way for a longggg time and never explored it because I was worried about making people feel uncomfortable. He told me not to let other people make me feel uncomfortable because they might be uncomfortable and not to let that change me or prevent me from doing things. I told him I was going to go to therapy and hopefully figure everything out. A couple months later and he asked me how therapy is going and I told him really well, I'm figuring a lot of thjngs out, and my assumptions are becoming concrete and he responds with ""I'm an ostrich with my head in the ground, I don't want to know, I just want to know you're feeling better"". I want to come out to him and educate him because I feel like he cares and he's worried about my health but I feel like he just doesn't know and doesn't want to hear it. He's planning on selling the house and before I present femininely he offered me a room at his new place(last I heard he was selling in the spring but we haven't talked about it for a long time and I'm worried he's too uncomfortable to still give me that offer). I'm worried about wear I'm going to live. I'm worried about losing him because before I was experimenting he's been the closest thing to a father figure I've ever had in my life.(long story short, mother, his sister, passed away, I got kicked out of the house by my step dad and he sold the house, took all the money and gave up on me. I moved half way across the country to live with my uncle.) This format and paragraph structure is a mess and apologize, I'm on my phone and trying to get it all out on the page. What do I do? What can I tell him? My therapist really thinks he needs to know as soon as possible to help me figure out my living situation as it might change in less than 6 months."

So, first off. 

1) Do you girls who take HRT have to take HRT for the rest of your lives, or is it only for a short period of time within your life that you need to take it? What happens if you stop taking it.

2) How do you take all of these treatments, is it daily with pills or a patch? 

3) Do you just take an estrogen pill/patch or do you have to keep taking specific ones like ""estradiol"" and then move onto different estrogen meds?

4) The anti-testosterone medication, do you have to keep taking that as well, or do you only need to take it for a few years?

5) Eh, last question.. Bit different from the rest. Is your sex drive like men, or are you more lady like when it comes to being dirty minded now?

Thanks!

[deleted],asktransgender,Deleting My Account Because of A Stalker - A Warning to other Trans* individuals about posting pictures of yourself online.,"Hey everyone, I'm Amy. It's been awhile since I've posted here. So to update, my transition has been going extremely well and I finally pass visually.

Anyway, for the past month a stalker on reddit has been messaging me relentlessly on here. They're obviously very very mentally ill, but they've taken it too far. They have used my pictures and reddit posts to find out where I'm from, and have gotten in contact with one of my good friends to get information more about me. My friend contacted me yesterday that he woke up to 23 messages on Kik from this person stalking me. They were asking for very personal details about my life, and were saying they're in love with me. 

Here are some of the messages I've received. 

http://imgur.com/a/CtHc3 (These aren't even all the messages, there are like 20 others)

I replied only to the ones threatening suicide. Telling them that it'll get better, but that they need to leave me alone and get help. Thankfully they're from Eastern Europe instead of the USA, so I'm pretty safe from them finding me. They were aggressive because I wasn't responding to the point that they scared me. Finding my friend was the last straw. They scared my friend as well. 

Anyway, to all the other trans* individuals on here, this is a warning about posting pictures of yourselves on reddit. I've made my social media ultra private because this isn't the first time this has happened. 

I love you all, and I'll still be around but with a different username. It's time to get rid of this account anyway since it has my deadname in it. Bye everyone! /u/adam817 is no more!

katiecakesss,asktransgender,"on my way to greater vancouver, getting my first apartment in washington state.","hello /r/asktransgender !!

i'm really trying to get to canada. specifically bc.

&gt; **some backstory:**

&gt; i'm both a german and an american citizen. i'm 18 and i graduated high school in italy, then flew with my parents to kansas about half a year ago. i do not like it here. i've always wanted to live in canada and become a canadian. i've generally had really bad experiences living in america (and with the us military environment) and i'd much rather use my german passport to get around. i know quite a few people in bc (including trans people!!) and they love it. also, unlike kansas, it's a fairly progressive area. i think i'd feel generally safer being trans in greater vancouver than i would on an army base in kansas.
&gt; 
&gt; i won't go into it but my parents are very abusive, which is why i need to move out. my father was a drill sergeant. i live in fort leavenworth and almost never leave base (where chelsea manning is being held at the USDB. i've been there, and people on base like to misgender her on purpose &amp; say bad stuff), my parents won't ""let me be trans"", i'm awkwardly half-out of the closet (i said the ex-gay therapy worked to get them to tone down), and i'm 2 months on hrt (i hide my hormones in my computer) but fully presenting as male (changes in my breasts are getting harder to hide and i can't wake up shirtless anymore). my father has thrown a fit before where he threw away some of my belongings. nobody irl knows about any of this but my doctor, and they only know that i'm on hrt. i got a po box to hide this just in case i get any mail from them. not once have i ever presented as female in person.
&gt; 
&gt; i went through ex-gay therapy throughout high school with navy chaplains on a us navy base in italy. i've made various vent posts about this on reddit with various accounts spanning about four years. i've attempted to run away from them three times.
&gt; 
&gt; i don't think i like the us military.
&gt; 
&gt; i have to hide every facet of my life from them. i dropped out of college last week in order to work longer hours at my fast food job so i can move out asap, which they don't know yet (i take a 1 hour break at home like i did in school &amp; have extra uniforms in my car that i wash at the laundromat, all to make them think i'm still in school). if they found out i quit college (and i want to be an arts major), i'd be homeless. they don't want me moving out (they don't know i'm trying to get into canada) so they hid both of my passports (which i need to take my ielts). they will not let me have access to them. i asked and they both got pissed and had a long talk with me. i don't feel safe here at all. i am going to cut ties with them. they've done some traumatizing shit that i may never forget.

**ok**

i can make an american passport via mail (which would take a long time and cost a lot of $ plus i'd have to report my parents for theft, i've been through the process and i canceled out last minute) but i'd have to fly to chicago to get a new german one (i contacted my consulate general to verify this). i'm coming into canada with my german documents. i'm putting it on hold.

i'm doing this all by car, stopping at major cities and sleeping in whatever motel i can find.

so, my plan is to move to washington state (near bc, away from family, not as bad as kansas), get a new us passport via mail, fly to the german consulate in san francisco to get a new passport (with my new american passport), take my ielts, get a visa + work permit, move/get permanent residence in canada, renounce my us citizenship, and once time permits, apply for citizenship.

i'm moving to washington state in 33 days. and i'm never coming back to kansas. nobody knows this. i'm looking at apartments but i've never i pay my own bills, but i've never lived on my own before. i don't want to be stuck having to pay rent on a lease for a year (wanting to move to bc), i just need somewhere to not be homeless while i get my passports back and until i get into canada. what do i do?

also, i need to know what documents to bring and keep safe in a file cabinet as well (birth certificate, car title, etc), since my parents are hiding some of those (like my passport). i need to know what i absolutely need to keep.

i'm honestly a little scared to have roommates, but that might just be what i have to do. i'll probably have to room with men and continue to present as male/use my deadname. i'm just scared of how they'll treat me as a trans person. i don't trust anybody here and i don't know if people will be the same in washington. if i want something below $700 (working minimum wage and making car payments), i'm gonna have to have roommates. [have a look.](http://www.apartments.com/under-700/?bb=g4xt4r4imRt71wwwoM)

**so i got $550 now and i'm expecting to have $1500 by thanksgiving. i want to move out of an abusive household and a conservative state as soon as i have the money, but i want an apartment where i can leave anytime to move to british columbia once i have my documents to get into canada. what do i do?**

1. No more random erections or morning wood.
2. My face seems to be more pale.
3. My body odor smells really different.

Things that I have not experienced yet are:

1. That ""calm"" state of mind people always mention.
2. No tingly sensation in my chest that I'm patiently waiting for.
3. No swings in my mood or peaks of emotion.
4. A sharp reduction in my libido (though I'm glad to still have it).
5. No vivid sense of color or whatever it is they say about seeing more color.

I have yet to take my measurements, though I'm sure I've only lost in some places due to succesfully being on a 2000 calorie diet for over a month (I have a to credit another medication for that though).

I am having diarrhea and heartburn too, but none of my symptoms seem to be painful or as concerning as typical symptoms for either men or women. Can't tell if this is cause of a really stressful past month or if these are signs of something more sinister. I am only 18, but I am overweight and drink tons of caffiene (monster, coffee, tea) and going through the early stages of transition and college stuff makes me concerned.

I'm curious about how you folks have experienced dating in either country and regardless of the extent of your transition and ""passibility"". What's it like finding authentic, accepting guys? How dangerous has it been in general?"
EvilLucy,asktransgender,DAE have fits of rage pre-HRT?,"First, I want to say thank you to this community for existing. I'm a long time lurker since I've started questioning, but getting to read how other people feel on here has helped me realize that I do want to transition, so thank you for that, you all helped get me there. 

I plan on starting HRT soon (by early December), but since coming out to myself, while I do feel a sense of peace about how I wish to start living (yay!), I also find myself freaking out much more lately about admittedly stupid and clearly unrelated things. I guess my real question is how do I put up with the frustration of simply having to ""just wait""? I know it's pointless to worry about it, and that 6 more weeks isn't going to kill me, but I can't seem to get my mind off of it. 

Any advice?"

I eventually gave up on this though as of course nothing came of it. Someone on here said the DSM would consider it gender dysphoria. Would that have been considered gender dysphoria by the DSM?"

spicapirate,asktransgender,"How do I get over the fear of coming out to someone, even when I know they will likely accept me?","Hi. I’m Ron and I’ve been questioning (or more precisely, in denial because of internalised misandry and transphobia) my gender for the past three years. It’s been a roller coaster for me, but I’ve finally managed to accept that I’m a transgender guy and that these feelings are not a phase. 

My problem is that I really want to come out to my sister. She is my closest person, and and I’m bothered that I’m hiding this part of myself from her. I’m mentally ill and in order to get better, I need to learn to trust other people and tell them how I feel, and I can’t do that if I’m hiding my real gender from the person I trust the most.

The thing is, my sister is bisexual, and I know she is not transphobic. She is one of the most accepting people I know, in fact, so I believe that she will be supportive. I'm aware I’m really lucky to have a family member this awesome, and that many trans people don’t have it as good as I do. But still, even when I know that, I’m still scared and no matter how many times I decide that “today I’m going to do it!” I end up freaking out and not doing it.

More than anything, I’m afraid she will start seeing me and treating me differently than before. I know she will keep it a secret (she’s been helping me hide my sexuality from our parents for five years), but I really don’t want her to change the way she acts around me. I just don’t want to have to hide the real me anymore. And I know it will go well, when I look at my situation rationally, but the emotional seems to have decided that it won't.

I know this fear makes no sense, since she’s never been mean to me, or ever rejected me for being different, but I still can’t shake the negative thoughts. 

So, what I want to ask is if anyone else has been in a situation where they knew their coming out would be received well, yet they still were afraid? And how to get over this fear and come out to said person? Or if you have any positive coming out stories or advice in general, I welcome it all.  I’m just kind of scared right now, and need some words of affirmation."

SailorEmma,asktransgender,"So, coming out to my parents went awfully...","On Wednesday of last week, I decided that I'd had enough of keeping my gender identity to myself, so I planned to finally tell my mom that I'm a girl.

I'm in the car, my mom is driving me to school. I tell her that I have something important to say. I say that I've been having ""identity problems"" recently (being vague in case it went badly, which it did). Then, my mom said ""you'll always be my son, my boy"", and ""you'll never find true love if you ***pretend*** to be a girl (her words not mine)"". Because of this response I decided instead to say that I've been experiencing ****sexual**** identity problems (I came out as a gay male earlier this year), which she bought, thank god. 

So, I guess my question Is this; what should I do? I'm sixteen, and my eighteenth birthday is in just under twenty months. Is there anything I can do? Is it a a smart idea to just stay in the closet until I'm eighteen? I'm desperate. Thanks.

Amberhawke6242,asktransgender,Does anyone else here not do Halloween?,"I keep being asked by my friends what I'm going to dress up as this year for Halloween. The thing is that since I started transitioning a year and a half ago I haven't really felt like wearing a costume. I kinda feel like I've worn a costume for most of my life and I'm finally myself. 

I was wondering if anyone else felt that way too?"
Posiblethrowway,asktransgender,No idea what to think. What should I be doing with myself? I fell like I am at a juncture and do not know what to think.,"First things first. My account says throw away but that may change and if it does I will update the post with my non-throwaway username. 

Now let me begin, I am a 25 year old male and identify as bi. Over the past few days I have moved from looking at fetishist trans porn to learning and reading about the stories of transgender people. It has turned into an obsession, notably sparked by the comfort I oddly (for me) felt watching youtube vlogs detailing different peoples transition stories. They spoke to me in a way and have stirred up thoughts I had never truly considered. 

As a child and going through puberty I cant point to me ever feeling envious of women or specifically thinking that I wanted to be a girl/woman. Though my family and friends have always noted my heightened emotional sensitivity. I also never really wanted to be friends with males and truly enjoyed my friendships I established with females. My friendships with them never lasted as long I would have like them to looking back. There was always a fear in the back of my mind that made me ultimately cut off contact or slowly move in another direction. I feared continuing the friendships out of fear that myself not sleeping with the girls would somehow out me (even though I was not and am not gay I am bi) or that my secret love of ""feminine"" past times would be exposed. How would it look to my peers if they suddenly found out how much I loved gossip, hair, painting nails, shopping etc... There was to much risk. I was and am an odd person and have a history of being bullied and the potential to be further isolated was not something that I felt was worth risking. 

Now over the past few days lurking on this thread and reading and watching other peoples stories of transition Im getting goosebumps. Could I be trans? I dont know maybe. Maybe im looking for an excuse. Things in my life have never felt fulfilling everything I have ever done has felt like some lie Im telling to myself. Like Im just going through the motions to go through the motions. 

But each moment I continue to think about this certain things and patterns in my life are sticking out. My abject fear of ever looking or accidentally doing something feminine makes sense in a way. It makes sense because that fear stems from the jarring realization (more me just admitting to myself) that I truly enjoy doing those things. The few times I have ever worn womens clothing have always filled me with joy and admittedly some arousal, though I think that arousal is from my self imposed taboo. Or the fact that I have always been frustrated shopping because really mens clothing just isnt that interesting. 

Another thing that just struck me is that I have been gravitating away from my closest friend who is a woman. The reason being is that she always wants to have wine gossip and movie days with me. Which from time to time I have let my guard down enough to relax and enjoy but more often than not downplay what it really is. Then make excuses to do something else because I have some odd need to not be girly when really all that I want to be is girly. 

Well this is getting long so I will sum this up in as concise of a manner as I can muster. I think there are things in my past and in my current state that are pointing to me possibly being trans. Just writing this is an incredible relief. Like some weight has suddenly been lifted off my chest. Im starting to cry. There are so many things I have to ponder and deal with from here on out. Just the fact that I am on this sub is an indicator to me. Maybe I am caught up maybe I am not. 

Please give me your thoughts? Really anything, I am difficult to offend. 

Also any advise on discrete ways for me to try out wearing some different cloths in the privacy of my own basement. I cant order online because I am living with the parents while I finish up school and I dont want to go shopping for fear of being recognized while I am figuring this out. "
Alice197,asktransgender,How my body will be if i start HRT ?,"Hello

I'm currently 19yo male and will have 20 at the beginning of 2017. People are saying i look 15yo.
My measures : 5,75"", 114lbs, BMI: 18,5 (the limit)
I try to eat a lot but i don't take a lbs. I'm flat and it seem the fat is going to my hips.
My sister have big breasts (same measurements like me), same for my mother that she needed a breasts reduction.

Do you think, with my small BMI, it will be possible to get easily feminine shapes one the HRT started, if I eat a lot ?

I'll get my first rendez-vous with a psychiatrist on first days of november which he's really know in my country.

I really hope to start my HRT on my birthday :)

The majority of it has turned from brown to blond thanks to HRT, so laser isn't a financially viable option; plus the blond hair isn't that noticeable. But HRT has also turned some of it from brown to jet black. It's so dark it shows through my (pale) skin even when I've shaved as close as physically possible.

Vadara,asktransgender,Does this story idea of mine not treat being trans seriously enough?,"I'm a bisexual cis male, and I've been writing a story on and off. It's a Fantasy (sort of--there's magic in the setting and people doing superhuman things, but it's not really classical Fantasy) story that takes place at a boarding high school. It's mostly a comedy about the misadventures of the protagonist and his friends, but I like to have serious moments in it as well, and talk about things like sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. It's got as many serious moments as funny ones.

There are already a bisexual and gay guy who end up as a couple, and I decided I wanted to add a trans character as well. In the hero's sophomore year, a new person transfers to the school. They appear to be male, and can fight like the other characters, but they do not fight as themselves; instead, they transform into a warrior form which is female in both looks and voice. At first, this new character on transforms when necessary (and is nervous about doing it), but later on as they grow more comfortable with the cast they appear in the form more and more, sometimes even going to class in it. Eventually the hero asks them one night why they do it, and the transfer student reveals that they're transgender, and learned how to transform into a swordswoman to deal with their dysphoria. She is very nervous about this, and worries about what the others thing, but the hero hugs her and tells her he's fine with it. Later, she comes out to the rest of the cast, who are all fine with it, and they become a regular cast member getting into the same misadventures and mischief as everyone else. 

The thing I'm worried about is that this downplays the experience of being trans. After all, trans people in real life cannot magically transform into their desired appearance. I thought about making it so she can only transform for a limited time, thus meaning they can only ""pass"" for a while, but *this* feels like I'm implicitly saying ""trans people can never truly become comfortable with their bodies and must always worry about passing, even if they can freakin' *magically* transform"". I dunno what to do. I don't want to appear insensitive. 

Another minor thing is describing them. Do I just use ""he"" until the truth is revealed? Are my characters transphobic for unwittingly using ""he"" before they know to use ""she""?

Finally, I'm unsure on what to do *after* this character arc. Once the character comes out, what else can I really do with them? Their trans nature is not something I want to use for jokes (I have a hard rule to never make racist, sexist, or queerphobic jokes, since they're both lazy/unfunny and insensitive) but it's also something that really wouldn't come up during wacky boarding school adventures. This isn't like the gay/bi couple above, whose queerness is often visible. Once my trans character comes out, their transness will somewhat recede into the background. Is this fine?"
hohahuhi,asktransgender,"About the arousal when imagining about being of the ""opposite"" gender that come up often here. What theories do we have ?","As being very aroused myself at the thought of having a female body to the point that it bothers me (I avoid doing too much girly stuff as a result because it's instant boner guaranteed), I've been trying the theorize why it happens.  
So far I have these theories :  
- A fetish that has gone too far, basically we want so bad to realize our fantasies that we begin developing dysphoria as a result (a bit AGPish so I don't like it).  
- The ""coping"" mechanism. Some of us funnel the desire into sexual arousal to help us cope with our inner ""transness"".  
-The ""reward"" mechanism. I've been reading it from a poster here (sorry can't find the comment). Basically, our brains try to show us that we're thinking about the right gender by rewarding it with a ""boner"". When I wear something feminine if I stop the usual process (jerking, coming and feeling ridiculous and terrible after) and think two seconds to see if it feels right or wrong, it feels completely right, yes. At this kind of moment I'm 100% sure I need to transition, until I come and feel terrible.  


Getting aroused by it is very confusing, which is why I think so much people come here to seek help.  
What do you think ? Any other theories on that question?"

     My older said exactly the same thing. Her husband's comment was. ""Is that all - that's about as significant as being told someone is left handed"". 
     Of course, it is only the first step in fully coming out as the person I am. And I am sure that as the circle of people who know gets bigger I will start to get some unpleasant responses. But my children and their families were the ones who mattered most to me.

        I'm asking this question on behalf of my girlfriend, she is really shy and is a frequent lurker on this thread but not a poster (yet).  Yesterday we had her second appointment through a clinic for starting HRT and frankly the visit left us baffled.  For background, her first visit the doctor explained HRT and ran an initial bloodwork test and everything came back clean so we got our first prescription 2mg estradiol and 50mg spironolactone.  Fast forward three months later to the second visit, second set of bloodwork, but the doctor refused to raise her spiro and would not give a valid reason, and only raised her estradiol to 3mg.  Given what I've seen on here this isn't typical.  When I asked the nurse what the doctor's reason was for not raising the spironolactone, he gave a vague response about not wanting to raise them both at the same time to see how the estrogen levels do for the next three months.  Again, the visit time seems weird to what I've heard for others.  If it matters, my gf is 6 ft and weighs roughly 160, and has a pretty  standard to low blood pressure.   She's the healthiest person I know, and when she got her second test results they even said everything was perfect.  Heck, they commented her testosterone was still too high. So should we take this as normal or get a second opinion?  Any feedback is appreciated, we don't really have anyone else to ask."

Kaetlynn,asktransgender,Any travel tips for Thailand?,"Hello folks,

I'm counting down the days until I get to go (it's still over a month away, so I'll be counting for a while), and the person who is coming with me has questions I can't answer. And I have questions! If you've gone through this already, perhaps you know?

1. Should we bring water purification tablets or filters, etc? Is the water in the hotels drinkable and usable for cooking? (we'll be in Bangkok). Is bottled water available? Is it more cost effective to bring filters/tablets or to buy water? What did you do and would you do it again?

2. Cell phones: did you get a local SIM, or did you have your cell carrier put you on some kind of international roaming plan? (I'm with t-mobile in the USA and I have an iPhone 6, not sure if I can just pop in a Thai SIM that I buy in the airport? Any ideas?).

3. Netflix catalog! I know watching Netflix will be a thing while I'm recovering. Assuming you bring your own tablet to watch on, do you have access to all the same shows you would in your home country without doing any networking tricks to make Netflix think you're still IN your home country? If not, what did you have to do?

That's all for now :) Thanks for any help! And if you have any other tips for things to pack / do / travel hacks / life hacks to make the trip easier or more comfortable, please do share!"
Magenta-Rose,asktransgender,So my brothers are trying to push me to come out to my parents . . .,"I'm currently living away from home for uni, and while I'm still pre everything, I'm living full time now. On the waiting list for HRT.

None of the people I know at home know, except my brothers. I've just told them last week, and they were super supportive and lovely and sweet about it, and have already started referring to me as their sister. (on a weird side note though, my very inappropriate brother told me that a prerequisite for his support is if when I get a vagina, he gets to see what it looks like (this is not unexpected behaviour for him))

I'll have to go home for christmas in guy mode, because no one else knows, but both my brothers are really pushing me to tell my parents when I get home. They've both said they'll be there to help and support me, and that, while it might take a little bit of time, my parents will be supportive. 

My question is, how in all hells do I work up the courage to tell my parents, who at one stage yelled ""No son of mine will ever be wearing women's clothing!"" at me when I was wearing my friend's coat?"

auniqueun,asktransgender,Has anyone else had a suspiciously difficult time filling hormone prescriptions?,"**My Story:**

Over the past several days, I had a request for a transfer mysteriously disappear into the aether, then another request for transfer denied because ""it had no refills remaining"" (when it did), then when I sufficiently proved I still had refills it was scheduled for pickup two days out when I'd mentioned I'd gone without for three days already (!!!), and *then* when I tried to transfer it to another pharmacy they refused to check stock at other pharmacies in their own chain and forced me to do the legwork--and when I found one which had it (they checked the packaging from my previous fill and then showed me an equivalent of another brand they had in stock), it was suddenly, apparently, mysteriously out of stock, literally ten minutes later, when the call for the transfer was made.

And the entire time, not a single pharmacy employee bothered to speak to me about any of this (when I was *personally sitting in the pharmacy lobby at both locations*). Luckily, I had an actually helpful pharmacy assistant check stock in other pharmacies in the chain at the second pharmacy, and *they* found somewhere that then filled my prescription.

In other words, either there was an absurd degree of incompetence and/or laziness and ill fortune taking place at multiple pharmacies, or...

**So, the question:** Anyone else had similarly unusual experiences? And is this, like, a normal pharmacy thing, or...?

Because it *seriously* raised my suspicions. (Especially since several doctors have bluntly and outright refused to see/treat me at all, in times and places with fewer legal protections. Though other doctors have actually personally given their staff a tongue-lashing for not treating me like any other patient, to be fair.)"

So, I'm almost at the 1 year mark with HRT, have started laser, and now that I'm presenting female more and more often, my genital dysphoria is getting worse and worse. My parents (who I'm financially dependant on and using their issuance) are pretty much forcing me to put off any kind of surgery until after college (2 more years) but it's not like I can get it when I graduate because recovering from a major surgery isn't something I can do while looking for/working at my first job. So that puts the wait at something like 3 years, and... I don't think I can do it. I'd love to get it done this coming summer, but my parents pretty much are forcing me to go an internship instead, and have told me I can't use their insurance for surgery, even though it'll cover it.

I want someone to say I'm beautiful and give me attention like they do to the attractive girls. I don't know though. Sometimes I look through websites of women's clothing and wish that I could wear it and be attractive, but I know it wouldn't fit my body properly and I'd probably feel disgusted with myself if I wore it.

The thing is, this last month I feel like my body has started to change on its own:
 
- My hair has grown much faster than the rest of the year (like more than 1 inch in a month vs 5 or so in the previous 9 months).

- Beard seems to grow real slow (a shave every 3 or 4 days vs everyday before, but I started laser and this could be related (but I started 2 months ago and the first month didn't notice slowing, just less density, as expected))

- I think my figure looks all around more feminine, I kinda get glimpses of femme even when not wearing makeup or anything (don't pass at all though, I wish xD)

- My skin looks definitely smoother. I didn't start using any product, but a couple people told me that my skin looked better.


Sooooo, I don't know. My experience before this (since January when I came out of the closet to myself) has been a very low self esteem, and suddenly it seems like I can only see myself improving, even without hormones yet. Am I going crazy? Is it possible for the body to ""sense"" what is coming and start working towards that? Am I just very lucky?

Now that I think of it: could it be related to the season? I didn't care for my looks before, so maybe this normal for winter?

I would post pictures, but I have few, and the only ones I have are with different combos of clothes / makeup experiments."

So, when I was about 11-12 I actually started realizing my sexuality. Back then, I had no idea trans people existed or there was a term for anything like that. I had some behavior that pointed to being trans and stuff, but back then I honestly had no idea.

The thing is though, even though I didn't know I was a man back then I still felt like it was ""wrong"" for me to like men. I identified bi back then and I had no problem with liking women, but for a long time I really felt like I had to hide my attraction to men, long before I found out about trans people and about my own gender identity. It was like there was some part of me that kinda felt it went against the norms, which back then was really confusing because well, back then I thought I had to be a woman by default and therefore it would be straight and ""normal."" 
To add to this, I was somewhat homophobic back then, which still doesn't explain why I didn't then apply it to myself liking women.

Did anyone else have feelings like this? It's taken me a long while to come to terms with liking men even after years of knowing I'm a man, and I'm honestly still working on it. "

Also sent this through my phone so I'm sorry for the spellng errers!

So I know this question has been thrown around a lot on here, so I apologize for being redundant! But essentially this subreddit is the only place I feel I can discuss this matter. It's nerve-wracking even doing this for me as I've never told anyone about this.


It started when I was in middle school, i know its weird but I saw a mountain dew commercial where a guy turned into a woman (it's totally on YouTube btw!), during a football game. Immediately, a million thoughts ran through my mind and it felt like something had hit me. I remember it clearly, it's actually so vivid in my mind to this day. I remember drawing that back to the dreams I had a little younger, one being where I turned into Oprah �� and another where I was just a girl. It wasn't until I saw that commercial that it had almost clicked.

Fast forward a few years, my almost fascination of becoming a girl was growing. I'd always look up tg transformation on YouTube, but never trans videos, always transformation ones. I guess it was out of envy of being a real woman at the snap of a finger. And if I'm being honest I hated myself for it. It felt wrong at face value. My Christian values/upbringing and conservative have almost created a fear of even thinking about exploring the idea. I hoped it'd go away with time.

I'm 24 now, and the feelings clearly didn't stop. Almost the opposite, actually. Up until this point, I was always fascinated with the 'transformation' side of things (fake obviously, like that commercial) but it's now dawning on me that maybe it was just a cover to how I truly felt. I looked into it a lot and i never knew about HRT or SRS. I guess i hid from even looking because i was scared of what my family/friends would think. 

Now, im just at a confusion point. I was a frat kid. I've dated a lot of women. Never had depression about the issue til recently. There is a quiz on here that is like ""what do you consider your genitals?"" And honestly I can say I have a penis. I don't feel like I have a vagina, cuz i dont have one. But do I wish I could have a vagina? Yes. Do I feel as if I should've been born a woman? Probably about 60% of the time, but I don't know if it's genuine if that makes any sense at all. Like is it just a weird fascination/envy, or are my feelings to be a woman real?

A few key points that might mean nothing (WARNING: humble brag below) but according to most people I am a very attractive person. I've had girls throw themselves at me pretty regularly, and ill admit i like the attention. But in a way, i feel almost envious of women, as they always seem to get attention. Ill be honest (swear my douchebaggerry will stop soon) i work out almost every day, and i got jealous of women. It got to the point where i was crankin out squats regularly and now my butt is absolutely huge. I have a narrow waist, and since I've been doing squats (if you want a butt, this is and will always be the way to do it!) its become the proudest part of my body. Its voluptuous/woman-like, and if I'm being honest, is the main reason I'm even proud of it. I put panties on for the first time, and it felt amazing. Like I had a brief moment of bliss just wearing them ya know?

So clearly I suck at writing and should probably just stop given I didn't take my a.d.d medicine today and I know that was a cluster fuck of a story. However, I would love to hear some feedback from you all, and wanted to thank you for what you do here. Whether I transition or not, you all really do a spectacular job around here, and I love hearing about your progress and triumphs :)"
heythisisathrowawayf,asktransgender,"[Long Rant] I'm Living with a Monster, Advice?","So, I have one of those... ""supportive"" mothers, that I don't think is really supportive. I even hesitate to call her mother because I hate her so fiercely, but sometimes I'm counteracted with pity for what a pathetic and worthless creature she is. I guess it's like someone feeling sympathy for an ugly dumb animal. Anyway, this is a rant about the stress she gives me and how I'm about to fucking lose my cool. 

We had another fight recently, in fact, it was a series of mini fights that blew up into one big fight about 10 minutes ago. All day today, I've been getting screamed at. Why? Because apparently the fan in my laptop is too loud. :| Yes, you heard that right, the fan in my laptop, that can't even be heard from the next room, caused her to throw temper tantrums all day. Now, my fan is on by default if my computer's getting too hot, and I've been working on stuff for several hours today, so naturally it's been a little warm and required the primary fan to spin a bit. The secondary fan has seldom been on, and the two in synergy are not very loud. But hey, logic? Let's throw it out the goddamn window. Apparently it gives her migraines and drives her insane to the point that she can't concentrate to look at shit on Craigslist. Mind you, I've had this same computer for months and months, and only now is this being brought up. 

I got so sick of the yelling that I ended up opening the freezer and setting the base in there for maybe 30 seconds with the door open, to cool things down. It lowered the core temp maybe 2 degrees, woo. So, eventually she shuts the fuck up and leaves me alone. Now, when she gets mad over small shit like this, she'll use my deadname, but not by accident. She'll say ""FUCKING TURN IT OFF I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT... deadname."" There's a pause to add emphasis. My response is, ""Go fuck yourself and leave me alone."" And she'll say, ""Oh, sorry."" real sarcastic like. 

So it's the AM, and you know what? I'm sitting in my bed, minding my own business, and I hear a fucking crash. I had my headphones on at the time with some music going, so hearing the crash tells me it was pretty loud. It was her pounding on an open door/wall. Immediately I jump slightly, and say ""What the...?"" And she says, ""YOU NEED TO TURN THAT GODDAMN SHIT OFF NOW SO I CAN SLEEP."" I'm like, ""The fan's hardly even spinning, I can barely hear it, there's no possible way it can be heard in another room."" This is true, I couldn't hear it at the other end of my room. So she reaches to yank the cord out between my knees. I move her hand away, several times, and she starts getting a little violent and says, ""You fucking touch me and I'll have you put behind bars."" Mind you, this is the same woman that threatened me when I was 13 and under that she'd hit herself and call the police saying I did it if I didn't do exactly what I wanted. 

After I tell her I don't care, she yanks it out of the wall and goes in her room, screaming the entire way. ""You mother fucker, you're violent and I'm recording your voice."" My response to her droning on and on was, ""Leave me alone."" Unless she told me to shut the fuck up, in which case I said the exact same thing back. So she says, ""This doctor that prescribed you these hormones, he needs to know, he needs to know you're fucked up. You shouldn't be on this shit, you shouldn't be on these hormones, they're making you violent and crazy."" Mind you, throughout all of this, I didn't get up once except to plug the charger back in. But apparently I'm violent and abusive for standing up for myself and throwing the same words she's using against me at her. But eventually, you have to realize, it's pointless replying to her, because she'll just yell, ""LALALALALA YOU'RE X BECAUSE I SAY SO."" She literally yells ""LALALALLALALA"" just to get her voice over mine. Also, it doesn't matter if I'm trying to sleep or anything, but if she is, it's the end of the world. I get told to shut the fuck up either way.

So anyway, she kept going on and on, ""I'm going to call this doctor tomorrow and tell him if he doesn't take you off these hormones I'll sue the fucking shit out of him. Ever since you've been on these hormones, you've been violent and dangerous. You're so dangerous, if I were to call the police right now, and show them these drugs you're on, they would be like 'holy shit, yeah you need to come with us'."" She made sure to say she'd inform them they're recreational drugs I don't need, because ""I shouldn't be on them."" I told her to try it and watch what happens, because I know if she did, they'd see the difference in temperaments and understand what a psychotic raging lunatic she is. I recall when I was 15, when she got arrested for obstructing a call I made to 911 and 4th degree assault on me. Her pleads to the police were, ""I'm a good church woman, I go to church all the time."" They didn't care, and they could see what a liar she was, so I'm not worried about that at all.

Back to tonight, she also said, ""You're not acting like a girl, girls don't act like you do."" Like, excuse me? So I asked what I was acting like then, and she said, ""A fucking retard."" She should go look in the mirror if she wants to see an idiot, because this is someone that struggles with basic math and English. There's little to no self-awareness, just constant laziness to the point that she refuses to do any research on something she needs to do, because it's either ""too hard"" or ""I don't know how and don't want to learn."" I'm talking basic things to, like using Google Maps or finding alternatives to Zillow. Even understanding the basics of a bank statement is too difficult for her, ""What does pending mean?"" Not like I explain it every other day or anything, maybe that's why I ignore her pleas for help so often now.

But man, the supportive thing gets me. She looooves to tell people she's supportive... unless they're her church friends, then she says I'm not even trans, because she deadnames me to them and never mentioned my transition. Like I wouldn't care, but I hear her on the phone saying, ""Yes X is doing fine, he's doing X."" And she'll say it out loud too and doesn't care if I hear. Her excuse? ""I'd go to jail for killing them over the things they would say if I told them."" What a load of bullshit. Another time, I tried to explain how crippling my dysphoria is, and she told me, ""It's all in your head, you look feminine, you just have some dysmorphia or something going on because you don't look masculine."" At first glance that appears a supportive gesture, but it isn't. I clearly have problem areas that cause me distress and can and have (pre-hrt) gotten me clocked. According to her, it's normal for [cis] girls to have broad shoulders and narrow hips, because anyone with a defined waist is somehow a Kardashian and I want to be one, despite the fact she's the one that watches all that trash reality TV and I can't stand them. It's basically a subtle way of trying to tell me what to do with my body and implying I'm nuts for wanting to change anything. 

It gets worse though. I'll flat out tell her she's not supportive, so she should stop bragging that she is. She'll say, ""I use your new name and gender most of the time. I slip up I need time."" No, she doesn't. It's been over a year. My response is something like, ""Supportive people don't say the things you say to me."" So she says, ""Well those hormones make you crazy, you shouldn't be anywhere near them. You weren't meant to have boobs, sorry but that's the way it is. You act the way you do because your body is rejecting them."" If I tell her there's no body of evidence to support her claim, her reply is, ""You just think you know everything, never met someone that always has to be right."" She actually says that to everyone she gets into a fight with and denies she says it multiple times, just like she denies ever abusing me as a kid and I made it all up. So I say, ""I've done my research, I'm standing up to how you treat me."" She'll condescendingly laugh and say, ""No you haven't, and I do everything for you. Look, I even let you stay rent free in my house and on occasion pay for things."" First off, it's not her house, she's a fucking bum that's never had a legal job in all the time I've known her. She mooches off my dad that hates her, and the two fight everyday and can't stand each other. I'm here back in this house because I was begged to help take care of her because she had surgery last year. I took it as an opportunity to transition, and believe me, once I get my vagina, I'm fucking out like nobody's business. Does she pay for things sometimes? Yeah, with constant complaints along the way... with my dad's money, who doesn't give a shit what it's spent on. Thing is, you can't buy me to make up for abuse, so using that as an excuse to treat me like shit really pisses me off. I recall Dr. Phil saying, ""I don't care if that child is riding home in a Ferrari, abuse is abuse.

Another time, I was in the car, and she had this church CD. She told me she wanted me to listen to it, because it was a guest speaker pastor at her church and he was going on about how if he had trans grandkids he'd beat the shit out of them. I'm like, ""Why would you want me to listen to your typical bigoted small town Christian pastor?"" Her response? ""Christians don't hate trans people."" I'm just like, ""That's not even what I said, and you're missing the point, why would you want me to listen to hate speech?"" She says, ""Because if it's bad I want to send it to the transgender community."" I'm beside myself at this point. ""Why? What community would be surprised by some religious nutcase saying we're freaks that need to be physically harmed? They're a dime a dozen."" Not long after, she receives a phone call from a friend, who refers to me as her son, to which I say, ""I'm no one's son."" and she shushes me and waves her hand at me, like it's such a terrible thing I bothered to correct her similar aged drug addict friend. It reminds me of when she said military culture is different and that's why they ""hate transgenders"" or when she assumed some guy was trans because he was nice, dirty and poor.

There was one time she did something right, emphasizing another trans woman's pronouns with some jackass prejudice gay guy misgendering them on purpose, but there isn't much beyond that. I genuinely think she's a bad person. She's been banned from many places in town for making scenes and complaining about arbitrary shit. When that shooting in Washington happened, she said, ""Well that's fucking Macy's for you, always pissing people off."" All because she hates the staff at our local Macy's. I said, ""Are you seriously justifying a spree killing?"" She said, ""No I would never, just that people at Macy's are assholes."" 

Speaking of arbitrary shit. The fan isn't the first thing that's set her off. She'll come in my room and say it's filthy and needs to be cleaned. I'm pretty fucking clean mind you, I clean everyday on my own volition. I'll usually ask what she's talking about, and she'll have to look around and make something up or come up with something simple... or something vague I don't understand. ""There's an odor in here, it smells, I'm hyperventilating and need this cleaned or I'll have to go to the doctor because you're killing me with this."" And that's not a hyperbole either, she's dead serious and thinks some imaginary smell is literally killing her. Sometimes she'll even think the house is on fire in the walls because she can smell it with ""her superior sense of smell"", much like her ""superior sense of hearing"". If it's not that, it's another thing, like the towel isn't straight enough in the bathroom, or there's crumbs in the kitchen... that she left because she's a fucking pig or I've been laying down too long. It's just her way of trying to control me; she's a control freak. If I need her to do me a favor, she'll make up arbitrary restrictions like, ""If I do that, you need to go to sleep by X."" Never do I agree to her terms, ever, because I'm an adult and won't be treated like a child. 

That's really the crux of it. I won't let her treat me like a slave and I'll stand up for myself when I'm being talked down to. Whenever I'm happy, she'll say shit like, ""Why are you all broken out?"" I'm like, ""Stress?"" And she'll say, ""You have nothing to be stressed about, you have no bills."" For one, I have some lofty credit card bills I pay every month. For two, the dysphoria can give me a bit of depression, but hey, according to her it's imaginary. Fact is, she stresses me out nearly every single day. I could ask her something simple, like, ""What are you doing today?"" and she'll say, ""I don't know shut the fuck up I'm busy."" But that's all made up if she buys me something for $30, even though she owes me $700 from the $1000 she practically bullied and coerced out of me several months ago for a vacation/trip. Ah yes, such threats as, ""I'll drop you off at the police station you piece of shit, I'll show them what a fucking monster you are if you don't give me the money for the trip."" It's not just me she's an asshole to, in the car, and let me tell you she's one of the worst drivers I've ever seen, she constantly screams at other drivers for nothing. They can't even hear her, only I can, it drives me insane. Then there's this time I was in the grocery store with her. She kept telling me to go get cereal for myself. I told her I didn't want any, so she started saying, ""Go get some fucking cereal."" rather loudly, around children no less. I don't like cereal so I didn't want any. It's the same thing with many meats. If I say I don't like pork, like I do every week, I'm making it up and it's completely new. God, one time I was in the car, sick as a dog, about ready to throw up everywhere, and she was screaming and threatening me because apparently I was lying about the directions off Google Maps to a building we had to go to. In fact, I recall her saying, ""I don't give a fuck how you're feeling."" But hey, she's soooo supportive because she calls me by my name and genders me correctly 75% of the time.  

If I see progress with my boobs, or something, and I'm happy about it, I get shot down with something like, ""Why would breasts hurt unless there's something wrong with you? Why are you destroying your body? You don't need boobs to look like a woman."" Which is similar to her, ""If you wanna be a woman act like one."" Which reminds me of her, ""A woman should never be president because we need a first lady."" beliefs, and to her lesbians are disgusting and sinful, but she also supports them because it's ""God's way."" Something about loving the sinner, I don't know. Speaking of which, to her, I'm not a real lesbian and if I use dildos I'm a gay man, because only gay men enjoy anal sex to her. I still get asked questions like, ""How do you even know what anal / oral sex is?"" I'm like... ""Are you fucking serious? I'm in my 20s and I've lived abroad for awhile, never mind the fact I knew all about sex and whatnot at a very very very early age."" But hey, to her I'm just an ignorant, naive confused idiot that doesn't know anything about anything. Even though she'll ask me about being trans because ""it's so new"" and then shoot down half what I say.

Also, apparently I shouldn't have my SRS in Thailand because all the Thais are dog eating rapists that would harvest my organs, and any reviews for Chett and alike are lies spread by human traffickers, and that I don't know shit, despite her not having done any research on this. But hey, according to her, every vagina looks the same and the USA is the best there possibly is for it.

There's no support when I mention my transition goals, just that I shouldn't change anything, because I'm fine as is, and there's nothing to feminize, like I said earlier, because I'd look like a freak with bigger hips (I'm skinny as fuck) or bigger boobs. I know this is a long rant, and I really hope some of you read through all of it, it's just, I'm so stressed out and tired, so very tired of everything. I needed a place to vent, to just maybe hear I'm not losing my mind. I really want to get out of here, but I don't want to dip into my surgery money because of how crippling my genital dysphoria is. I'm sure the ""I'll find a way to have you arrested and out of my house"" shit will go away by the time I wake up, only to spring up in another three or four days. What I find most ironic is, she desperately doesn't want me to find a job and tries to get me to stop applying, because moving out of state is more important than me working, or transitioning. 

So I guess I need a question. How would you deal with living with one of the dumbest, psychotic, passive aggressive, angry, bitchy, at times belligerent, holier than thou, smarter than thou 60 year old mothers you'll ever see? One thing she admits, because she hates her mother is, ""No wonder I'm fucked up because of that bitch and those cunts."" but mind you, none of them are admittance to maybe having bi-polar, OCD, ADD or something. Probably because she lies to people in public to make herself appear different, and when a doctor catches on, she threatens legal action. Sigh.

Edit: If I posted this several years ago, like I have... with similar confrontations over other things, on other subs (circa 4-5 years ago), I'd feel this overwhelming sense of guilt, like I shouldn't be saying these things, I'm wrong and I'm at fault, I'm biased and not seeing the whole picture. But today? Now? I don't care, I don't feel that way. I'm so envious of normal families. "
[deleted],asktransgender,starting is the hardest part?,"the possibility of starting HRT is on the horizon, right now the scariest thing for me is the thought of what comes next: more coming out, changing name and pronouns, etc. I keep changing my mind about different things and I have very severe anxiety that manifests itself as an intense form of self-doubt. I had to leave University because I thought I was going to have another major depressive episode and I'm just really shaky and struggling right now.

I'm just so scared for when I fully come out and no longer go by the old name anymore, so scared I can't sleep and feel physically ill :( this extreme anxiety is what's making me doubt myself so much."
SierraDestruction,asktransgender,Is dysphoria a necessity for being trans?,"Hi, new FtM here, and theres something thats bothering me but also confusing me. I've had dysphoria pretty much all my life, and just recently I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a boy (cue confetti). I was on Tumblr last night and saw a post about a boy who was in therapy and had just came out as transgender. He said that the therapist was surprised that he was actually trans because of a lot of people say they are but actually aren't. This is actually a fear of mine, having my true identity rejected because of how other people treat the idea of being trans. This led to a argument over what makes a trans person trans, so I decided to throw my two cents in because I am an adamant believer that if you do not suffer from dysphoria than you are not trans. The person that I was popping it off with said that being trans was like being otherkin, that its more of a spiritual thing, and that people who say that transgender people suffer from dysphoria support the sterotype that all trans hate themselves. I'm pretty confused, so I was wondering is having dysphoria a necessity for being trans, or can it be something like a spiritual thing? Thank you for reading! &lt;3"

RockerBoyGirl,asktransgender,Can gender dysphoria just disappear?,"

At age 14-15, I would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, was curious about reincarnation. At the time I had no idea this could mean I was trans. Only recently (age 20) have I thought back and questioned this. This seemed to be strong textbook gender dysphoria. What's odd however is, whether I suppressed them or not, they just faded away after I realized what I was doing wouldn't work. As a result I'm worried it'll come back so I'm trying to be as proactive as possible.

Is it possible for it to just disappear?

USS-Enterprise,asktransgender,Toxic Femininity [rant],"Disclaimer, these are simply my incoherent thoughts on some things I've seen in the past week or so and I don't claim that it makes sense or is at all correct.

For some reason comments on toxic masculinity have found me recently, and I've seen thoughts in response to those thoughts about toxic feminity not being real, etc. 

First of all everyone who really thinks that can GO FUCK THEMSELVES. Maybe 'toxic feminity' isn't a phrase the way that 'toxic masculinity' is but anyone who thinks there's nothing bad about feminity is a fucking idiot.

There are so many pressures on women to be a certain way and when they don't meet these standards, society backlashes. That sounds pretty toxic to me.

Beauty standards, for example. The idea that women owe men sex. There are definitely shitty ideas involves with feminity. 

But besides that? The idea that feminity can't hurt anyone. It's hurt me, though. So fucking much. It's suffocating and I honestly feel wrong for existing, as a transboy. I read something someone said last week, I don't remember exactly, but it was an older woman encouraging a young trans girl who was early in discovering her identity. It was really awesome and they were talking about how there was so much strength in feminity.

I reacted, though, with jealousy. Why? No one's ever going to tell me that, ha. Nope. Masculinity is this shitty thing that ruins people while feminine people are perfect angels.

That's not true though! They're both ideas that aren't completely good or bad. 

And it *hurts*. It feels like I'm being told that I'm turning my back on this wonderful things only to join the dark side full of rapists. And I feel like shit about it and I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to exist.

It's not just society telling me that I should live up to certain standards because that's how society likes it. It's society telling me that all the good people choose these feminine standards and the bad people choose the other masculine ones.

But feminity is imperfect too and why does everyone think it's not. :("

IntoTheDarkDescent,asktransgender,Is it weird that I don't want to transition?,"I'm an FtM transgender and I don't want to do HRT, is too expensive, and Greece isn't doing well and I don't have a job, and I probably won't get a job anytime soon because our unemployment is above 60% (though the media will say otherwise, because it makes the government look good) and getting a job as a student is almost impossible, so I'm living on nothing for a while except what friends and family can help provide, I live in Nafplio which is no big city like Athens, we don't have much for jobs here, and what we do have is mostly very low pay. Even our doctors here aren't paid well for economic reasons. But the government still charges us a lot of taxes so that they can ""fix"" things. I can barely make enough to live on now and when get job I will only barely make enough to go out with friends and live, I can't afford transition for years ahead. So I don't see the point in doing so at all, I should focus more on being happy as I am. (I know not all of Greece is poor, but is a small city, and we don't have many new jobs being made, I'm poor, not all of Greece is {because people always get mad when I complain about how bad our economy is})"
zxcv_throwaway,asktransgender,I want a woman's body but I like my male one too and I don't act like a woman,"I've been on here a few times as I try to figure all this stuff out. The more I think about things, the more confusing it all gets. 

Some background...I'm a 21 y/o guy and I've been dealing with rough depression for quite a few years. I have always had this jealousy of girls because of how they are treated by guys in a relationship romantically and sexually. It also makes the guy seem really cute to be the ""man"" for his girl and I want that. Right now I identify as a gay man and it's fun to be the ""woman"" and I see the relationship and I feel things from what I think is a woman's perspective. With some guys though (mostly based on physical features instead of personality) I feel intensely manly and only want to top, protect them, care for them, etc...Bottoming and topping in those cases respectively is very fun. 

However for the ones where I'm the woman, I very much want boobs and a vagina. Many times I even feel like boobs should be there on my chest. If I'm walking around and I have my chest out and shoulders back (good posture stuff) then it almost makes me sad that my nipple areas aren't sticking out more. The vagina part is less of a worry because it's more sexual for me. For both of these parts, I really, really want them for sex. I don't think I can properly feel like the woman in the relationship without them, so if I'm in a male body in that situation then it feels like something's missing. It makes me very depressed to think of a cute guy because I can't be his girl. It actually hurts sometimes when I see guys or think of really cute ones that I know. Something about them and a girl makes them so adorably manly (like a boy into a man kind of thing) and I want to be the girl that they're with. Even if that guy was gay, it wouldn't feel the same. I think about this a lot and it might be a large contributor to my depression.

At the same time I like my penis for when I'm the man in the relationship. This is for a more limited range of guys, but when I become emotionally manly and see things from the perspective of a man, I don't mind my penis at all. 

In general I don't act like a woman - although I tend to be more emotional and less rough and rowdy than guys - I've always been fine with guy friends, I've never cared about makeup or cross dressing or wearing a purse or doing ""girly"" things...

I feel like I'd love to have boobs and a vagina because this is what I'd see myself enjoying the most, even if the vast majority of my identity, outside of a romantic and sexual context, is that of a man. However I'd be really sad to lose my penis and ability to top and be the ""man"" to other guys. 

Obviously this is something I have to learn for myself. My therapist isn't very insightful unfortunately and I'm not making any progress with him. I'm just wondering what you folks think and if you have any thoughts on this. It's all very confusing and stressful because if I have dysphoria for both genders and sexes then that would really suck.

f30bim,asktransgender,Barely any mood swings on injectables? Is this normal?,"Hey guys,
I do IM injections once a week after being on pills for 8 months. 0.5 mL of 40mg/ml strength. The first week I got injections, I had terrible mood swings and an increased sex drive. I'm on my third week now and I haven't had any severe mood swings for the past two weeks and my sex drive is lower. 
I am seeing feminizing results though like increased breast size and less body hair. 

Is this normal? I thought injections were supposed to give mood swings. "
DiscoBombing,asktransgender,Official mental evaluation just left me more confused than ever?,"I discovered I was trans around the tail end of 2014 and have been struggling with it ever since, but only managed to start seeing a therapist about it earlier this year.

For the past few months, these spells of doubt have been less frequent than usual, so I was sure that by the time we did the official evaluation (to get on E and the like), I'd be 100% this is the route to go.

But now that I have the go-ahead from my therapist, doubts have been cropping up.

During our last session, she dropped a ton of info about the realities of transition I hadn't thought about (more intense moods, possible pain due to atrophy, high potassium levels causing heart problems which really sucks cause I love spinach, the fact that chest growth happens a lot faster than hip growth, etc)

I have yet to do any hair removal or vocal training or anything regarding makeup and when it comes right down to it; now that I'm able to make the choice, I'm conflicted on what I should do.

Because the more I think about it, the more I'm beginning to wonder how many of my issues actually come from being transgender. She also said that I showed a lot of signs of OCD and OCD-related anxiety.

And several of my body issues could be tied to weight as well (been severely obese all my life until I started losing around April of last year. Currently down to 189! But weirdly, the more I see of my actual body, the more I'm kind of okay with it?).

I guess basically the question is; am I really trans or am I just so desperate to be someone else that I felt it was the only way out?"

missamelie15,asktransgender,injection site in SO much pain....,"I just took my E shot last night (alternating leg each week) into the upper-outer thigh.. maybe only slightly more discomfort than usual during the injection (nothing alarming) [I did catch a cold on monday and been fighting it since.. only taking OTC meds for it...]

today, woke up and feeling fine (except for the tail end of my cold) but throughout the day, it slowly got more and more painful to walk on my left leg (where the injection was)

It's gotten almost unbearable.. my coworker gave me some ibuprofen (took 2 pills x 400mg ea) about 10 min ago and called my endo. The nurse said what I expected.. take ibuprofen and call back in the morning if the pain hasn't subsided.

There's no significant redness or swelling or bruising... (in fact I once in a while get a purple bruise the size of a quarter... but it hasn't formed here yet...)

I haven't come to terms with it though: I understand that I *am* trans, but the thought that one day I will wake up in a body that I am comfortable with, a body that matches how I feel inside, is sooo surreal. 

The problem is, I don't know how I am going to get to that point. There is no real guide or manual for being trans, and that scares me. In less than a year I am going off to college, and I don't know how, between now and then, I am going to mentally and financially prepare myself for everything that is going to come. I want to tell all of the colleges I apply for that I am transgender, and that I want to get a move on with my transition ASAP, but this is also not something I am ready for my family know. 

I will be an adult soon, but I don't know how I am going to figure this all out on my own.

cbane1991,asktransgender,Is my daughter being pressured?,"I'm sorry for ""the book"" but I really need some help. I need to know how to help my daughter! We have always been so close and I love the REAL her with all my heart - nothing could possibly change that! 

About 6 months ago, my 12-year old daughter confided in me that she has ""dated"" both a boy and a girl (""dating"" means FaceTime, going to movies along with a group of friends and talking at school). She said that she was pansexual and was emotionally attracted to the person, regardless of gender. All I want is her happiness, so I have absolutely no worries or problems with it. She is who she is! I read about pansexuality and did my best to create a safe environment for her to continue talking to me and she has...so I thought. Per her wishes I didn't tell ANYONE, not even her mother/my wife, until she was ready.

My parents raised my sister and me to love and respect ALL people for who they really are - not for race, religion or who others think they should be, so I raised my daughter the same way! I really thought she was happy and finally ""felt free to be who she really is"". The surprise came 2 weeks ago, with no warning!
***  **I mean no offense to anyone** - I am new to this and just need help with how to communicate. If anything I write is offensive, PLEASE accept my apologies and post a reply so I can alter my communication and verbiage. *** 

2 weeks ago, out of nowhere, she looks at my wife and says, ""I'm really a boy and I'd like to talk to a doctor about transitioning. I realized sitting in my room and was like, 'I'm a boy...I'm a boy..."". She mentioned binding her breasts. Her entire life, her dress, her behavior, her mannerisms, her interests have been feminine. I grew up with gay, lesbian and bisexual people - friends and family. In every case, there were very obvious signs. I do not know any transgender people so, I don't know if the signs would be there...I just assume there would be - if not shown to us, then to her friends, but they were all shocked too!

This year, she is at a different school and has different friends. The school is smaller, so she has fewer 'cliques' in which to call her own. In her group of 12 friends, 2 consider themselves ""straight"", 2 are transitioning MTF and FTM and 8 of them have identified as pansexual, bisexual, a-romantic or gay. Her best friend from her old school has spent some time with her with the new friends and thinks they are ""aggressive"" and ""pushy"". She worries that my daughter may feel pressured to fit in. The other friends from the old school that she told don't believe her. I don't want to disbelieve her - I'm ashamed that I AM having such a tough time accepting this...but I just can't help but think that this group plays a part in this!

My daughter has always been VERY much like me...she has always hung out with an ""alternative crowd"", she's artistic, she has a ""warped"" sense of humor, she LOVES great music without regard for genre and she likes what she likes and doesn't care what's popular...its scary how much like me she is! We finish each other's sentences and laugh at the same strange stuff that other people don't immediately see humor in...The downside to this is that she is also JUST LIKE ME at that age...impressionable, low confidence and a bit of a follower when she finds an interest in someone.

My wife, her best friend and I are all worried because this has all come out of left field! In my world, I think of her as ""super girly"". For example, this Halloween, she doesn't have to hide anything (if she ever had to to begin with)! We gave her the option to be ANYTHING she wanted to be - ANYTHING! She didn't choose some androgynous character or someone from Rocky Horror or a boy character...instead, she chose the most ""girly"" costume imaginable! It's a beautiful Renasaunce-style ball gown, an old fashioned masquerade mask, heels, frilly accessories...etc. I don't want to hurt her, but I want to ask, ""why not a boy themed costume?""

I just don't know how to communicate without making it uncomfortable, or worse, making her feel like I don't accept her! I want to dig deeper to find out if this is real or is she being pressured consciously or subconsciously? Or could it be something awful, like is she being bullied or abused and trying to get our attention?

She is THE MOST IMPORTANT person in the world to me! I love her and support her no matter what! I couldn't live with myself if I hurt her or made her feel uncomfortable with who she is!"
BrightEyes04,asktransgender,Being transgender + degenerative disease + depression.,"I know there are hundreds of posts like this one but I guess this one might be a bit different.
I feel like I have to mention this first, i have Ehler-Danlos syndrome. I suffer from chronic pain on my joints, chronic fatigue and depression (which i been suffering since started my puberty) among a lot of other shitty stuff. I mention this because is a big deal on how affects my every day life.
I am 27 now, started hrt like 10 months ago, the doctor kept me with a very very low dose of estradiol and high on cypro for like 7 months and then changed to another doctor who prescribed me injections with the same cypro schedule. My estradiol levels where to low, they are still kinda are but they are getting better.
The thing is that I am not really sure about living as a woman, I don't dress, I don't use make-up just nail polish, I don't act or have the mannerism of a woman and most important of all is that I don't usually see myself as a woman. I know i am not a man and I know I am transgender but I think my time for living as a woman already passed. And it is fucked up because I think I would have been happier if I lived that way but now its too late and I am so tired of everything and I can't figure out if its because of my fatigue and I should keep ongoing anyways or if its just that I can't live as a woman, I don't have the energy for everything that it implies.
I am doing therapy with a psychology who works mainly with transgender people but I feel like it is more a companion on all this shit that I am going trough by helping me to keep up but I don't think that is helping me with an analysis of what I am feeling.
I am not sure what is the finality of this post really. I am just tired of everything and sometimes I think that i just might be looking for happiness in the wrong place with all this treatment even though I explored every other option available."

I'm also scared that if I don't self harm or do something I'll start being suicidal again (as what happened for a while after I stopped hurting myself, I guess I didn't have an outlet so I lost my will to live back then) 
I'm only 16 and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I had a very tough time from when I was 11-14 and everything was very dark and I'm really scared of ever going back to that. 

Even before then I grew up very fast as a child. My dad is an alcoholic drug addict who is also psychotic and mentally ill and he's emotionally destroyed me and my mother but we can't leave because my mom barely makes enough money that would even sustain herself.

I even go to a Catholic all boys school and I'm neither catholic nor a boy &gt;.&lt; All my 'friends' are fake and know me for someone I'm not. And even then, I never hang out with them. Besides running track and cross country, I sit in my room all day and either play video games, my guitar, eat, sleep, or cry. But I like it that way. No one to get in conflict with (besides all the shit kids on video games who suck ass and never should've got csgo let alone esea) peace and quiet, etc.

Anyway, I don't know what to do with my life"
Katie_Deely,asktransgender,How damaging is HRT/SRS to my body?,"Hi there

I'll leave the details out, because it'd be too sad for me to handle it right now.

There's a high chance that I get cancer before my 40^th birthday, and I want to make sure I stay as healthy as possible so that I can lower the chances.

However, I'm very concerned that HRT and SRS will rather contribute to destroying my body.

Hence my question...  How damaging is HRT and SRS to me?

Procrastinationed,asktransgender,"I might be trans, where can I go for advice? (UK)","So I am lost.

I think I'm transgender. I'm terrified, I can't talk to anybody close in real life about this, and I'm shooting for University sometime August next year (to add some weight to my situation). 

The main reason I’m scared is because the question literally isn’t leaving my mind. I can’t go a day without thinking about whether I’m actually trans and it’s gotten to the point where it’s putting a mental strain on my life. When I ask the question ‘do I want to be a woman?’ (I’ve seen in on here before) the answer is always yes, but I don’t know if that’s what I’ve convinced myself because I’ve thought about it for 2 years now or if that’s the genuine truth.

As an 18 year old male, are there any places I can visit to seek help? I’m really bad with confrontation so group talks really aren’t the best choice, but I’m willing to give it a go if it means figuring this out. It’s crushing me inside that I haven’t/can’t talk to anybody close about it (I struggle to make friends and I’m scared of losing the ones I have, and I’m not sure how my parents will react.)

hideway,asktransgender,Am I non-binary or something else?,"I've spent my whole life thinking I'm MTF.  But as I am about to start hormones, I'm starting to wonder if I really am MTF.

I mean, I still have body dysphoria and some social dysphoria. I know I want to do HRT. It's just I don't really care for getting breasts or getting SRS though. I think I just want to be a slightly femme, androgynous person.

But at the same time, I'm not sure what this would mean for my social transition. Do I just not socially transition and just be a queer, androgynous person and don't explain it to anyone? Do I socially transition and tell people I'm a trans woman to help keep things simple for them?

While in semi-denial throughout my life, I've sometimes had thoughts that I'm not really either male or female. I never fully viewed myself as a man or a woman. Both physically (sure, I have a penis, but I never found my body to be ""manly"" or whatever) and mentally. And I'm not sure if this is just who I am or if it's some disguised self-hate in my brain of me trying to deny myself of being able to be either gender because I knew I was a ""boy"" and that I always had thoughts of wanting to be a girl that I couldn't do anything about, and because of that, I've been stuck in this weird limbo that prevents me from fully embracing a female identity or even when I was deep in denial, a male identity, and maybe it's all just a mind game. But I don't know.

I'm just kind of confused about how to identify, really. Any insights are appreciated."
himynamesname,asktransgender,"Hey, a bit confused and I'd love some clarity from this community.","Hey what's going on folks. I've lurked on this sub for a little today and you all seem like a really knowledgable and highly esteem pack. My question is a little embarrassing but I hope you guys could clear up a little of my confusion and drop some knowledge on me. So I consider myself a straight male , a boring cis male at that. I've always watched porn since a little tennager, but recently I've gotten into trans porn. I don't understand why there's a huge stigma in the straight community about it being deemed 'gay', when they're literally woman trough and trough. But I'd be lying to you guys if I didn't feel a little weird about finding transporn just as hot as any kind of porn. Maybe it's the difference I feel straying away from what's always been normal to me. But have you guys heard of it being common amongst males rubbing one out here and there to transporn?"
Pretty_Critter,asktransgender,"On personality, and trying to convince parents","**Backstory:**
I came out to myself as MTF in July. I'm still in the midst of working out my actual feelings, likes and dislikes, and separating them from dysphoria-related grumpiness.
When I came out to my parents (who live on the other side of the planet) in August, they did not take it well. After a week of talking hysterically to me about it everyday, and coaxing me not to take steps to transition, this fact was never discussed again, like it never happened (eg, my mom plans to buy more boy clothes for me). Also, they basically didn't believe it, especially because my behaviour and tastes don't deviate from masculine norms, and settled for blaming my discontentment on social isolation and depression.
I didn't let them get to me too long and I'm pursuing things like getting laser and going for informed consent appointments (will start HRT in Jan).

**Questions:**  I need advice on two things-

* How can I gradually ease into what I feel is my ""real"" personality? It certainly exists, and happens when I'm relaxed. The rest of the time is what I call my mind's curled-up-in-defence-mode (possibly what most people shelve under dysphoria) which makes me antisocial, curt, depressed and grumpy. This lets me ""deal with"" life but not enjoy it. Applying my fem and happy state of mind to real life (as opposed to fantasyland) is not yet coming naturally to me.

* How can I break the silence and respectfully and calmly ask for acceptance and validation from my parents? Our relationship has been good so far, and I have never had to ask them for anything, material or otherwise.

These questions are related because I'm going to be visiting them in a couple of months. When I do, I feel like I need to do and say things, even behave a certain way to drive home the point, but I'm not ready for it. Discussing transition with my parents quickly makes me defensive and assertive; and passionate confrontations are not fun for either party. If only I could talk to them with the full force of a confident personality, without going into my defensive mode. At the very least, it would shield me from any statements they make to undermine and cast doubt on my fledgling identity.

Thanks for reading and sorry for the infinite commas. I do realise concrete answers may not exist.

LilyFlowerr,asktransgender,trans girl vs genderfluid? has anyone else come out and then had to come out again??,"I've been transitioning for almost a year now. I've been so firm whenever I have come out, saying things like ""it's not a phase"" and ""this is who I am"". Which is totally true. But, now I'm struggling with the idea that I may be a boy and a girl as oppose to only being a girl. I'm worried that if I tell anyone this that they'll be skeptical and they won't valid my gender anymore. I'm worried my therapist and endocrinologist will take me off hormones.

Me being a girl is an easier concept for people to understand I guess even if people aren't always respectful. Like, my dad. If I asked people to use 'she/he/they' pronouns than I doubt anyone would use ""she"" even though I primarily see myself as a girl. I'm still happy with the new name that I've been using too and I always dress very femininely. 

Basically I'm asking, is it worth it? I don't want to be secretive anymore but I want people to interact with me as a girl too. I feel like I can't have both though. I'm also worried that this is a phase. Most days I feel like a girl but occasionally I feel like both a girl and a boy. Could this be a response to internalized transphobia? I don't pass almost a year in, in fact I'm not sure I'll be able to despite what my therapist says, so maybe this is like a defense mechanism. If I could pass completely as a woman than I would but I'm not sure whether I'd go stealth or also want to partially be seen as a boy too. 

Do you think it'd be safe to discuss this with my therapist? She's been very supportive but she's easily worried about me so I feel like she'd see this as a red flag. Usually these feelings of doubt dissipate quickly but I'm not so sure about this time around. Could this be a symptom of boderline personality disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder? I haven't been consistent with my identity for awhile. All I know for sure is that I'm trans, I'm at least mostly a girl, and I'm happy continuing my transition down the same path I've been taking.

I know this is a lot but any advice would be super appreciated. I feel pretty alone with this right now. So, thanks for your input!! I'm planning on coming out to everyone in a few weeks (even though my friends and close family already know) and I'm nervous that how I see myself with fluctuate and I'll have to come out all over again. I'm honestly embarrassed that I'm having these doubts now so I've been so confident about being a trans woman..."

so, at work, i still present male (but notreally trying to look male, just slacks with a button up shirt [even tho i need a bra now to contain the girls]) but since I told my colleagues, it feels weird when they refer to me as my dead name and male pronouns..... looking forward to the day where I am just 100% me at work and nothing else =)

She doesn't know this, but i think she's getting suspicious (said stuff like ""you sure know a lot about HRT""). But that's not why i'm worried. Talking about this stuff with a real person I actually know kind of solidified things. For so long, it's just been in MY head, and when i'm thinking about the evidence suggesting i'm trans, it's easy to do some mental gymnastics to justify how it's ""totally normal, you're definitely cis"". But when you hear someone else talk about essentially the exact same things you're going through, it makes you realize that this is real and sooner or later you're gonna have to deal with it. I'm just scared. I don't want to be trans. I'd kill to be cis. "

I wrote this just to get some stuff off of my chest. 

Just a few days ago I realized that I have always really Wanted to be female. 
My body and the way the way 
The world sees me 
Is not who I truly am. 
Not a male 

Now I am 25  
Years upon years   
Of deeply suppressed  
Truth viciously fighting  
Clawing its way to a   
Surface it had yet to find  
Years of ignoring the cuts and bruises  
Leave scars and callouses  
Within the mind   
But eventually these  
Feelings found  
A way  
  
Now the downfall and salvation  
Of my being  
Two forces  
Worked against the  
Behest of one another  
Have canceled each   
Other out  
  
My pragmatism has  
Kept me from ever facing   
What now confronts me 

Yet once I delve so deeply  
Into the depths  
Everything once sacred   
Is always worth losing  
  
Impending dysfunction  
Was and is my rallying cry  
Its stark meager   
Cavernous decrepit  
Yet an excuse to continue  
To not believe in anything  
Cannot be allowed to rule me  

Pragmatism allowed repression  
Its logical   
Call drew me in  
Ignore and continue on  
Nothing is worth   
That choice  
  
Failed   
It was never a choice   
Failed   
I was never brave  
Failed   
I was never anyone  
Failed   
I was never accomplished  
Failed   
I was never satisfied  
Failed   
I was never happy  
  
Success   
I found out   
Success   
I became brave  
Success   
I admitted truths  
Success  
I chose to grow  
Success  
I found fallacy  
  
Pragmatism it only  
Goes so far  
It can blind and  
Make your world into   
A tunnel leading   
To nowhere  
Where fear and self  
Oppression reign  

I cant believe this is where I am at  
But its who I am   
My anger   
My fear  
My lack of confidence  
My inability for follow through  
     inability to make a stand  
     inability to realize inner strength  
  
All stem from the fact that  
I am not able to realize myself   
As a man  

This is a little thing that I wrote to try and convey how I have been feeling since my realization. This is a recent revelation and I dont know how to cope or who to talk to so I am here trying. What are your reactions/stories? Please share.

Brjdge,asktransgender,Was/is anyone else obsessed with their feelings about their gender?,"I've been questioning my gender for some time now, probably around 8 months. When the idea of being trans first came into my life, I became unhealthily obsessed with it. I spent every waking hour questioning myself, ""checking"" myself to see if I'm really trans, monitoring my thoughts... I'd go back and forth between feeling affirmed and validated about my thoughts one minute and totally rejecting them the next minute, believing I'm tricking myself into feeling it. 

This went on for a long time. I spend about 8 weeks like that. It was mentally exhausting. At some point I decided I needed to slow down and the trans feelings faded a little. Some days it never crossed my mind. I'd still occasionally wonder but it was no longer a priority. 

A few months ago I started dating a trans guy who is absolutely lovely. Things are going great with him.  I shared my feelings about being trans and he said he'd help me with it. For a bit, I wasn't obsessing over it. It was relaxed and I'd let myself work it out in time. I was fine for a while but I had some bad days where I felt really gross about my body and especially my voice. A couple of days ago, he helped me crossdress and look really feminine. He said I totally passed as a girl with how I dressed that day.

Since then, I've become deeply obsessed again. I spend a lot of time researching and checking and monitoring as I described before. I'm obsessed with crossdressing. I really want to do it. I want to wear girl's clothes and I love wearing makeup. I feel really disgusted by this on occasion (probably because I live in a very heteronormative environment, as well as my entire family being heteronormative and rejecting the idea of transgender) but I genuinely feel sexy and attractive in girl clothes. I think about it all the time. Sometimes I wonder if I just want the label of trans/girl so I can wear that stuff.  I feel really comfortable and confident as a girl. I have pictures of me dressed as a girl and I want everyone to see them. I want everyone to know who I really am. I want to look like that all the time. 

This obsession is consuming my time and energy. I just want to know if anyone else can relate. I want to work through these feelings as fast as possible and that's why I'm so obsessed. I'm also so worried that I'm wrong but there's nothing indicating that I'm wrong about it. I feel good doing what I'm doing. "

Orion66,asktransgender,I'm a bit of an emotional trainwreck right now.,"Recently, I've been doing okay. I reconnected with some old friends from high school. We've been hanging out and playing D&amp;D at least once a week for the past month. I've also been more social at work, and have been hanging out with a few coworkers outside of work. Just two months ago, I had exactly one close friend. Now, I have at least a dozen. I've been actually enjoying school, and have been doing better in my classes because of it. Plus my anti-depressants have finally started working, so I've been feeling genuinely happy for the first time in years.

Despite all of this, I still broke down last night. I was just sitting on the couch, watching the new episode of The Flash. Nothing out of the ordinary had happened yesterday. I was feeling a bit tired, but that's only because I had gotten 4 hours of sleep Tuesday night. About halfway through the episode, a commercial break started. I usually just fast forward through them, but I was feeling kinda hungry. So, instead of skipping the commercials, I went to the pantry to grab a bowl of chips. After I had gotten my chips, I sat back down and grabbed the remote. Before I pressed the FF button though, a TV spot for a movie began to play. It was called ""The Edge of Seventeen"". I don't feel like summarizing it, so [here's the trailer](https://youtu.be/EB6Gecy6IP8). It's red band, so be mindful of where you are. For some reason, it absolutely fucking destroyed me.

I can't even really explain the tsunami of emotions I felt hit me after it ended. It was like a really painful mixture of nostalgia, envy, regret, and rage at the fact that I missed out on living my adolescent years as a girl, instead of as the dead husk of a boy I showed everyone else. I just let it out. I hit pause and sat there crying pathetically into my chips for a solid five minutes. Over a fucking commercial for a comedy film. 

I find it absolutely amazing that even now, when I'm generally happier than I ever remember being, gender dysphoria still manages to break me down every so often. It always seems to be catalyzed by the strangest, most mundane shit too. Like sometimes, I'll just be chilling in the student center at college, and a girl will walk by who's roughly my height, or has similarly colored hair, and it'll just ruin my day. I start thinking about how that's how I might've looked, if only my 23rd chromosome pair had arranged itself the way I would've liked. I always end up dwelling on that thought, and I make myself really depressed.

Does anyone else get broken up by stupid shit like that? Does the dysphoria ever get easier to deal with?

hse97,asktransgender,Do you guys think being supportive has started to go TOO far?,"First off, I want to say I appreciate support in all forms, shapes and sizes and I'm not trying to call anyone out, or make anyone feel bad about anything. I'm simply stating something I've noticed over the course of the past few years or so, and it's a growing concern especially for the Trans* community.


So recently [This Image](https://imgur.com/0zHjfKc) was posted to TiA, and love or hate that place, they do provide some interesting examples of support going wrong. The entire point of raising awareness of Trans issues and people is because we want to feel included. However, by trying to include Trans* people they've excluded so many more people and make them uncomfortable because their native language now has to be restricted. I know this is only one example, but I've see it more and more. My GSA in High School wouldn't let anyone use gendered insults, and since the people in that group became close friends and us being in High School, of course we made gendered insults. It's between friends yet we still got kicked out of our GSA despite being members since freshman year. Then, yesterday was National Coming out day, which is basically the one and only day I 'gay' out with rainbows. Someone started talking to me about pride and things like that when I say the word 'He'. Shit you not, that person got legitimately upset that I gendered someone who is most definitely and not ashamed of being a 'he'. Granted, I'm only two weeks into Hrt so it's not noticable and this person didn't know of my status, but its still bizare to me that a straight, Cis woman is getting more offended about something they consider a Trans* issue than I ever would. Then there was the TiA sign that made me want to post this. 


Honestly, it feels like pandering. It feels like this movement to never use gender'ed language to make US feel included is backfiring by not only excluding normal people and their normal language usage, but also because it seems to be that in the minds of a lot of people that using gender neutral language is the most important issue ever. Personally, I think it's not only hurting our image but it also sidelines more important issues such as rights to medication, anti-discrimination laws and raising awareness in general. 

Sorry for the rant, and maybe I'm an outlier, but It just feels like people are focusing on petty, and miniscule issues when there are legitimate and worrying concerns that the community should address before creating a Neutered language. /rantOver

Tl;Dr I think the gender neutral language push is hindering the communities image as well as not being a huge deal"

Lilstephanie,asktransgender,Is The Female Body Considered A Work Of Art? What About The Male Body?,"My mom is watching a Seinfeld episode tonight and Jerry is dating a girl who likes to lay around the apartment nude.

The male body is for getting things done......like a Jeep.  Michaelangelo painted and sculpted beautiful male bodies.  Famous nude paintings of women were often overweight.  I think being chubby was considered beautiful in those times.  But yeah, women bodies are considered more a work of art?  But is that because the artist painting the picture felt that way? How does this make both Trans guys and Trans girls feel?  I know it's all about body image and stuff like that.  Girls should look a certain way.  This might cause issues of self esteem.  Do Trans girls feel pressured to look a certain way too?  What about Trans guys?  If they aren't tall and muscular does this mess with their self esteem?  Can both learn to accept their situation regardless of what is considered the ideal male and female body?  Sorry this post is rambling and I'm probably making no sense!  It is very late at night. "
AutomaticLandslide,asktransgender,"I need sone help sorting out some things, would you mind giving me a hand?","I'm sure these are common things that people deal with but I just haven't found anything that has helped me so far. I'm pretty sure I'm trans but I don't want to be a fraud, and I can't stop worrying about it.

I'm 21, born male. I've been to an IC clinic and am a couple of hoops away from starting estrogen and blockers. But it keeps going around in my head that I'm not *really* trans. I have a couple of reasons for that.

One, I can, umm, orgasm, just from the thought of having a female body. In fact, these have been the *only* fantasies I've ever had, from the start. I'm always female in them, but that's it, just the thought of being female does it. This has me worried it's just a fetish, or that I'm just extremely attracted to women.

Two, I don't really *feel* like I'm a certain gender, I don't think. I keep seeing people's experiences, saying they have always felt that they're female or male, but I've never really felt either. I've had a desire to be female since I was 10 or 11 that has only gotten worse with age, but is that the same thing as actually being female? 

Three, jealously. I keep thinking that I might just be jealous of women. The attention, the beauty, the ability to share feelings and the acceptance of those feelings, etc. Most of my high school friends were women, and I was always jealous of how close they were and how much they enjoyed each other's company, and I always felt left out.

From the above I probably sound like a weird fetishist creep. But those are the reasons I doubt myself. Here are a few reasons that I'm pretty sure I *am* trans.

One, I often cry myself to sleep or curl up in the shower, sad because I can't stop thinking about being female. I close my eyes and imagine myself with long beautiful hair, a soft face and skin and a soft voice and 9 times out of 10 I can't hold back the tears. This also combines with jealously of cis women and well passing trans women sometimes. I like to read comics with trans characters, and the other day I found and was reading [Calogrenant](http://www.calogrenant.com) and when I got to the scene where she was transformed I just became overwhelmed with happiness, envy and sadness all at once and couldn't stop crying. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it for days. I could go on and on about this one, listening to Taylor Swift, imagining I'm her and lip syncing her, stuff like this always brings the tears.

Two, every time someone jokingly refers to me as female (I'm not out) like in an insult or something, I've always loved it. I put up a front like I'm offended of course, but it always makes me a little bit happy.

Three, there's always been this nagging thing in the back of my mind. Sometimes I can't pinpoint it. But I'm pretty sure it's my extreme desire to be female. Up until not that long ago I kind of ignored it, because I thought all men wanted to be female, and just never talked about it. But that's wrong, obviously. I really don't know.

Four, I hate being male but I can't really describe why. I can barely listen to myself speak because of how low pitched and monotone my voice is. I hate looking at myself in the mirror because, even though I'm not all *that* masculine, I still don't look anything near female. I hate showering, because I have to see *it*. I hate having to pleasure myself, because I have to touch *it*. I hate shaving, because it reminds me of the thick hair growing out of my face and everywhere else. I hate the way I smell, because it's stereotypically male. I hate the thought that I have to be the male in a relationship, and hate the thought of being the 'P' in 'PIV' sex. I could go on. And any little thing I do that makes me look a little bit more female brings tears of joy. But I don't know why I feel this way.

Well, that's pretty much it I guess. I'm sorry for the long, nonsensical post. I'm just very confused and I don't want to be a fraud. If anyone could find some kind of meaning in any of this rambling, I'd greatly appreciate it. I know you're not psychologists but I don't really have anyone to talk to about this.

Thank you. "

[""The Skin I Live In""](http://fmovies.to/film/the-skin-i-live-in.mr5p/l3xzz3)

Okay, so here goes.

Starring Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya, this movie is about a man named Robert (played by Antonio Banderas) who loses his wife and daughter, and copes with it in a very odd but unique way.

Robert loses his wife when she leaves him for his childhood friend ""Zeca"", who turns out to be his brother-in-law (which he never knows/realizes). So on the road together Zeca and Robert's wife get in a car crash, and Zeca survives and escapes, but Robert's wife is pinned and the car catches fire.

Arriving to save her moments before she dies from burning to death, his wife is bedridden for months, in a near vegetative state.

One day when she hears their 12? Year old daughter singing, she finally experiences a bit of joy, and gets up to investigate, only to catch a glimpse of her burn scarred face in the mirror. She throws herself from the balcony of their bedroom and dies right infront of their daughter.

6 years later, their daughter is finally socializing comfortably at a party, and the daughter leaves with a boy named Vincent to go for a walk in the woods.

He rapes her.

Robert finds her in the woods after the fact and sees Vincent leaving on his motorcycle. 

So with Robert's daughter now institutionalized for mental health issues, Robert resorts to finding this Vincent, and capturing him. 

It's never really explained if he knew what he was going to do with Vincent from the start or not, but we saw from earlier that Robert is some kind of scientist/doctor.

Well, eventually, Robert chloroforms Vincent and brings him to an operating room, and soon some other doctors/surgeons show up at his house in the middle of the night for an off the books operation of some kind...

When Vincent wakes up, Robert reveals that he has given Vincent a vaginoplasty... against his will.

Vincent has only had brief interactions with Robert until now, so Vincent finally gets Robert to explain why he's doing this, and Vincent gets this look of total hopelessness/defeat.

Vincent is now living locked in one of the rooms in Robert's mansion. 

A few of months later, Robert uses his advanced surgical knowledge to reconstruct Vincent's face to look like Robert's now dead wife (before the accident), and has given him breasts and softer skin, and some kind of Cricothyroid approximation surgery to alter his voice as well.

Soon he gives Vincent the name Vera, and begins socializing with him more and more.

At one point while Robert is away at work, Zeca comes to the mansion to seek refuge from the police due to a semi-botched heist operation, and quickly notices ""Vera"" locked away living in the room.

He finds the key, unlocks the door to her room, and after a brief struggle, ""Vera"" convinces Zeca that he's actually Robert's wife, and that Robert saved her and has her locked away because ""that's so Robert"", and Zeca rapes him.

Robert comes home just in time to see Zeca slumped on top of Vera, shoots and kills him, and Vincent hugs his ""savior"". 

Now that Vincent is in full stockholm syndrome mode, him and Robert talk about living life together with Vera just being his wife and fulfilling his fantasies.

She goes shopping with Robert's mom, and when she gets back one of the doctors is asking questions about the off the books vaginoplasty he helped Robert perform.

""Vera"" walks in and backs up Robert's claims, and the doctor leaves. But then ""Vera"" sees a picture of Vincent, and something snaps.

He acts like he's still fine, but later when they are about to have sex, Vincent leaves ""to get lubrication"", and comes back with a gun. He kills Robert and Robert's mother, and escapes.

He goes back to his family and explains what has happened to one of them, and it's shocking, and difficult, and complicated, but then another one comes in and asks what's going on... and he has to explain... again...

Cut to credits.

**Holy. Shit.**

Okay so first thoughts, this *might* be an homage to transgender people?

Stuck in bodies we don't identify with against out wills, and when we let people know that we feel that way, it's complicated, and difficult to get them to believe it, and we have to keep doing that for every person we care about... which sucks... like...alot.

Also, as someone who was molested/raped when I was 5 (I blocked most of it out and am not sure how far things went), I will say that this movie had alot of very emotionally disturbing... rapey vibes...

**But**, parts of it were in some strange way, kind of a turn on for me.

For instance, the notion that a handsome man is taking care of me, and making me a beautiful woman, even if for him it's just so that he can ultimately end up fucking me... well... Idk if I would complain about that...

\*clears throat\*

Anywho...

I feel like it would also be easier in some ways, if I could tell others, and even myself, that my transition was forced on me. It wasn't a choice, it just happened. 

It would take away alot of the shame I think, and yes I know that I need to overcome feelings like that on my own so that I can accept myself, but... idk...

Ultimately, I really enjoyed the movie, it was dark, fascinating, and hit close to home in some ways.

I just find myself feeling confused because I feel bad for finding anything positive or intriguing about Vincent's situation post capture.

Am I a bad person?

TL;DR: Saw a movie about a guy who raped a girl and then got forcibly transitioned into one as revenge by the girls father. I found the forced transition thing weirdly intriguing and I feel confused/ashamed for thinking it would be okay or preferable to be forced to transition (by a scarily handsome man for the purposes of being fucked by him, mind you).

Am I a bad person?"

Flat-sphere,asktransgender,The choice that's not a choice.,"This is something that been on my mind as of late, well since I came out to my parents.

I didn't choose to be trans. I even went so far as to try and 'choose' to not be trans. So i'm left with the choice of what do I do about it.

But it's not a choice, not really. Sure, I choose if I transition or not. If I choose to transition, then I have a chance at a better, happier life. But if I choose to not transition, I will not be happy and it will lead to my death. Not today, maybe not even in the next year. But I know it will, that one day i'll wake up and be so overwhelmed with it all, that suicide becomes an option.

Even know what my choices are, I can't make a decision to do the right thing. How do you make that first step towards transition?"

So, is the internal identity a soicial construct? because I feel like that ignores dysphoria?

Or, onto where I (uninformed cis guy) currently think it is:

Either in how we divide a gender spectrum (and the bits off to the side)?
Or is it simply gender roles/expression that are the social construct?

Questions:

1. Really how much water should I be drinking with spiro?

fleetinghorizons,asktransgender,Most people are anti-trans rather than transphobic. Is this your experience?,"So I don't exactly believe that I'm transgender but I do know I have extreme genital and social dysphoria. I dislike the gender divide but more specifically loathe the traditional form of masculinity pushed on myself from my parents, teachers, authority figures, and wider society. I also loathe completely my genitals. I see them as constraints to who I can be and really hate how people view me through filters when they call me a male and ridicule me for being feminine.

But back to my point, my experience has been online and talking with my male classmates and traditional African family and that they devastation (Yes, both my parents are devastated and my mother would rather get cancer and die than see me as ‘feminine’) stems not from religious beliefs as you may believe but the rejection of an identity.

Most arguments against transgenderism are either: religious oppositions, primitive binary-gender oppositions or primitive cultural beliefs. Aside from religion, the latter two are the ones I've always encountered. Even among the most liberal and educated of people.

 I don’t believe that most people don't fear transgender individuals like some may fear that gays will molest their kids Homophobia, is the fear of something. But from people I have seen online and in real life, there is this idea that has been taught to people that you have to ‘Accept your circumstances, and love who you are.’
It seems like a cliché, but I am sure that myself and many others looking for GRS are told this. The idea that you want to reject this gender structure that society has given us doesn’t make quite a number feel comfortable. Even among Christians, changing yourself in a drastic physical way is seen as a rejection of what ‘God has given you’, which I can’t take seriously.

This also is another common phrase that I hear ‘You’re still a man even if you chop off your bits and go on hormones. Nothing will ever change that’. Obviously people do not want to treat people as who they present even if it harms no one, except this belief system.  With this one, I just don’t understand why it’s so important to classify me as a male even though I don’t have external and internal male genitalia. So what If I have XY chromosomes? How does that affect me now?

tailcalled,asktransgender,What are we to make of the seemingly large number of 'magic button trans' people?,"Just something I've been musing on for a while...

'Magic button trans' is a phrase which refers to the people who don't feel much need to transition, but would do it if they had a magic button that could easily and seamlessly swap their sex.

These people seem relatively common; for instance, surveys I've made and posted to /r/SampleSize (latest one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/58kgcj/results_multiround_gender_survey_round_1/)) tend to find that a good chunk of cis people are magic button trans. As another example, [this](http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/cjhs.252-A7) study found something similar.

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/4xdldu/results_a_few_miscellaneous_questions/) survey, I generally found that peoples reasoning as to why is that they are curious about the other side, and that they think it'd be hot. In that survey, I also asked people what avatar they would choose if they were uploaded to a computer and lived in a virtual world. Few of those people specified that the avatar should have a different sex than they currently have, but it is very possible that many misunderstood the question.

In the data from [the survey I mentioned first in the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/58kgcj/results_multiround_gender_survey_round_1/), I can see that the people who'd press the magic button generally are fine with and often even midlly enthusiastic about their current sexed features, and they don't seem to consider their bodies any more androgynous than on average. They tend to be mildly enthusiastic or neutral about the way they're expected to present. Most of them are opposed to pressing a magic button that makes them highly androgynous, but they're less so than the general population.

Looking at /u/rmuser's list of [hidden signs of gender dysphoria](http://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/), they don't seem to be significantly more depressed than the general population. They tend to either believe that women are most affected by sexism, or that sexism hits both genders about equally, and they generally report being neutral-to-enthusiastic about the gendered ways they are treated. Most of them are young straight men.

The above makes me suspect that they're not trans, at least not in the sense we normally think of as trans, and that includes most variants of nonbinary I can think of. That said, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Some additional notes:

 * There does not seem to be fewer of them at very young ages (e.g. around 15-17), but it's hard to know for sure because I don't have a very good sample there. I don't know about younger ages, e.g. prepuberty.

 * I don't know how stable the response to the magic button question is, but I'll probably find out in some months or so.

 * A lot of cis people report that they would (unsurprisingly to most trans people) be deeply disturbed and want to change back if they magically woke up as the opposite sex one day. Let's term this group ""strongly cis"". Another group of cis people, sometimes called ""[cis-by-default](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/)"", claim that they wouldn't really care. Maybe magic button trans people are more closely related to cis-by-default people than to trans people.

 * All of this might be messed up by asking unrepresentative populations. YMMV.

 * If you have some theory about them that could be tested by asking them a question, then know that I'm planning on doing another survey with the same participants, so if you post your question here it's likely that I will include it next time."

livebeta,asktransgender,Spinning and spinning without getting anywhere,"Hi y'all


I'd like to remind redditors about the importance of not wasting emotional energy. Yes, your feelings are valid and they are real. But (tough talk here), do what you can to improve your lot (if you're doing nothing, don't complain about lack of progress), appreciate the little milestones which you've achieved (celebrate them in a logbook), and when you're down, open up that darn logbook and take a look! And keep your head down and keep pushing forward!


Spinning around and around in a cycle of (if ...this...I would have ...that) , dwelling on the past, or on things or events that we have no power over is just a *waste of energy*. It saps your strength for the stuff which really matters, like fighting dysphoria, oppression ( if applicable) etc which are *oncoming* (as opposed to stuff which has already happened and no amount of agonizing will ever fix). 


Please love yourselves and take care (and take charge! ) of your emotional energy

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,When would be the better time to have a conversation about transitioning with my dad who I (somewhat) came out to?,"Okay so a few weeks ago I came out to my Dad. And while I said ""im trans"", it kinda just devolved into ""im a confused teenager"". I was too scared to communicate just how strongly I felt.

And I got a doctors appointment soon where I'm gonna ask about a therapist. But I also wanna bring up transition to my medical doctor. And my Dad doesn't know that I'm that serious. He has no knowledge of trans things and like most people thinks that this is something that will be talked out and I'll move on.

But that's not the case, and I need to talk to him again. I need to explain how serious I am. I want him to know that I WILL need to change physically to be happy.

And I'm trying to decide the best time to do that. Should I tell him before the appontment or During? I don't imagine this being a ""Never, not in my house"" kind of thing, as last time I talked to him I expected the worst but it went well. 

And, maybe my dad's open verbal support could help the doctor take me more seriously. But at the same time I'm kinda scared. Last time I only told him I was uncomfortable and that I wasn't jumping to any conclusions. But now I have to straight up tell him that His son wants to be his daughter.


Should I work up the strength and pull him aside and talk to him, or tell both him and the doctor at the appointment that I want to transition?


Im starting to feel that burden of concealing things getting me again. I gotta do something soon. But I also don't wanna be stuck in unnecessary therapy that wastes time and keeps me from proper treatment longer than I need to be."
Amethyst_Julie,asktransgender,Distractions?,"please be prepared to read a f*cking novel... couple f bombs btw


I posted here a few weeks back (may be months now) a couple times about coming out, and I planned on doing it. So much shit has just come up and I think the main thing holding me back is distractions. I have so many things going on right now that i sort of need to rant about my life and get it all off my chest, then follow up with a question. So I realized I was trans over a year ago. This built up a lot of stress, dysphoria, depression, and anxiety. I already had been suffering with all of this (didnt realize i was with dysphoria till i realized i was trans) for months before, and for anxiety and stress, years. Over one year, these feelings have increased so much that I sometimes have these moments where I physically can't handle myself. My body heats up like a fire and I begin to think nothing except ""i want to kill myself"" and nothing but thoughts of suicide, like, im not talking suicidal thoughts, like SEVERE suicidal thoughts. I get so much anxiety, adrenaline, and i want to run away from myself and my thoughts. And I cant, so im stuck feeling like a psychopath. I get really bad anxiety whenever I admit anything about myself. I dont admit to my parents that I have ADHD, that I'm trans, that I'm depressed, that I'm suicidal, that I have severe depression and anxiety that I need medication for, and I dont want to tell them this. Why? I dont fucking know! Whenever I go to come out or tell them something, my body heats up and I feel like throwing up. I could just be getting nervous but this feels overboard to me. I want to come out more than anything right now. In my mind I can feel prepared as fuck but when I go to tell them I feel like crawling under a blanket and hiding from the world. This has taken such a toll on my sleeping patterns that I've begun to throw my blankets (heavy fuckin blankets) across the room in my sleep because I have such shitty sleep. This brings me back to another reason why I think I havent yet. Distractions. How do I cope with all this shit thats clogging my mind? I distract myself in any way. Which means I stay up late because I do something to distract myself until I pass out. Otherwise I'm alone with my thoughts and I can't even handle that anymore! I'm so fucked up that I don't know if I'll ever be fine, but I need some help with this. How can I not constantly distract myself? If I try, I'm stuck alone with my thoughts. Does this even make sense? I feel like I need to talk to a professional but I dont want to ask my parents if I can (because you can guess why -,-) anyway, if no one has anything that can help, thats fine because I dont think there's much that I can get help with. Hopefully I can somehow last till 18, but that seems like such a stretch, even being just two years"
Amy_of_Dallas,asktransgender,I'm struggling with some pretty bad dysphoria,"I've put off writing this for a while, but I have to get this off my chest. I posted this in Facebook last night, so I figured I'll post here too.

I'm struggling very badly with dysphoria, to the point where I've been crying myself to sleep virtually every night. This has been going on for a long time. I'm talking about both physical and social dysphoria here.

Physical: I'm never going to have the body I should have had. I have  a large frame, my ribcage is huge, I'm too tall, I'm never going to have hips, my feet are so big I can't wear normal women's shoes. No amount of transition can ever fix this. My boobs are way too small for my frame; they look comically tiny when my shirt is off. The boobs are the only things that might be fixable with surgery, but it'll be a long time before I can afford BA, and I don't think I can get results that look 100% natural. And then I have a small amount of dysphoria... down there, and I am not a candidate for bottom surgery for multiple reasons that I won't get into here. Oh, and my face is still horrendously masculine; it looks fine in the pictures I post because I'm good at cherry-picking camera angles, but trust me my face looks awful except in the cherry-picked angles I post here. Again, I'm not really a candidate for FFS: the recovery is not something I could ever go through.

Social: I transitioned too late to enjoy it. I wanted to be a girl ever since I was a kid, and since then I've watched every part of my life I wanted to live pass by before I actually got the courage to come out and transition. I hate hate hate being an adult with the fury of a thousand exploding suns, and I never got to live the parts of my life I wanted to live as my true gender. All I want is to get to be a kid again and to have the girlhood I should have had, but that's impossible. I'll never get to be the girl I always wanted to be, and it's only going to get worse as I continue aging. Every reminder that I'm in my 30s hurts badly. And no offense to anyone else here, but I've found that I just can't identify with 95% of people my age. Everyone else my age is enthusiastic about adulthood and happily dives into all the trappings of adulthood, while I want no part of it. I get lonelier and lonelier as I get older because I realize how unlike everyone else I feel about this. Oh, and I've been horribly lonely my whole life, too, because I was 28 before I ever told another human being that I was trans. Does anyone know how isolated I felt keeping the most important part of myself a deep, dark secret from my closest friends and my family. Three years after starting to tell people, the loneliness from the first 28 (almost 29) years of my life still eats at me.

I keep telling myself that in the next life I'll have the body and the life I always should have had, but I know that's a lie; I don't even believe in reincarnation. And I keep apologizing to the girl I should have been because ultimately I'm the one responsible for shutting her away and letting her wither and die.

I don't know what to do."
amon_erin,asktransgender,I need some quick advice,"I feel stuck today. I just showered and shaved and whatnot, but you can still see stubble on my neck and face. I need to go out and buy food, so I got all dressed and ready to go, but then I froze. I couldn't bear the idea of going out in public and looking like a guy. But I don't have makeup to cover the stubble and definitely do not pass. I'm kind of reluctant to just go out in my wig with all of these factors. I was hoping to try full girl mode last Saturday for dinner with friends, but backed out of girl mode because all I saw in the mirror was a guy in a wig and girls clothing. Any advice as to what I should do?"
EmilySeven,asktransgender,Does anyone else think that LGBT is the wrong place for trans people?,"Don't get me wrong, I don't have the slightest problem with any sexual orientation.

But putting a ""sexual identity disorder"" in the same place as homosexuality makes it really complicated for me.

Of course, adding the ""T"" to LGBT gave us a community. But it leads to the conclusion that being trans is somehow related to being gay. And that sounds so wrong...

Being trans means a lot of suffering. We're just ""the weirdest part of the community"" because no one understands. Not even we do. **We just feel the pain.**

**For me being trans is a biological misconfiguration that needs medical treatment to make me feel better**. It is more related to chronic pain or cancer than to ""being gay"".

...because gay people will never have to take any medications. They will not undergo a surgery to fix their problems. Actually, on that level, they don't even *have* any problems (if they're not trans, of course).

So... For many people being transsexual means being trapped in the wrong body. This can not be fixed with ""just a coming out and an accepting environment"".

The roots are deeper.

What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinion.

almerrick12222,asktransgender,I want to educate myself on how to properly approach address someone by their gender without misgendering them.,"Please excuse my ignorance. I simply want to be educated on this subject.  As I have more of my friends becoming transgender and I meet others that are also Transgender, I feel is necessary to properly address them to their gender. I know there are about 45 pronouns that address nonbinary. I'm still trying to properly formulate them in everyday sentences which can be difficult when I probably don't use proper grammar as it is.  My question is do people regularly use all the pronouns or is it fine just to stick with them or they,  and likewise? Also if someone is a transgender female should call her she and so forth, unless she corrects me to use another pronoun? I know I've misgendered people in the past and later was informed they were trans. I would like to hear your input on social etiquette. If I'm missing anything or should be informed on more,  please tell me. Thanks"

First she tried to understand and said that what is important is my happiness etc. But shortly after (like 15 min) she began saying offensive stuff such as ""You'll never pass with, you're a fucking giant"" or ""You're perfect everywhere, I love you, I want you to not do it, please"".  
After that I told her that she's basically a bitch for saying that and I thought that it would be the end. But then she began to ignore the fact that we are in a serious situation and despite saying that we'll break up, she'll just touch my dick saying how she loves it and try to cuddle me in order to have sex.  
Sometimes she'd threaten to suicide or whisper, repeating ""no you can't do that"".
We live together so I do my best to ignore her but it's difficult. I honestly think I should show her the door but then she'd basically be homeless...

Long story short, I found out my parents attended a meeting for LGBT parents a few days ago, and since then they've been trying to get alone time to talk with me. 

Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful that they are clearly making an effort to understand what's going on, I'm just 100% not ready to have that conversation, or any conversation about this with them. I also feel a bit of betrayal right now, because the only way they could have found out is if they followed me to my therapist or snooped on my browsing history. Both of which would be very unlike them, but they must have done one. (Or maybe I'm giving off subliminal signals? But I don't think so...)

I am still so far in the closet and just starting to get used to the idea of accepting myself, I'm not even close to ready for them to be involved in this. 

Are there any nice, non-confrontational ways to basically let them know they need to respect my privacy on this without actually bringing up the issue? I'm feeling so scared, like at any moment they're going to say ""we know you're trans"" and start trying to talk to me more about this and I just can't handle that right now!

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"

And I'm still ugly enough to crack mirrors. That's obviously never going to change for me. Goodbye dating prospects. Goodbye happy little life. Goodbye feeling like a total disappointment to my family. I'm just a waste of genetic material.

So now I'm thinking of stopping hrt. Of stopping transitioning. It's not working for me. I take the right steps but none of them are enough to clear the hurdles to a successful transition. I don't have it what it takes. I've failed at something else, what a shock.

Is this just a problem I'm having? Because if not, then we may have a problem. This is meant to be a place where people can talk about really personal problems, not a place where porn bots can run rampant.

TrulyRachel,asktransgender,Laser hair removal. Alexandrite is supposedly better but expensive and YAG is cheaper but better for darker skin. Which should I choose?,"Hi,
I'm an 18 year old trans girl and I've been looking at laser facial hair removal offers near me, Malaga, Spain. So far I've looked at two places:
One offers a 10 session groupon for 1000 euros over a period of 3 years. Their lasers are Alexandrite and diode.
 
The other place offers as many sessions as are needed over a 3 year period with an initial wait of 2 months between treatments and they adjust waiting time as needed. They charge 500 euros and use a YAG laser.

I have dark coarse facial hair and fair skin. Because of this I thought the first offer would be better as I've heard Alexandrite is better for lighter skin and darker hair whereas YAG is for dark skin. But I'd like to save money and go for the second deal if I'll achieve the same results.

I'm really confused over these two very different deals.
Will there be much difference in results? Are the prices good? What was your experience like?

Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks"
throwawaytransgirl24,asktransgender,My self written guide on one of the ways I knew I was trans whenever I had doubts or confusions (for others that ask this all the time ☺️),"**I see this question posted here all the time (am I trans? or is it this, that, etc...?)**

So I decided to give you a game I came up with for myself. It always helps me calm down and realize I really want this. I really hope it can help you and others too if you're having doubts or just a bad day. So I start by making a list of my daily and my favorite activities like this and try to live them out in my head.

1. Hiking
2. Camping with my friends
3. Work
4. Shopping
5. Watching TV
6. Eating out with friends
7. Working on side projects in computer science
8. Photography
9. Swimming
10. Taking random public classes like painting, etc.
11. Eating with my family
12. Gym
13. .... the list was like 20 or something long

Then whenever I had doubts I went over each one and started imagining what I would like it as and give each gender a rating. (The rating isn't important at all, it's just to make you think about it.)

Then I'd be thinking in my head like this:

1. Hiking

      This is all in my head, just showing the train of thought. I'd rather be a girl! I would look really good in Yoga pants and they're so comfy!!! Plus, people will be impressed at how fast I can climb and I won't look like a creep if I'm hiking alone. (not saying guys are at all, it's just a weird insecurity or phobia of mine that I always feel weird when other people look at me hiking alone as a guy)

2. Camping with my friends

      *thoughts* It would be so fun to sit by a campfire and have a girls night with some outdoorsy girls and talk about boys. On the other hand, it also sounds really fun with my boys. But I can still hang out with my boys as a girl, in fact, that sounds really fun. They've already accepted me as trans when I talked to them so this will be a yay! Definitely a girl here. Plus, a purple food container sounds really cute.

3. Work

      *thoughts* Well, I'd rather be a guy so I can seem more assertive. But being a girl wouldn't be that bad. I can wear something cute to the office though as a girl. That sounds fun! And I can always be like felicity from Arrow. I can be a super smart girl. But I can also be like Mark Zuckerberg as a guy and seem confident and really cool. Fuck! This one's a tie.

4. Shopping 

     *thoughts* Girl. Do I need to say anything here? :)

5. Watching TV

     *thoughts* I can do my nails while watching T.V., Girl!

6. Eating out with friends

     *thoughts* Damn. This one is hard... Pretty much the same as camping. I probably would be excluded from boys night when they go out to drink. Maybe I can make some cute girlfriends and invite them too so they'll let me back into boys nights. But eating out with my friends, that sounds totally cool. Tie I guess.
 
7. Working on side projects in computer science

     *thoughts* If it takes off, I'd be having a much harder time as a girl getting any investors. Boy would win here. But if I do it as a girl, I will be so cool! I might be on the cover of a magazine for women under 30...oh my!

8. Photography

     *thoughts* Girl of course! I can have a purse to carry extra lenses in.

9. Swimming

     *thoughts* Bikinis....Of course! Guy would be faster but I think I'd like looking like a girl swimming. *thoughts* I really hope I can pass with a swimsuit...

10. Taking random public classes like painting, etc.

     *thoughts* girls help girls. Guys help girls in class. I think this is an easy win for me here.

11. Eating with my family

     *thoughts* fff.....this is hard. It's gonna be so awkward with my boy pictures on the wall once I go full-time. And they're gonna feel weird. :( But this is bigger than just eating with them. They'll get used to it.

12. Gym

     *thoughts* oh yes! yoga pants and cute tops! Girl.

**Now for example for a MTF gym example, you have that. But for FTM:**

     *thoughts* oh yeah! free weights like a beast! all day :D Muscles, abs, and a happy trail (I think these are so sexy on guys hehe)

Again these are just ways of forcing myself to think about real life scenarios of what it's like being a transgender. It always helps me calm down and realize I really want this. I really hope it can help you and others too if you're having doubts or just a bad day. Again I'm no therapist and this is just a guide written by a 24 year old transgender girl going through HRT now haha so yeah it might as well be useless...but I HOPE it can help you.


Just be-you-tiful guys and girls! 

Love, 
Some Trans Girl"
maryjaneandnotmyname,asktransgender,How do you know if transitioning is right for you?,"How do you figure out if your day-to-day life would improve if you were to transition?

I realized I wanted to be a woman when I was about 15. I'm in my 30s now. Had dreams about it, imagine myself as one in both non-sexual and sexual ways, would like to dress as one and have done so in private. Enjoyed it but I don't know if it's an absolute requirement that I do it. Have been in therapy a bit before and stopped. I think I need to get back but I would like to get some opinions on here as sometimes hearing multiple points of view on something can be helpful.

I'm depressed, but I'm not suicidal and never have been. I don't really enjoy life in general. I don't enjoy being male but the idea of sex is not completely disgusting to me. I don't really like receiving complements on my appearance (and I do think I am a reasonably attractive man). I honestly don't even keep my appearances up very well, but I'm not a slob either. I don't really get happy when I see myself in the mirror. I don't like my genitals too much, especially the random erection crap (though I know that bothers many cis men too of course). I can use them but I imagine myself doing other things with other bits instead.

To repeat the words of another post I read on here, I feel like my body is just the vessel that I live in. I'm embarrassed to catch any sort of attention in any way. But I don't know if these things are all directly gender-related. I'm not sure if I don't care about social things very much or if it's gender-related. I don't try to be masculine or feminine. I don't know if being socially seen as female would help me with any of these things but if it could just happen instantly I would not be against it. Oh and I also have some mental issues going on... I have anger issues, for one. I've also got an overactive mind, can't sleep. Everything stresses me out. Going through life is a lot tougher than it should be for me, and I even feel bad about feeling that way since a lot of people have it much tougher.

I have no doubt that I am indeed trans... I think about it fairly often, want to take E and all that. One of the first ways I figured out is by posing to myself the question of whether I would choose to be born female if I could go back and have a redo. Well, I have thought about that question many times and I would always choose to be born female. So that's not a question to me. 

What I can't figure out is if transitioning will make my life better. Might E calm down my mind? Would I be better off being seen socially as female? Can I even handle the transition and any loss of friendship or employment it brings? Is there any way to get a good idea of what the best path is or is this just the point where one must decide to jump in (or not) and see what happens? This is a question that was asked of me in therapy (what do I see changing about my day-to-day life for the better) and it sort of stumped me. I'm not really sure how to become happy as a man, either, though.

I was hoping people could share some ways in which I could, or in which you did, answer this question.


Thanks!"

tumemanques24,asktransgender,Seriously confused.,"So, my husband told me about a month ago that he's transgender. I've known for about six months he cross dresses.

I'm hurt, I feel like my husband is dead, and this new annoying person has been chosen to replace him. This is all normal, I am told, for a spouse of a transgender person.

Last night, he told me ""I think I just want to be a man."" and I was like wait, what? He said that he doesn't feel like a woman all the time. He knows it would kill his family. His father would probably stop talking to him and most of his family is super Catholic. So, he's looking at losing his family. He told his mom and his mom basically sent him all these hateful messages. ""Do you really want to ruin this family?""

He says he's unsure if he's a woman. He wonders if he thinks he's transgender because he doesn't feel like much of a man because of his weight, lack of facial hair, etc. This past month I have been helping him, to the extent that I can, but now I feel more confused than ever.

I mourned my husband's death and now he thinks he wants to come back. I don't know what to think. What do I do?"

kyleco25,asktransgender,Rough beginning with my HRT,"Hi there,
I'm on my 3rd day of HRT as I'm writing. I've been told that it could have been a bit rough and scary at the beginning but I sort of freak out a couple of times already. I know that many symptoms that I'm experiencing are fairly common but I wanna ask your opinion anyway, possibly it could be comforting and reassuring.
Before I talk about the symptoms I wanna give some bio stats and HRT regime. I'm on my 30's and I'm a very athletic and healthy person. No background history of heart problems, no drink, no smoke, no drugs (I know, maybe a bit boring:)).
I'm currently on 200mg spiro and 4mg estradiol. I split the dose in mornings and evenings.
Here is a list of what I'm feeling...
1) mild nausea, especially true at the end of the dose window.
2) energy loss. Already at the second day in, I felt ""drained"". Literally, I can't run even half of the time I was running on the treadmill anymore. Same for lifting weights.
2) Weight loss. When I started I was 146, now in 3 days I'm down to 139. No matter how I eat, the weight it still going down. Being just 5'4"" I guess the weight range is ok for now but it freaks me out to see that it goes down so quickly. I'm aware that it's primarily water and muscles, but still...
3) Mild panic attack, palpitation, low blood pressure, sweat and insomnia. I left the best for the last.

What are your thoughts? I know I covered a lot, but before I'm gonna update my dr with this and ask silly questions, I wanted to touch base here first.

Again sorry for the length of the message. I'd appreciate any take and personal experiences on this. Thank you in advance.

(I'm not out to my parents and would prefer not to be for a while.)

However, this evening I thought things over and realised that my parents don't even check their insurance statements most of the time. I might be able to get away without them ever learning I've gone to the clinic. And if I call early tomorrow, there is still a chance I can snag an appointment time for something next week (otherwise, the earliest I could book them is for late November).

Do I take the risk?? It's literally either this, or DIY, or doing nothing."
ThrowawayTrans15,asktransgender,Can dysphoria go away?,"Ever since I realized I could be Trans I've done a lot of introspection. I remembered a period of my life (age 14-15) that seemed an awful lot like gender dysphoria. I prayed to be a girl every night, tried gender spells, and pretty much everything else. I gave up on this though as a possibility and mostly stopped thinking about it, until recently (age 20) when I found out that could have been gender dysphoria. If that was dysphoria, and dysphoria is biological, how can it just go away? Could it come back??"

MaxineLevine,asktransgender,I feel so Blargh,"I recently discovered this sub (like maybe a month ago) and even though it's been an amazing, eye opening experiences, it's left me with so many questions about myself, who I am, and who I want to be.  I've been going to therapy for a while about other things, and it's good to have someone to talk to, but it's different than talking to a friend.  One of my best friends passed away this year, and my other (who's also my ex - a whole nother story) has pretty much stopped talking to me - not because of the trans thing, but because she's ""too busy"" for friendships outside of work I guess. But I don't really have anyone to talk to about all the things I'm excited and scared about, and I'm not ready to come out to any of my less-close friends.  

It's not like I would ever want to hurt myself, or put my parents through what my friend's went through, but if I could just stop living, I'd be ok with that.  It's not like I want to die, but I feel like I don't want to be alive anymore, or if I am, I just want to hide in bed forever.  This isn't a suicide note, or a call for help.  I know things will get better, I just needed somewhere to vent, and I know you guys get it.  Anyway have a nice night and I hope you all get through whatever hard times you're dealing with.

I have a small mirror on my desk for makeup and no matter which way I sit, I turn it so I can see my own face. I get dressed and undressed in front of a mirror. Hell, I even check myself out in windows at the mall when walking through.

amon_erin,asktransgender,What am I doing?,"I feel like I'm stupid for continuing to take my HRT meds. I know this is early, and things have barely started. I want this. And I feel like I need it. But I feel like my dysphoria has gotten worse since starting HRT. I'm still fighting with myself about this, and I'm tired of fighting. Honestly, when the calm is there things are great. The calm makes me feel like this is something I don't want to stop. 

I thought I made some progress with my therapist yesterday because she perfectly described what I was feeling. That as I continue on the voice that says ""Don't do this! You're crazy for doing this!"" is getting louder. The thing is that I don't believe it. My reaction when I do occasionally give into it is that I just start sobbing uncontrollably. Even thinking about it makes me start to cry. Yeah, perhaps splitting my meds up would even out my mood, but I don't think that's going to fix everything. 

This seems to get worse during the week at work, and especially if I go out and get called sir. That happened at the store tonight and I was just about ready to give up. I feel like I'm stuck between being misgendered as male in boy mode, and probably being misgendered/putting myself at significant risk for violence by being visibly trans in girl mode.

So what am I doing? Am I stupid for doing this? 

Ugh. I'm so tired of bothering you awesome people. I need to go away for a while, I guess."

Naturally I stated that I don't agree with him, and was planning on leaving it at that, since we clearly don't see eye to eye.  He then proceeded to drop the ""omg it is biology 101"" line, at which point I had to seriously debate how much I was willing to reveal in order to call him out.

I wound up going with the ""you can't just ask everyone what their genitals are"" line, but man for a minute there I was so fired up I wanted to come out on the spot. I have told myself I want to tell very close family first (the people I am out to were spur of the moment and unplanned), or I might have done just that. I have to admit I do feel more motivated to come out just to start educating people with the massive amount of knowledge/understanding I have gained myself recently.

I hate having to pretend like I haven't researched sexual biology and gender to the end of the Internet and back, and potentially answer questions about why I know so much.

Thing is though, I've noticed a lot of the dancers are usually really femininely built, and are fairly busty. All gorgeous. And I'm none of the above (despite what what the friend tells me). I'm fairly flat chested (B cup, but on my rib cage it looks fairly flat) and otherwise my features don't lend well to the look and charm and stuff. ._.

Context:

So, I'm on day four-and-a-bit of HRT (Progynova 2mg, 3x a day) and have already noticed some changes that I was not expecting for at least a few weeks.

**Day 'bit':** I only had one pill on this day, in the evening at around 7pm. At about 8:30-9pm I noticed some subtle changes in my emotional state, nothing major but I just felt, Iunno.. Like I was 'switched on', somehow. I put it down to psychosomatic effects, because I couldn't conceive of hormones inducing noticeable changes this quickly, so it seemed obvious that this was in my mind.

**Day 1:** Nope, those feels are real. All. Fricken. Day. I'm not complaining, mind you. It was lovely to experience my own emotional state throughout the day instead of merely observing it from afar. It's just not something I was expecting to happen this quickly.

**Day 2:** What a lovely day for HOT FLASHES.

**Day 3:** ALL OF THE SMELLS. Everything smells different, richer somehow, and some previously unpleasant scents are now far less offensive than they used to be. Including ...man-smell...? What the fuck?

Also, my new state of feels already seems normal now.

**Day 4, morning:** While washing my face during my morning shower, I noticed two things: The skin on my cheeks felt softer and more supple, and the cheeks themselves felt more rounded and 'springy' somehow.

**Day 4, evening:** I'm feeling this weird sensation on my chest, like a kind of slow electric shock every now and then that sparks along my chest skin, settling at the nipple before dissipating. It is not painful or uncomfortable, but it is definitely noticeable. I described the sensation to a cis woman friend and her response was ""woohoo, yeah!"", so I'm pretty sure I know what this means.

Tomorrow is day 5.

Is it just my imagination, or is this happening unusually fast? Everything I have read has suggested timeframes of weeks for some of these changes, several weeks or even months for others.

Edit 1: Formatting

**Edit 2: Update 1**

It is now Day 20, so for interested future readers, this seems like a good time to update this thread with details on how things are progressing, because a few things I have experienced are things I have not read about anywhere.

**Emotional state:** Still relatively calm living within my emotions. No sign of mood swings *as yet*, we'll see how this develops.

**Hot flashes:** Gone by day 7. Everything I've read says that hot flashes are the result of rapid shifts to hormonal balance, and my experience here backs up that notion. I expect more whenever the endo I'm seeing changes my meds.

**Skin:** Facial skin is still noticeably softer to the touch than it was prior to hormones, and other areas on my body which always had soft-ish skin are also now responding similarly. Inner-upper-arms, wrists and the skin on the back of my hands are the most noticeable changes because I touch them regularly, though inner thighs and the non-hairy part under my booblets are also affected. Most everywhere else is either still too furry to tell, or has not yet responded to HRT.

**Cheeks (facial, obviously):** For about a week from days 4-11, my cheeks were noticeably puffy. Towards the end of the week, the muscles *under* my cheeks began to flex and twitch of their own accord, especially on the right side. This seems to have been an initial response flare to the estradiol which gave rise to most of the effects I noted on day 4 in my original post, and most of these effects have since settled down. There is still some noticeable puffiness just under the cheekbones however. This is most noticeable when I smile, which I find myself doing much more often than I used to. :)

Also, my dimples came back. &lt;3

**Scent:** Yep. Everything still has a smell, and they are ALL in my nose.

**New:**

**Muscles are shrinking already?!** This may be partly due to diet (I accidentally started a low-protein lazy-paleo diet on day 1), partly due to my sedentary lifestyle (I work in IT/software development, and my exertion is mostly limited to moving a mouse across a desk much of the day), and partly due to the fact I started with a very low baseline T level (80) prior to HRT. It's also possible that the apparent loss of muscle bulk is due mostly to fat mass being consumed in muscled areas, leading to a leaner sit of the muscles on my frame. So take this point with a cup of salt.

**Socially:** I should preface this point by noting that I am *not* out yet, socially.

Women I interact with have always been friendly towards me, though some may at first appear to feel wary until they realise I am the categorical opposite of 'dangerous'. I always assumed this to be due primarily to my frame and apparent maleness. Now though they seem even more friendly, random women on the street avoid me less frequently, and some acquaintances who would rarely say more than 'hello' are now openly discussing topics that would typically never be discussed with 'a guy': period pain, boob pain, how frustrating it is that tops typically fit either boobs or hips but not both, etc.

My interactions with men have also changed dramatically. I used to always feel somehow inadequate, like I was some not-a-man impostor, living behind enemy lines, learning the secrets of their culture for some nefarious reason that was unknown even to myself. Physically there was never an issue with blending, but personality-wise and psychologically I have never fit into that culture. Now that I've internally let go of the need to 'conform enough to blend', I am more authentically myself even while presenting as male, in terms of personality expression, and I think I have come to dislike masculinity a little less as a result.

These social changes are probably purely psychological, but the trigger to the psychological change was probably either the choice to take estradiol, or of the estradiol on my brain and emotional centers.

Lastly, lots of people seem to be giving me second- and third-looks on the street for some reason I cannot fathom.

**Other effects of note:** I'm just going to list the effects I have experienced in point form, because I am running out of time for the day. D:

- Muscle aches in thighs, calves, abdomen &amp; lumbar areas, entire upper torso area, upper arms. Varying degree &amp; duration, not usually difficult to tolerate
- Posture is changing subtly. I tend to slouch less and center my weight over my hips more when sitting
- Interest in social activity is increasing
- Everything tastes sweeter. As a result, I have cut non-natural-state sugars from my diet entirely (I still eat lots of raw fruit though)"
SlicedItalianBread,asktransgender,Is it a bad idea to delay starting hrt?,"Hey all, I finally was able to work up the courage to come out to my parents a few weeks ago and stuff has been a little rough to say he least. Basically they told me I can't start hrt while I live with them and that they can't stop me from doing it when I move out. Ok fair enough the thing is I most likely won't be financially stable for another year, I'm 19 and just now getting the courage to do this but I'm not very feminine looking at all. I suppose I could self med for a while until I move out and hide it... 

Anyway I guess my question is how late is too late to start hrt?"
__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Coming up on 2 mo. hrt -- update + questions?,"I'm a few days away from 8 weeks on estrogen! A lot has happened since day 1. I spent the first six and a half weeks on 2 mg of E and 100 mg of spiro per day. As of about a week ago, my daily E dose has gone up to 4 mg. Hopefully more E means more changes?

Noticeable Changes:

* Tiny boobs: I had small buds before starting hrt, and they've gotten a lot larger. Idk if they even count as an A cup yet, but a teeny bra provides enough padding for them to be noticeable. I can't wait until they're big enough to actually have some cleavage (if they ever get that big...).

* Smell: I smell different in a few places. My armpits are more or less the same, though.

* Face: some combination of getting better with makeup and being on hormones has made my face significantly more passable. I was extremely lucky, and was basically passable from day 0, but I feel a lot better about how I look now.

* Libido: Decreased. Occasional erections still, but not right when I wake up anymore.

I've also experienced some soreness in the testicle region. Presumably that's a sign of stuff happening? I haven't really read about that anywhere though. And I haven't actually noticed too much shrinkage or anything. Maybe a little, though? I dunno.

Also tucking is still hard. I don't do it, really. I wear two pairs of fairly unyielding underwear, usually. Even though that helps, I still can't really wear much unless I'm either wearing a skirt, or a long top to cover the crotch area. I really hate having to do that. All I wanna be able to do is just throw on a pair of yoga pants and go. Maybe in a year or so, when things are small enough to not really be visible, but not right now :( The moral of the story is that I REALLY FUCKING HATE HAVING A DICK, DAMMIT. It's really the main source of dysphoria, now. I get pissed about my bits and then take it out on other people, and I don't know how to deal with that.

raphmer,asktransgender,talked to my mother today [rant],"sooooo, I´ve been with my mother today and then she came up with transgenderism.
She said she´d be supportive and she knows that I´ll start HRT in about a month.
However, today she said ""does that mean you´ll come over with make up, lip stick and so on?"" ""Will you put on dresses?""
I don´t know why, but this hurt me very much. It felt so degrading and it made me feel totally insecure. Just like if being transgender was only about clothes and so on, so I told her that this could be, but my sisters don´t wear make up all the time, and they wear trousers as well.

Later on, she then said that she met a boy who looked male but acted female. ""He must have changed to the same side than you did"" was what she said afterwards.
Although she said that she´d support me, I feel like she doesn´t really get it. It felt so degrading and right now, I´m pretty much smashed into pieces. I feel totally vulnerable and that I can´t start HRT because I´m way to ashamed to present fully female one day.

Furthermore, she then said that you´ll always recognize ""men"" and that they cannot pass. She´s seen some of them a couple of years ago and that you could immediately see that they´re not genetic females. Anyway, this didn´t hurt that much because you wouldn´t recognize a passing trans woman that has gone stealth.

What was even worse is that she said that I will never be respected as a teacher when I look like that. Transgender persons can´t have the authority and that probably nobody wants to have a transgender teacher.

I had to share this with you, because it hurt me so much and I´m feeling really down right now. I hoped this would get so much easier, hoping that she´d be supportive and understanding. She wasn´t angry, neither did she try to stop me from it, but it hurt anyway. Right now, I can´t imagine to present myself as female sometime because she made me feel so insecure. :-/

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,Does my face look pale enough for laser?,"I had a consultation at a local spa over a month ago and she said she couldn't laser me because I was way too tan (thanks Poke'mon Go). She said to come back in a month after being really careful of my exposure, ""I need you as pale as you'd be in the dead of winter"" is what she said.

Well, immediately after that I found how most people transitioning is using Groupon, definitely more affordable. But unfortunately it's only for places that are around 90 minutes away from me. And they also require a consultation!

So I'm here to ask you guys if you think I look pale enough. I'm still a little tanned in the face but i think 1 month of hormones may have helped lighten it up a little. If you look down on my shoulder, you can see where the tan stops at the collar and see me true paleness, if that helps any.

http://imgur.com/yzVPgvT

I want to know how much of a chance I stand to be able to go in and get my first round of laser on the day of my consultation. I only say this because the consultation lady at my local spa said if I were pale enough she would've started. I don't want to drive 90 minutes just to find out a yes or no answer. Thanks!"
tacomilitia,asktransgender,What age is best to start HRT?,Or is there a legal minimum age to start or what?
ashleydawninPA,asktransgender,"Mothers, sisters, and wives","Three ciswomen in my life, and the story of their surprising responses, and a general ask for ways forward and where to go from here. I initially was eminently fearful of coming out to one of these three, while the other two I hoped would be understanding and supportive 

So I came out to my wife on 9/16. She was upset initially, and yes we are going to divorce, but she's become a really strong source of support. I am so lucky to have her as my best friend. We've come up with a mutually agreeable timeline - getting her propped up financially and into her own place while she starts her new job, and settling the kids arrangements (they will be with me 3 days a week while she's on shift) - before starting HRT/doing any outward presentation. ETA on that is mid 2017 which works for me.

I then blurted out (via text) a 3 paragraph long coming out message to my sister the week after. I went into great detail about my feelings and how it was awkward for me growing up because all I wanted was to be her sister etc, which admittedly is a little weird to see in text format. She goes and blabs to my mother, crying about how weird it is and how she won't know how to talk to me anymore. She also told her boyfriend about it, commenting ""you better marry me quick before he does anything. I don't want my friends seeing that""

My mother. Oh where to begin. So not knowing that my sister told her already, I call her to break the news. I proceed to get lectured for an hour about ""while I support you and love you, you can't do this right now. You have children."" Apparently in her mind, transitioning with young kids (7 and 2) is the worst thing I could possibly do. She called me selfish and told me ""you don't get to do this. You made a decision to have children, and you need to honor your commitments"" while heaping guilt on me about how she stayed in a loveless marriage for my sister and I. She berated me about telling my sister, and various other garbage. 

Fast forward to this week. My mother decides to call my wife unprompted and starts to unload all this sympathy for her, telling her how she should ""keep me from seeing the kids"" if I transition, and that divorcing me ""is a great idea."" She even said that I should ""move far away and cut off contact"" and let the kids come to me when they make up their own minds about whether they want 'that' in their lives. She even went so far as to tell my wife (not me) that if I transitioned, she would ""never forgive"" me.

My wife relays all of this to me when I get home from work and is just beside herself. Again she reaffirms that she supports me and will never disallow me from the children, and wants to remain best friends.

I really feel awful that I'm likely going to have to cut my children off from their only grandmother (my wife and her mother are estranged already), but I simply can't have them around her for fear of her filling their minds with negativity.

xxxiskoo,asktransgender,Not typical trans narrative.,"There's been something bothering me recently, and it makes me doubt myself actually being transgender alot. There's so much pessimism and negativity on these threads from people with depression and serious mental illnesses, and I may just be cherrypicking, but I doubt myself being trans alot because it's so easy for me to enjoy life. I feel like if I really had dysphoria then I wouldn't enjoy life so much. It's not just that, I actually like my body how it is now for the most part. I just feel like being a girl would be way better. And I'm 100% sure I'm not doing it for the attention or that being trans is ""trendy"" or whatever.

Anna_the_potato,asktransgender,Are my T levels going back up? (NSFW),"So like a month and a half ago, or so, my NP upped my dosage of spiro, by a lot, and actually, that made me feel a lot better as far as effects go. I had so much spiro that the pharmacy gave me two big ol' bottles worth of spiro.

I ran out of the spiro in the first bottle about a week ago, and I've started on the second bottle.

Within that same timespan, I started to work out in the mornings. I usually take my spiro/estrogen right after running for a bit.

Now, the reason why I suspect that my T levels might be rising a little are the following:

A) I've been having little dysphoria episodes over the past week. Very painful, hard to deal with, can't-believe-I-used-to-feel-like-this-all-the-time dysphoria. Very odd since I've had fairly little dysphoria since my spiro dosage was upped.

B) I had a brief moment where my libido came back, just earlier today. Now, normally, when my libido very briefly visits from its grave, I just get semi-hard and masturbate a bit, and half of the time I don't even orgasm and that's fine with me. But this time, I got fairly (almost painfully!) hard, and once I orgasmed, a teeny tiny bit of, uh, stuff (super teeny tiny) came out. Normally, when I orgasm nowadays, I basically sort of leak a tiny bit of fluid over the next hour, but this time it was...... not too dissimilar from looking like a tiny, tiny glob of old school....stuff. And it made me feel really horribly dysphoric to see that happen.

Could my T levels possibly be going back up, for some reason? Could it be the timing of the exercise? Or maybe something to do with the new bottle of Spiro? Is there anything I might be able to do to resolve it?"

Izzabe11e,asktransgender,I just saw a year old interview with Caitlyn Jenner on Youtube. The comments are so disgustingly transphobic it made me cry. What have we as a community done to warrant so much hate and mistrust towards us?,"[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqLG3myKUk) the interview. Just read through the comments and try not to feel offended or upset. 

I'm not even talking about the video itself, I'm just so shocked that so many people think that way. I'm not saying this is the first time I've been exposed to such transphobia, but it's still horrible to read.

It's not just ignorance towards us, it's genuine hate. What have we done to deserve this? :(

Out of all the bigoted and hate fulled comments, the one that hit me the most is this: ""I think transgender people are just males who really really really want to be female, or females who really really really want to be male. I am not buying the girl in a boy body or boy in a girl body thing.﻿""

It's just such a stupid and arrogant attitude. It sums up the ignorance is bliss pandemic that has plagued the world for so long to a T. 

I suppose I'm just ranting, but does anyone else ever come across something so transphobic while so unprepared for it that it basically ruins your day? "
Sys32unix,asktransgender,Anyone have thoughts on the C12 bill?,"This is a Canada thing.

meridia89,asktransgender,Breasts,"Is it important to want to have breasts?

I mean I sometimes look down when I have a bare torso and do my shoulders forward and then I think huh they're almost like breasts (of a ten year old...) (for clarity I mean where my breasts would be not my shoulders...) and sometimes I grab and there is nothing so I just put my hands on my chest and it feels kinda awkward like when you pick up a flask full of water but it is actually empty.

But I can't imagine myself with breasts my chest is really really really wide so they would look really weird, especially if they're big (like [this (nsfw obviously)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Weibliche_brust_en.jpg) is very big already, I couldn't hide that), it would be like someone sees me ""hey they have a breast"" *turns 90 degrees* ""oh wait they have two"". I'm afraid that if I take HRT I will just become a guy with breasts that I can't hide, that is my biggest fear (well one of them anyway). And big breasts would be really uncomfortable I think, they would be like a cart behind a car. I'm afraid that if I say all this to my therapist they'll say I'm not trans.

It is strange I really hate my thing down there and want a vagina, but I don't really mind not having breasts. Maybe it's just easier to imagine something to not be there than to be there? Or is it something else?"
1st_transit_of_venus,asktransgender,"If you have a history of back pain, how did it change under HRT?","I would like to hear from everyone, but I'm especially concerned with the impact of muscle loss resulting from estrogen therapies.  

I herniated a disc about 10 years ago, had an MRI, went to physical therapy, and over the years prior to coming out managed my back pain with stretching, exercise, yoga, etc.

I started Spiro/Estradiol 10 months ago.  At around 6 months I started to experience some mild back pain, and I developed leg pain I never experienced before HRT.  The pain grew worse over time, and by 8.5 months I couldn't stand or walk for more than a few seconds without intense pain.  I had to quit my job because of it, and in the 1.5 months since there's been little improvement.

I saw a neurologist recently, and they seem confident that muscle loss is the cause.  I did lose a lot of muscle by month 6 and the pain gradually worsened from that point, so that evaluation makes sense to me.  I'm starting to exercise more now but I should have started months ago.  I don't want to scare anyone, but if you're on E and have a history of back pain you should give some extra consideration to your back and any exercise regimen you have for managing back pain."

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,I'm in a state of shock at how badly my appointment with my Endocrinologist just went. I'm not exaggerating when I say she very visibly hates me. I didn't know doctors could behave like this to their patients.,"So a little backstory: last week I got my blood tests, and my T levels were too high and my E levels were too low, when compared with the guidelines issued by the VA, Endocrine Society, UCSF, and so on, and my Endo (who I've been communicating with entirely through email) was adamantly refusing to put me on Progesterone or alter my dosage.  I [asked for advice from asktg](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/55snme/my_overly_restrictive_endocrinologist_thinks_that/), and also talked to a case manager with my insurance company, Kaiser Permanente, inquiring about getting a second opinion or even a new endo.  My case manager suggested that I meet in person with my endo, see if a face to face conversation could help move things along when I presented the guidelines listed by these other organizations compared to my own levels, and if it didn't work out, then she would sort out the second opinion or new endo.  I said that sounded like a reasonable plan, and together with my case manager, we made an appointment for me to see my Endo Friday at 4pm.  I.E. the same day that I posted this thread.  This appointment took place a week after my blood test.

I showed up at 4pm, and was ushered into an exam room at 4:15pm.  A nurse was confused about how to put in her computer that I wasn't menstruating (because I'm a female in their computer), but that it wasn't a problem.  At 4:26pm, my Endocrinologist came into the exam room.  On her face was a look of exasperation and anger.  She looked at me and said ""I have a patient at 4:30.  What do you need?"".  I was flustered at this; I've been on hormones for 15 months, and the last time I saw her was 19 months ago, when I was pre-HRT.  I had thought that she would want to check on my progress, see how I'd been developing.  Disarmed by this, I stammered out ""I'm doing good, how about you?"", which was the thing I was going to say when she asked me how I've been doing (as doctors usually do).  I grew uncomfortable, and reached into my purse backpack to pull out some of the notes I had printed out on hormone ranges and progesterone and injectable estradiol.  I tried to inject some levity into the situation, mentioning how often I had to tell nurses that no, I don't want to get a pap smear.  This attempt fell flat.

I slowly and cautiously told her that I'd like it if I could increase my Estradiol levels.  She snapped at me.  ""I told you what the range is for Estradiol.  It's 70-150 pg/ml.  You're already at 82.  You're already in the right range!"".  I said yes, but I'd been talking with my transgender peers, many of whom have Estradiol levels that are between 125 and 200.  She became angry at this, and told me that having Estradiol levels at 200 is extremely dangerous.  I told her that I'd been reading up on target hormone ranges, and I'd found [many sources that recommended different ranges than 70-150pg/ml](http://imgur.com/prU8sSk).  Since she's a Kaiser doctor, I started by referencing the Kaiser Permanente Gender Pathways clinic in San Francisco, co-founded by Dr. Metz, which lists a range of 50-200pg/mL, before mentioning the VA, Endocrine Society, UCSF Center for Excellence for Transgender Health, International Planned Parenthood Federation, Boston University School of Medicine Endocrinology, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists.  I mentioned that some of these sources listed a figure of &lt;200pg/mL, and one recommended 125-200pg/mL, and another recommended 80-140pg/mL.  I said that given all these various target ranges, I would like it if I could get up to an Estradiol level of about 130pg/mL, thinking that this represented a good average amount that would fit in all these target ranges that were listed.  Frustrated, she told me that when taking Estradiol patches, hormone levels fluctuate greatly, and that I seem to be getting the effects of the hormones, so what did it matter what the blood tests said my hormone levels were at?  I wondered how she knew what effects I was getting, since she hadn't ever examined me, and this was the first she'd seen of me in 19 months.  I was hoping that she would examine me to see if I was having normal breast growth, but given the hateful look in her eyes, this seemed laughably out of the question.  Then she said you know what, I will increase your dosage.  I'll bring you from 0.15mg patches to 0.2mg, and while she said it, she had this haunting look of simultaneous anger and bitter sadness, and I could see tears in her eyes.  I felt the urge to ask her if she was okay, to tell her no, I'm sorry, you don't have to increase my patch dosage, I didn't mean to hurt you.  I stayed silent.  I have never in my life seen a doctor nearly succumb to tears when I asked them if I could slightly change my prescription dosage.  Certainly not while at the same time they were showing visible anger towards me.

I asked her her opinion on estradiol injections.  She got that look again.  She told me that injections make your estradiol levels fluctuate between...I guess it was 50pg/mL? And upwards of 3,000pg/mL.  She asked me if I knew how  dangerous that was.  She gave me a look that said ""Are you going to ARGUE with me over this? The lunacy of taking estradiol injections?!""

I didn't bring up progesterone again.  It seemed utterly futile.

I'd say that for about 75% of the office visit, her eyes showed a disarming contempt and anger for me.  It was extremely uncomfortable.  She behaved in a way that made me feel like I was something foul that she had stepped on and was trying to scrape off of her shoe.  At the end of the visit, I walked out of the office, back into the main waiting room, and slumped into a chair, utterly defeated, a look of confusion on my face, and wondering what the hell just happened, for about 10 minutes.  I'd never been so uncomfortable during a doctor visit before, not even when I was 13 and given a digital rectal exam by a doctor, and screamed and screamed.  In a daze, I took an Uber home, feeling like my pet had just been run over by a steamroller.

Guess I need a new Endo.  I guess that also means I'm rolling the dice, and might get another one who's terrified of trans women patients having anything above 100pg/mL of estradiol, and of progesterone.

I had no idea that my doctor felt this way towards me.  Although I've only seen her in person once, it seemed before that she could tolerate me.  In late 2015 we were discussing the results of my hormone tests and fertility tests and chromosomal analyses from prior to and during hormone therapy, and that was when she told me that in her view, I had some undefined form of Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, a rare intersex condition, but that it had gone undiscovered until now, when my infertility was examined along with my undermasculinization despite normal levels of male hormones.  She didn't seem so hateful towards me then.  When, months later, I asked about abnormalities in my genitals that might shed some light on the situation, she referred me to a Urologist to be examined.  She didn't seem angry then either.  It was only after this last blood test, when I pointed out that my hormone levels seemed out of range of the guidelines given by various other professional groups treating transgender patients, and requested micronized progesterone, that she seemed to become hostile.  I guess she really really hates it when patients request that their dosage be changed.

I never expected this.  This horrible, adversarial relationship with my Endo, where I show up, and she glares at me, hatred in her eyes, and I ask her to increase my levels to ranges that are in line with what's recommended by knowledgeable institutions, and she boils over with anger.  I wonder if it's common for trans people to have this relationship with their Endos.  Like they're your ex spouses in addition to your doctors, but in the divorce settlement you got the house, the kids, the dog, 75% of the money, and alimony.  Shame I don't drink, I could certainly use one right about now, to forget that horrible experience.

Kannoss,asktransgender,Does anyone else get uncomfortable when something asks you what your preferred pronouns are?,Idk about you but i always get anxious about them because i want to answer honestly but if i do i would get outed which just serves to  make things worse and less of a safe space.
Netherwalk,asktransgender,A previous doctor virtually told me to pray the gay (trans) away (trigger warning?),"Is that like... malpractice or attempted something? I don't want to write my life story or anything, but I'm an intersex person and I got my transition letter 4 years ago (after counseling for a year+), I'm 25 now. I had partially transitioned for a year and stopped because I wanted to give college a try without issues and had pressure from my dad to stop; I have begun transition again as of late. The doctor I had went to this year, before the new one who's helping me right now, literally told me that ""all trans-people are mentally unstable and depressed."" She whipped out some Jesus-freak nonsense on me too, that transition is the Devil's work and implied that so are my intersex problems I grew up with. She even offered to give me Testosterone because of my messed up natural hormone levels and feminine look, despite being transgender. Yes, a licensed MD said and did this shit to me. 

After I politely refused the T, nodded my head and kept smiling to appease the warped Christian BS (my mom was in the private room with me, seething and ready to turn it into a Jerry Springer episode), she told us to go to church and pray it away, we just kind of awkwardly left in quiet anger. I don't know what to do, I have PTSD from other issues and frankly, the whole ordeal just plays in my head some nights - I hate to admit that it has become a part of me. For the record, I am seeing a new doctor now, that is not a transphobic bible-thumper. 

Is there any kind of action I can take? This bitch should NOT be dealing with any trans-people. If I was younger and less mature, I maybe even would have tried to kill myself out of being so devastated. I can only imagine what it'd do to other people."

Today I was browsing through pictures from just before I started HRT and then I took one yesterday. In yesterday's picture I've had a hair cut (about 3 inches off) as my wife was having difficulties with my longer hair. So, to keep peace at home, I got a hair cut - now she's happy and I can make just about anything work now ....
Take a look at this picture of before and after 1 year 13 months or so of hormones and let me know your thoughts .... I would hope this gives hope to those of us who thought they'd NEVER be able to pass - particularly those of us who are older - on the left I'm 66, right 67 ... I now pass daily even without trying ... the ultimate pass was yesterday at Victoria's Secret when a young clerk said, ""Ma'am, would you like to try something on?"" Me - all grins :) ~Joelle

So my father loves me very much, but is a Bible-thumping, right wing, intolerant alpha-male who I'm not sure will scold me, kick me out, or take his Remington to my skull. He doesn't even believe equality for women makes sense, let alone being trans friendly.

My mother has similar views in not tolerating LGBT+, and would probably think I'm possessed by a demon or that going to a ""liberal college"" has ""infected"" me. She would likely ban me from seeing my nephews, cousins, or anyone on her side. Not sure how my stepfather would take it either.

Sadly I'm financially dependent on them while I'm in college, so I can't simply avoid them if things go south. So I'm left with the choice of either putting college on hiatus and going back to work and living on my own, or gambling with my family, which I fear could possibly threaten my life.

So, I'm wondering whether to say ""Fuck it, let's move and tell them from a safe thousand miles away."" or ""Fuck it, let's tell them and see what happens"". I could make it on my own, I have before, but this whole thing has my stomach in a knot.

ChanelNumberOne,asktransgender,Should I ask for a higher dosage if all goes as my GP says?,"So my GP said he likes to start slow. Just 1mg estradiol and 100mg spiro. But after a month he wants to bump up, I believe he means to 2mg. Then after three months he says we might go up again.

He may bump me up higher but I'm thinking he means 2 at the end of his month. Is 1mg for one month and then 2mg for another 3 months too little to see much change?

ScrambledScreams,asktransgender,Scared of being transgender,"So, for the past few years I've known that a female label isn't for me. I never thought I fit the trans guy label however, so I instead identified as genderfluid, then genderqueer. Just recently now, I've decided to fully accept being transgender, and asked my friends and teachers to use male pronouns when referring to and about me, and I've been feeling a lot better. Since I don't have access to a binder I made one (it's safe, no worries.) And have worn it to church, in public, at my youth group, etc, and I wear traditionally masculine clothing full-time. I feel good presenting as male, even if most people don't know I'm transgender. 

But then sometimes I get this crippling fear that will quite literally hold me in place, my lungs feel compressed, I'm cold, I can't breathe, and all I can think is that I'm a fake, I'm doing this for attention, I'm making a mistake.

Say it's a normal day, and I'll be out and about my business when out of nowhere I feel like I stated above, and then I'll continue with whatever I was doing feeling guilty and ashamed, like I'm doing something wrong.

Could this be internalized transphobia? My father isn't accepting (I got told when he found out that I was identifying as genderqueer that 'you'll always be a girl, you were born one and you'll stay one.'), so I don't know if that has something to do with it.

I'm just stuck as a boy and I can't do anything about it and it makes me so mad. I look at myself and I just feel worse. The thought of going back to school as a boy is awful.

I don't want to ask them to use other pronouns and my name because I still look and sound like a boy and that doesn't feel right if I'm not actually doing anything to be feminine

I'm just trapped because my Mom won't support me through this. she says she is supportive, but she has done nothing but make me feel worse.

I don't even need hormones yet I just want to at least have girl clothes and make up and all of that. But she is so caught up in these horror stories of people regretting transition and feeling miserable and she is so determined that this will blow over that she is so scared to let me do anything regarding being trans. 

I don't even know what to do. I just want to go to school a girl and not give a fuck what people think. I just want to be happy with myself. And with my mom being so caught up in trying to keep me happy, she is doing the complete opposite. I know exactly how it would go if I talk to her again. I will gush about how awful I'm feeling and despite that she will say no and we will both get angry and she will somehow make it about her and that I'm being awful when she is being so ""supportive"" then I'll storm off because I can't take it anymore and nothing is being achieved and then 30 minutes later she will come back and be so manipulative to me and be all like ""i just care about you"" and blah blah blah so she will make me think we are actually going to get somewhere with this and rinse and repeat.

Confused574628,asktransgender,"I'm confused, help?","I have a new coworker who is transgendered.  Now I am all for being the person you were always meant to be whether or not you choose hormone replacement therapy and/or surgery.  I have met quite a few trans persons before and never encountered issues with misgendering.  Or viewing anyone as anything other than who they are.  I consider myself an ally.  But this new coworker confuses me and I was hoping someone could elaborate.  This person is AFAB and presents 100% of the time as their assigned gender be it clothing, makeup, actions etc.  However, they have requested we refer to him as a man.  Now I am aware that cross-dressing is a load of fun and I have even indulged myself on occasion.  But cross-dressing all the time would make me feel like I was in the wrong skin and I would modify how I present myself until I felt comfortable. Their significant other(a ciswoman) has never referred to him correctly always she/her.  The community is a college town and very accepting.  This person doesn't live at home.  So I am unsure as to why he always presents as a woman.  When I first met him I misgendered him and felt truly terrible when I was corrected.  I can only blame my own bias but I can't help but feel like presentation coincides with gender.  He could be a very femme straight male but is this common?  Is it okay that I'm often confused when I see him?  Is this man empowering the community?  Is it common to be trans in pronouns alone?

I'm almost certain she thinks that the only way to help deal with my dysphoria is to come out publicly and go from there, but it really isn't. My dysphoria has been getting significantly worse year after year, and it's been negatively affecting almost every aspect of my life. I need something done about it, but every time I try to bring it up to my mom, the conversation goes nowhere because she immediately reiterates the point that it's not safe in this area.

Anyone care to share thoughts/experiences?  Resources pertaining to risk or maintaining good blood health?

I started HRT at a trans clinic with a doctor but worry I haven't been proactive enough researching endocrinology and asking her for my levels..."

Violetsf,asktransgender,"Mtf, crossdresser or something else and postorgasm regret feelings","High prolactin and dopamine after orgasm gives feeling like regret to be mtf for some time. This was how it was for me before and after short time, increased libido, hormone usage.
Using estrogen would changed the way by body responds to sexual stimulation. The regret feelings after orgasm would disappear and  the desire to want to transition would always be there. 
 So could estrogen turned somebody with fetish or a crossdresser over time and after loosing the postorgasm dysphoria into a transsexual where he was perhaps not one before or could it presents the real nature?

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,"I don't know if I'm right, but I think I'm afraid to surrender to my trans feelings","Even though I've been on HRT for over a year, I've neglected to do almost anything for myself.  Part of it is that i feel a lot of wrongness and grossness for doing feminine things (thanks to being told it was bad to be girly and all), but the majority of it, i think, is that I'm afraid to let go and be myself.  

See, I'm a very uptight person.  I'm afraid to relax, to be in the moment, and overall, to feel.  Its easier for me to stay detached. I miss out on the enjoyment of life, but I avoid all the pitfalls of 'going in' for emotion.  

My honest feeling is that I want GRS.  But--I'm really worried I'm going to regret it.  Like, terrified to my core worried.  I don't have much desire at all to have the penis that i have, and to use it in any way, but there is some strange urge to use it, even though i don't align with that urge, if that makes sense? Like, when I get turned on, I feel a need to use it, but I don't really want to.  It would just be a thing to do, and it seems like the thing that my body wants me to do with it.  If i get surgery, what if i destroy some aspect of my genitals that isn't recoverable? The feeling of erection is hopefully maintanable through somone such as Suporn who leaves as much as possible, including a lot (sometimes too much) erectile tissue (free revisions for life though, yay), but still.  Something about it, even though i don't feel right having male parts at all, feels wrong to get rid of.  I don't know if its society telling me to fear being trans and me having internalized transphobia, and i want that to be it, but something doesn't feel settled.  I can't make my decision but i don't know why.  

Oddly, multiple people thought i was gay.  I think i have some inclination towards anal related things though im too scared to act on it, and thus seem gay at times, and what if that's all I need?  To be able to be myself and that maybe myself is just gay, but yet i think im trans.  Ahhhgh, I really don't know who i am.  Part of me isn't really interested in anal at all, just for personal reasons that I won't get into, but part of me feels that its my natural inclination to be sort of aroused at the thought of it.  And yes, I know girls can have anal too, but what if all i need is anal, yknow? yet im too scared of it and really dont want to, in a different but similar way to how i dont want to use my penis, but feel a drive to.  i dont know what im even saying anymore, im just spouting off my feelings and thoughts.  im absolutely terrified at the thought of getting rid of my male parts, permanently altering myself.  Its not an easy decision to make, and my brain isn't able to make any headway.  

So that's that, i dont expect anyone to have anything to say, because im totally mentally at a roadblock myself, and im the one inside my own head that knows all the things about the matter.  

anyway, thanks for readin if you did. "
shelbon22,asktransgender,How do you transition socially?,"No seriously, how?

Hormones? Check!

Completely new wardrobe? Check!

Learning new mannerisms and voice training? Check!

Like I got dis, I'm so excited to keep going with my transition and every day I'm closer to being the real me, the happier I am about it. But the thought of everyone in my personal life knowing I was born male and then one day, I'm not male anymore...like Fuck! That makes me so anxious just thinking about it.

If I could, I'd just move somewhere and meet new people never knew me before, who I will always have been female to but that's not really possible.

So how do you deal with that? How do you deal with the stress and anxiety of people knowing the ""old"" you?"
allthingzgo,asktransgender,FTM Drag Queens?,"I'm FTM and want to do drag.

Living life as a male while dressing up in drag for performance is what I want to do, but I'm worried that others might question my gender even more than they already do if I go through with it. Dressing as a woman is supposed to be the last thing I want to do, right? But wearing it as a costume and having control over it feels like it would be a totally different experience than being perceived as female while presenting male. I'm just really interested in this and want to give it a go without having to worry about other people.

FYI, I would already have been on hormones for 1+ year and had top surgery by the time I start.

How can I prepare myself for criticism? Will other trans people view me differently if I take this up for hobby? How can I avoid being viewed as a ""trans-trender"" and have my gender still taken seriously?"
GabiCap,asktransgender,When to use new name with therapist?,"Hi y'all!

So I've gone to a few therapy sessions and my therapist currently uses my guy name. Honestly, still pretty unsure of myself and who I am day to day, but honestly am trying to figure that out more than I normally allow myself to.

Yesterday at the end of our session (which was mostly about an upcoming breakup that would allow me to express and be Gabi more) she told me to let her know when I want her to switch over to Gabi.

Lately, I've been allowing myself to integrate this girl I want to be with who I am/habe forced myself to become. Though have been too distracted lately so maybe it was all a phase! And because I've been distracted and forgetting gender, I feel sometimes like I'm just fooling myself and I'm not a girl.

Anyways, breif tangent aside, how should I proceed with when to switch names with her?"
nate4ward,asktransgender,First visit to psychiatrist,"So.... I came out to my parents a couple weeks ago, and we agreed on me going to see a psychiatrist before I start anything. Originally my plan was just to go to informed consent clinic or try DIY. So i decided to go through my moms insurance since she has 3 free mental health visits through Humana EAP. They were supposed to give me a few recommendations of some people that either specialize or have a lot of experience with transgender folk. Got all the numbers called and all of them said they were not comfortable nor did they have any experience with the issue. So I got mad and ordered myself some Bovine ovary, saw palmetto, and spearmint pills for a makeshift HRT, with anti androgen and something to aromatize the testosterone to estrogen. Been taking this stuff for about a week now. Anyways my mom had a talk with these people at Humana and they apologized for half as$-ing it. They then offered to call around find someone with experience and schedule an appointment on my behalf. They did and I just saw the guy. I walked in 30 minutes early and the place was a ghost town. Guy let me in and said, ""I'll be back at our scheduled time, I'm going to read the newspaper"". Time comes around and he's back and then has me fill out the paperwork while he gets on the phone and spends 10 minutes trying to figure out what forms he has to fill out to get paid. During this time he is very vocal and loud with the insurance company (Great first impression :D). 15 minutes into our hour he brings me back to his office and we get down to business ... of me filling out more paperwork of him wanting to know how he's getting paid after the first 3 sessions (told him I switch to my dads insurance for that). We finally begin 20 minutes in :D. He asks me what brings me to him today I tell him the usual, ""I am transgender and I need to see a psychiatrist to get a recommendation for an endocrinologist to begin HRT"". He tells me he had no idea how that worked. I then proceed to tell him my story and how I feel. He then asks me, ""so you need me to talk you out of being transgender right?"" :( ....  I forget how it started exactly but he then spent the next 20 minutes telling me why my younger brother shouldn't go into psychiatry because they are underpaid and everyone is always suing you. So at the end I bring up the endocrinologist again and he says, "" yes I think you should see one."" :D ""Your hormones are probably messed up right now which is causing these strange feelings and if we fix that then you might not have these feelings anymore"". :'(  I said so what happens if the hormone levels are normal? He said then I figure out another way to fix your problem. So to make small talk while we figured out when my next appointment would be, I asked him, ""So do you have a lot of transgender clients?"" Him -"" I have had a couple gay and lesbian clients, I know that's not the same thing but its about the same"".

So clearly the guy has no idea what the hell he's talking about and either he lied about having experience or the insurance lied. Do you guys think I should:

A) Give the guy another shot and forget the fact he has no idea what he's talking about.

B) Find someone else through the sh!t referral system

C) Just go to a Informed Consent Clinic

D) Something Else"

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I've always wanted to get a ""makeover"" and I'm starting to become good friends with Girls who would PROBABLY love to do something like that. Maybe That's something to consider doing?","Okay, so really really strange question that probably doesn't make much sense. But I'm asking it anyways.

I'm starting to become friends with a couple of girls. They are really awesome people and one in particular finds me ""Cute"" like a puppy or something(I don't really get it, but whatever. I guess because I'm Shy and feminine.

But anyway, the point is, Knowing their personalities and the fact that they can tell I'm not a normal teenage boy, I'd almost be willing to bet that they'd jump at the chance to give me a makeover, You know, treat me like a doll. 

And that's something I've always wanted. I find myself wanting to wear make up, but never have. I want to so bad. And maybe this is just a cliche from movies/shows or something but girls usually like doing that kind of thing. And they're nice people that I'm getting to know more and more.

So, I'm thinking, what if I, in a very minor way, come out (something like ""I want to be a girl"" or something) and see if they'd want to give me a makeover.

It sounds stupid and ridiculous, but it'd probably be fun. I just dont know if there's a right way to go about asking something like that."

Its likely just a projection of my own internal shame and self-hatred. GID has just made me a really bitter and misanthropic person on the inside.

MyNameIsChristyX,asktransgender,I don't want to be a lesbian when I start HRT!!!,"I'm a transgender woman and I'm starting HRT soon and I know some people who get on HRT find that there sexuality changes!! I don't want this to happen to me! I don't want to be a lesbian! I don't want to fall in love with another woman! I don't want to be sexually/romantically attracted to women in any way! I want to fall in love with a man! I want a family with a man! I want to have a husband! 

The only time I'd ever probably kiss another woman is if it was for joke, or for some men or something but I would never want to do anything sexually or romantically with another woman.

I'm pre HRT and I'm attracted to men and when ever I see a handsome man I think sexual things but when I look at girls I don't ever think sexual things! I either am jealous of other girls or look at them and think there pretty, so does this make me a lesbian?

I remember when I was little I used to deliberately flirt with women because people used to think I was a gay male (I did come out as a gay male before I came out as a transgender woman) and I wanted them to think otherwise. But I can't remember if sometimes I actually found them attractive (I don't think I did but I can't remember).

I'm attracted to men who are hairy, broad shoulders, masculinity, etc. So what are the chances that I will become a lesbian when I start HRT?"
Napstablooregard,asktransgender,Looking for facts to help coming out.,"I'm in the process of figuring out how to come out, and I've been trying to do some research into the scientific aspect of transgenderism to figure out what's true and what isn't. 

From what I've found so far, there seem to be a lot of contradictory studies. Most notably from the Paul McHugh ""New Atlantis"" report that comes up as the first Google results, this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXx1DuUIhmQ), and the stories from Walt Heyer. I come from a very conservative and religious background and know that if my loved ones start to do research, that these are the things they will probably find first.

Does anyone have any legitimate, scientifically-backed confirmations of (or counterarguments against) these reports? I want to know the truth, and I'm tired of feeling like a horrible human because of these feelings that my body is wrong."
Sys32unix,asktransgender,"Not much of a question, but here's my current terrible position.","So let's get this started, I'm 13(mtf) and have been seeing a therapist(not gender therapist).

He was nice the first time, but the second time, I told him my story and he just flat out said this

""I think you are just confused on what transgender means""

My head popped at that time, I was shocked.

And then I realized that it's something I said that caused him to say this!

So ignoring everything he was saying, and just thinking, I figured it out!

Here's my story,

So I once had a fantasy, one of the ones you have while watching Harry Potter and hoping magic is real.
I wanted to be a girl, I thought life would be much better and I would be happy.

Now at the time, I had no clue what this meant.

So I left it alone, and then it happened, it was eating at me, taking my life from me.

And thanks to my teacher, who was very transportive, she was talking about teams people. 

Me being fascinated by the topic, still with no clue what transgender meant, decided to take interest into the topic.
Now in class we all kinda were laughing it all off smirking (let's call this kid John, John was a loser) ""John"" and other names.

And then my teacher said something I will never forget, something that might change my life for ever. She said ""it just means you feel as though you want or are a different gender than what you look like""

And that one quote, still swallows at my brain, eating everything I ever knew it had known.

I just had millions of memories coming through my skull, raging inside me.

I felt like s$&amp;@! I couldn't even keep my head straight!

______________________________________

However, for some stupid reason, that's not what I told my therapist.

I think it was anxiety, just floating through me.

And now I think I have to find a new therapist, because I can't just say I lied, he won't believe me!

And I can't just tell him that I don't want to come back, I just would feel bad!

And to make matters worse, I am now forced to come out to my dad(parents-divorced) because he wants to meet my therapist!"
local_clbrt,asktransgender,Gel or patches? What way is the most effective?,"Hi all!

I've been trying patches for about a week, and I have to say they are pretty convenient and easy to use - but my question is, what method is best?

I've had great results with gel so far, and I would like to keep this steady rise going. What delivery method is the most effective? Is there a big difference? How do they work delivering the estrogen into the blood, like basically which one would give me the best results?

They're still faintly there, and I do have a bit of moob (as it were), but breast growth has been the main source of anxiety, as it probably is for all trans girls. All girls in general, for that matter.

Alo-rra,asktransgender,Larger Girl looking for some wardrobe advice.,"Okay so I am a bit larger...Im 6 ft tall, have nice 50 inch shoulders, a sticky outty rib cage (which I used to enjoy before I got actual boobs!) and Im a little on the pudgy side (though I dont think this is bad in of itself).

(tight necklines/at least half sleeves and tights most days I wear skirts/shorts)

I was wondering if anyone had any wardrobe tips from experience or just as a fashion connoisseur in general

My problems tend to be either that clothes are too unfashionable either on me due to my shape, body hair (or the scabbing from shaving) or just because they are very thick and excessively conservative.

Any particularly good or bad companies to work for?,"As I near graduation, I am starting to look around at job listings to get a sense of what is out there for someone with my degree (BA in anthropology). People with anthropology degrees work in all sorts of fields, from human resources to business to writing to market research and teaching. So, the good news it that the jobs are *there*. The bad news is that I didn't realize I was trans until I was halfway through college, and now that I'm full time I'm having to consider what to do about the fact that most of my job history knew me by my deadname. 

I've heard mixed pieces of advice. Some people advocate being up front with your potential employer about being trans, while others say the best route is to hide it by either talking to your previous employers about why you've had a name/gender change, or just giving false information on your references (such as using your best friend's cell phone number as your ""bosses"" number).

I live in Washington, which is good news as far as trans rights go, but my fiance wants to go to med school and we have no idea where he'll end up as time goes on. He won't graduate his undergrad for another two years, so I have a little time where I'm going to be working while he's still in school. 

Mostly I am just looking for general information, I guess, and any stories or observations about finding work while trans. I blend well enough that in theory I could move to a new city and be totally stealth, but I know most employers do background checks these days so there's really no getting around the fact that I changed my name and gender.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Masturbation on HRT? (NSFW),"Basically zero interest in sex and masturbating, which is awesome,  but I feel like I need to keep things from atrophying. Usually looking at my penis causes anxiety. Usually touching it to pee is okay, but I could only touch it to masturbate if I focus elsewhere, otherwise anxiety. Much more so than before HRT.

Anyway, I've tried to masturbate like four times since starting HRT and only managed to finish twice, and those were within the first two weeks. Nothing since. And I had a migraine for like four days after the second time. The orgasms from those were worth the anxiety caused by masturbating, which I know is weird to say. 

So, should I buy a vibrator or something? Because I don't really care about masturbating or sex, but sometimes I do kind of want to orgasm and I don't have the energy or interest to play with myself for a long time. The prospect of having sex right now is very uncomfortable for me and sexual advances make me very uncomfortable."

(I'm AFAB NB, I've previously mostly avoided dresses unless it's laundry day or really really hot or something because they feel like giving cis people permission to misgender me.) And while we were all breaking our fast, an older lady I hadn't previously spoken to (or if I have, I don't remember) complimented me on my dress, and then went on to say something along the lines of ""I've never seen you in a dress before! Well, it's nice to know that you own one."" 

Which seems innocuous but, for me, fits a long pattern of random people praising me for things they interpret as me performing femininity, while I'm just like, it's hot out, or I didn't feel like thinking too hard about my outfit, or this was all that's clean, or I just wanted to wear a dress, I'm not suddenly trying to signal I'm ""really"" a girl. I was able to brush it off this time as ""ahaha, I'm sure she meant well and anyway my name is [unisex] now so it doesn't matter what she thinks, my NB card is untarnished"", but before the name change, it would have upset me a bit. 

So, transmasculine folks and/or trans women who don't usually wear dresses/skirts/whatever else and/or transfeminine NBs: do people say things to you implying they think you ""should"" wear more female-coded clothing/jewelry/whatever else?

proud2beT,asktransgender,How long did it take to get top surgery letter/letters?,"So I am a 27 year old FTM and have been transitioning since 2014 been on T for over a year but never went through therapy everything has be informed consent. I was just wondering how long it took most of you to get the letter for top surgery? I really want to get surgery as soon as possible as I have been a bit lazy on moving forward and now I finally feel ready for my next step :)

So do you think it is realistic for me to be able to get my letters (I need 2 for insurance) in only like 1 month or should I expect a longer wait?

Lilstephanie,asktransgender,It's Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Is A Mammogram Necessary For Trans Girls?,I was watching the local news and they mentioned a mobile mammography unit and breast cancer awareness in October.  But I'm not sure we are at risk as much as a cis girl would be.  Has anyone heard of any cases of breast cancer among Trans girls?
riahsimone,asktransgender,"No boobs: Do you wear a bra with dresses, etc?","I have no breasts to speak you yet, but I looove dresses, and wear them fairly often, but I feel like its kind of funny with out at least some sort of boobage underneath. It feels weird to wear a bra for cosmetic reasons when people know I don't have breasts. What are yall's experiences?"

OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,Doing a women's workout while being socially male...,Welp. Tomorrow is the day.  My first real diverse workout besides doing  thee treadmill/bicycle to  lose weight.

AirplaneAlice,asktransgender,Will being on a low dose for the first several months (4-7) inhibit development?,"This has been stressing me out for the past 3 months now, and it'll likely be stressing me out for the next 3. I'm not so sure my endo knows what he's doing, and I'm really worried that I won't get the 'full effects' from HRT because of it.

Will being on an inadequate dose actually inhibit any development? Or will it just make it take longer? I keep comparing to other timelines, and the expectations for onset of changes, and I'm not really seeing those things.

So when I first got on HRT 4 months ago, I was put on 1mg e two times a day (morning and night), and 100mg spiro (taken in the morning).

Before that, I had two relevant blood tests, one last october, and one right before HRT in may.

Here's the results:

    Oct Testosterone, Serum: 433 ng/dL
    Oct Estradiol: 21.2 pg/mL
    May Free Testosterone (Direct): 11.7 pg/mL
    May Estradiol: 18.4 pg/mL

After about a month of that dose (maybe 3 weeks), I got another blood test done. This test I had *after* taking my morning 1mg e pill and 100mg spiro.

    Estradiol, Serum, MS: 156 pg/mL
    Free Estradiol, Percent: 2.2%
    Free Estradiol, Serum: 3.4 pg/mL
    Free Testosterone (Direct): 5.7 pg/mL


Based on those results, he upped my e to a total of 3mg. With 2mg taken in the morning, and 1mg at night. My spiro was left the same. Three months later (just recently), I had my most recent blood test. This time I took my 2mg pill and spiro *after* the test, rather than before. That means my most recent pill would've been the 1mg e pill the previous night.

    Estradiol: 41.5 pg/mL
    Testosterone: 75 ng/dL
    Testosterone, Free: 4.55 pg/mL

Based on *that*, and asking for a dose increase, he upped my e again to 4mg. With 2mg in the morning and 2mg at night. We talked about upping my spiro, but he wants me to do a potassium test next month first (my potassium came back low).

Next blood test/visit is scheduled for January, which would put me at 7 months HRT.

So I guess here's my question. Most of the 'changes', as mentioned in the various charts and such mention starting at 3-6 months or so. However, I *still* haven't really experienced much of anything, and certainly not the changes other people are talking about for 3-5 months. And given my levels are apparently not quite in the female range, I'm wondering how fucked I am. I see many girls start to pass and get all sorts of development (and other effects like breast soreness) going on at 4-6 months or so, but I'm worried I'll miss out on that due to my low dose and poor test results.

Am I overreacting? Will I get the results I'm aiming for? Will having a fucked dose/results ruin my attempt at transitioning? Or will it simply delay things at worst? Or are my doses/levels completely fine, and I'm just being dumb?

What should I do?! I'm going a bit crazy here. Help?"

LadyByzantium,asktransgender,How do I get the courage to come out to my family?,"I apologise in advance if this isn't the how threads on Reddit usually are. I've never really used forums before but I've created an account as I feel that after lurking for a while I have found a comfortable space to talk about my feelings an get some help and support from those who really understand.

Basically I recently realised that I am transgender. Although for the majority of my life I have felt that something isn't right but puberty has made me realise who I really am.

I really want to come out to my parents as soon as possible but I don't think I can do that easily. Because my mom has always been the most supportive parent, I want to come out to here first. The problem is that I get worried very easily about the tiniest things.

Firstly, How do I build up the confidence to say ""I'm Transgender, mom""? I've tried 3 times to build up the courage but each time I panicked and given up.

Next, what do I say? Although my mother has always supported me before, I have no idea how she will react. Are there certain things I should say to make it easier for her? Are there certain things I shouldn't say?

Finally, I have no idea what to do with my Dad and my Brother. I love them and they love me but I feel they might not take it as well as my mom. They are great people but they make the occasional joke about Homosexuals which although is different, worries me a bit. Am I just paranoid?

(My brother and my father aren't bigots or anything, their sense of humour just offends me a little.)

Before I finish, can I just thank you all for existing. Before I found this subreddit I felt completely alone. In the rural corner of the Uk where I come from there aren't exactly many LGBTQ groups any where nearby. Thank you for taking to time to read a teenager's ramblings."
tr4nsthrowaway,asktransgender,i have no idea what my gender is anymore?,"i was assigned female at birth. as a kid i tended to be more on the tomboy side of things - wanted to wear boy clothes, disliked pink/makeup, begged for years to get my hair cut short etc.

when i hit puberty i became miserable. i had a curvy body and a sizeable chest and i did whatever i could to hide that. all my pictures show me hunched over and uncomfortable, and i would look especially uncomfortable in dresses and makeup.

all of this was under the surface and stuff i blamed on other things up until 2 years ago, when i got my first binder. everything sort of fell into place and things felt so *right*. i thought i finally figured out what was bothering me. i picked out a new name and used he/him pronouns, and my heart soared every time someone used them. i felt on top of the world.

fast forward to present day. i'm 6 weeks on testosterone. i feel more at peace with myself but ironically i feel less male, even though my voice is getting deeper and my body is becoming more masculine. i'm not out to my family or at work so i still get she/her pronouns used in these spaces and i've been completely desensitized to it. it's to the point where i get surprised when people use he/him pronouns for me. sometimes i'm alright with they/them pronouns too.

recently i came across someone who identified as an agender lesbian and used they/them and he/him pronouns and i was absolutely floored. i always thought he/him pronouns were strictly for men or masculine folk, but apparently there are some butch/gnc women who use he/him pronouns too??

**tl;dr went from unhappy butch girl to confused and distraught nonbinary person to happy effeminate trans man (pre-t) and now i'm on t and back to being confused but not necessarily distraught about it.**

i don't expect people to tell me ""your gender is x, obviously"" but i'm hoping people can chime in with their experiences. right now i'm using bigender as a shorthand for ""idk what the fuck is going on honestly but i have masculine and feminine feelings entirely distinct from each other but co-existing together"""
YharnamSeeker,asktransgender,Experience with doctors,"So today I told a doctor I was trans it was difficult, and it sucked. I was worried it would go how it went but to experience it really was upsetting. First he seemed to have no clue what I was talking about and was annoyed, wanted me gone as fast as possible. Kept making me repeat myself, I felt like an idiot.

Then when booking a new appointment the lady looked it over and started acting weird wouldn't look at me. Understand im still 100% biologically my biological sex right now, dress as such and everything. She kept using my name way more times than necessary to where it seems she was just trying to hammer in my gendered name over and over to embarrass me. It just felt like they didn't want me around and were getting more annoyed simply by my presence.

Now Im really worried if its the right course after all. I mean if society is this bad towards transgender I can see why its so horrible for people, you're not treat like a normal person they don't care about your feelings or anything. Im worried how the medical field will treat me going forward. Are they going to ignore me, insult me, mess up my treatment from lack of care, botch important medical stuff on purpose if they have a real hatred.

The NHS seem really awful for trans people in general, no training, no understanding, no empathy. I'd like to hear others experiences with doctors and the medical profession at large. Is it like this everywhere? or are peoples experiences different."
apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,"Initially chose one name, but now drawn to another. Am I not being serious enough about transition?","Back when I was first questioning - and even before - there was a female name that I really liked, and with time I started calling myself that name with friends online. However, lately I've discovered another feminine name that seems to suit me even better. But my friends all know me by my first feminine name. It seems a little awkward to ask them to start calling me by the new feminine name.  I'm also worried that I'll eventually get bored of this new name and want to go back to my first choice (or another name entirely).

Am I not being serious enough about picking a name and getting down to the business of transitioning?"
hayley90,asktransgender,"Is anybody else fed up of being told what they cannot have done to their own body, usually by a cis person?","I spoke to somebody today from a breast augmentation clinic, saying that I am a trans woman, planning on having BA next year and wanted to know whether this particular clinic had any requirements that must be met for a trans woman to have a BA.

The reply I got was ""you would need to have completed the national transgender reassignment programme.""  I couldn't help but laugh.

I'm from the UK and I have no idea what that even is, well I know it's not even a thing because I'd never heard of it and I googled it and, lo and behold, no results.

What does ""completed"" even mean?  Why do I have to meet some requirement set by cis people to have the breasts that I want.  A cis woman doesn't need to jump through these bullshit hoops, they just schedule a consultation and then surgery.  It makes me think that we're not really considered women, they think of us as men who want breasts to 'become' women or something like that.

They said they're going to send me some information on it tomorrow, I'll wait and see what kind of shit they have to say.

Is anybody else sick of it?  Do trans guys experience similar?

I try to avoid the whole cis vs trans thing and I don't want to tar all cis people with the same brush because I know that they don't all think the same, but seriously fuck the cis people that set the ""rules"" that trans people must play by in order to live how they need to.  The process is so demeaning.  Fucking sick of it.

BetaPop,asktransgender,Sadly a frequent poster here succumbed to suicide yesterday.,"Her name here was Viviphilia.she was brilliant.  Here is the note her brother posted to fb regarding her passing. He made it public so folks could share. So heartbreaking. 


""Regarding the passing of my beloved sister Vivien.

Some of you may have only known her as my brother Ken, and thats fine. For you, Vivien had gone through gender re-assignment over the past 4-5 years. She did this to calm a part of her mind, a part that through her life felt powerful dissonance between how her body felt and how it looked. It helped but was, tragically, too late. 

Vivien took her own life Wednesday night. We believe it was quick and painless, if that may temper your grief. My close friend had Vivien's wife alerted to the facebook post suicide note. She contacted Vivien and drove home from work immediately, and was the first responder. Regretably, Vivien's plan clearly accounted for her loving wife's interception.

My dear sister Vivien, even with her incredibly tumultuous life, still was able to look outside of herself and see the world of misery that transgender people suffer. She was a prolific and eloquent author, a leader in fact, in transgender support forums. She committed herself without reservation to proper education on the biological, psychological, and legal issues that transgender people face. She took countless people under her wing and created and maintained a healthy, accepting environment for swaths of people whom society had discarded as worthless and wrong, for reasons beyond their control. She was loved by many, and she will be missed fiercely.

I was texting with Vivien the night before her suicide, light-hearted banter about climbing (her wife and I both climb) where she suggested that I build a climbing wall on my balcony, with a bat-hang (hanging on a ledge by your feet) off the side of the balcony 160 feet up (off the 16th floor). It was fun and funny and she gave no indication of the tragedy that would soon unfold. I don't think she knew it was coming.

The next day she recieved two of the worst notifications of her life. She had been working under hostile conditions, something familiar to the trans community. She had taken initiative to launch intervention, and found out Wednesday afternoon that she would be refused legal representation. She had also requested to be transferred to an adjacent office, and that too was refused the same afternoon. From what we have put together, these events were enough to push her into a state of hopelessness and dispair deep enough for her to do the unthinkable.

Vivien was not born with a scar. She was born a perfect little baby, as we all are. Her pain came from an ignorant society in which some refused to accept how she is different. Believe me when I say that trans people are just people. They get up in the morning and go to work. They want families, and to be loved, and to be happy, just like everyone does. So if you see some stranger with clothes and an outward appearance that does not seem to conform to their apparent biological gender, please treat them as you would any other stranger. But if you see someone else harassing them, insulting, diminishing them, know that trans peoples' lives are already filled with pain and, I ask you, I implore you, I beg you to step up to defend those trans people. Life is fragile, and it is up to us to notice these threats and protect them. You now know, so it is not to be left to someone else. It is up to you.

I know that this is ""just facebook"" but I want each of you to know that I only maintain connections here with people whom I respect and care for. Every single one of you mean something to me, and have enriched my life in a positive way. Please remember this. When you are hurting and feel like the world is against you, know that, among other people, I too am on your side. 

I have been overwhelmed with grief over her passing, yet my heart is filled with a love that will never be broken. Goodbye my noble sibling, you embodied everything that we are proud of, and we will never forget you.""

QuestionThrowaway432,asktransgender,"I'm asking for help I don't mean to offend anyone. I'm currently going through a serious gender identity crisis, not taking it lightly so I've researched both positive and critical stuff about transgender and transitioning. What is the science behind being trans gendered? What are your experiences?","Long story short, born male, have been becoming more and more aware of how deeply uncomfortable I am with my body, with how the world sees and reacts to me as male, and how much my mind really goes out of its way to avoid being present in my body. Before thinking gender, I've been through years of therapists, prescription drugs for focus and depression, and lately meditation. The meditation felt like an awakening for me at first, like all of the sudden I could cope with the world, but the more I do it the more I realize it really just makes me feel detached from my body and more numb than happy. While I'm doing much better now than I was in the past, I can never seem to get any better than neutral, not bad, not good. I don't even really feel good even though I'm finally on the life path that I want to be.

One day started a trip down memory lane. I remembered all the wanting to be a girl when I was a kid. The disgust I used to feel when I looked at adult males realizing that I was one day going to look like them (which partially didn't happen as I actually ended up with very little body hair for a guy). Liking girly things as a kid and being shamed out of it. How I used to like it when adults thought I was a girl instead of a boy. How horribly bad everything got when I was going through puberty with middle school being particularly bad. etc. etc. etc. times a hundred. 

And then it hit me like a brick, Jesus Christ I'm a trans woman. It explains literally everything!

Now, I'm a grad student. As someone who was arrogant enough to go to grad school, I decided that I could be objective about this and find the truth of the matter. Particularly bothersome for me are two things. First, there are accounts of people who have gone transition and deeply, deeply regretted saying that it destroyed their bodies and their lives, some claiming that they are the typical case. Among these accounts are stories of doctors who, once transition had started, wouldn't even entertain the notion that it was the wrong choice if the patient brought it up. Second, gender critical feminists who claim that the idea of female brain and male brain are social construct, and that actually I feel the dysphoria due to purely psychological reasons I'm not aware of and that it has nothing to do with my body.

My question is thus do you have a response to the gender critical arguments? How many people here have positive experiences to the point of having gone through transition like 5 or 10 years ago and still thinking of it as being the best choice they ever made?

If transgender exists, I am sure it's what I am. Something in my mind feels like it's clicked, and my mind feels the clearest that it has felt in my life. But I want to be sure there's not some other explanation for these thoughts and feelings that I have. This is a huge thing and, if acted on, would change my life forever so I'm not taking it lightly."
rising-above-myself,asktransgender,Medication Change,"I recently started seeing a Psychiatrist for PTSD, but because she could only see me one time she said I didn't have PTSD but general anxiety disorder.   

My therapist said the Psychiatrist was wrong and it is set up for another Psychiatrist who understands gender dysphoria and PTSD and can see me more often.

My issue is this, the Psychiatrist set me up on Escitalopram and Trazandone  (i don't know my doses right now).  Since I started taking the Escitalopram and Trazandone it feels like the trans part of me is disappearing.  It is confusing for everyone .

Washcloth,asktransgender,The stress is extreme... (Rant alert),"I need some help. I'm MTF 25, and I've been ""on"" hormones for 3 years. Quotes needed because despite having a job most of this time, I've only barely been able to afford hormones. I've had many several-month long spans of not taking any hormones at all because I run out and don't have money to buy more. So I have paranoia that HRT is going to be less effective for me in the future due to how sporadic my intake is.

Things keep being thrown in my way to bar my path. I haven't gotten any help from family and friends so it's just me doing this alone. This whole time I've been DIY, and I really, REALLY want to see an endo and get actually prescribed, but I live in an area where the nearest trans-friendly endo is so far away that it becomes unfeasible to see them. I've been on and off therapists because I can't afford therapy. I make around $15 extra a week because all the rest goes toward basic living expenses. 

I recently applied for Medicaid, but while waiting for them to call or email me, I find out my phone service went out (the only thing my parents contribute is my phone service because I'm on their plan), and they said they can't do anything about it for a while. So I go check the Medicaid benefits website and I have 2 days left to turn in all my forms. And since I'm not seeing a therapist anymore due to the fact that I need this money TO see a therapist, I don't know if I have a way to prove I'm transgender.

Anyway, I'm ranting--because I'm angry and scared. What the hell am I supposed to do?"
Finding_Tara,asktransgender,Suicidal ideation and depression worse after coming out?,"Hi all. I lurk here everyday although I rarely post, sorry about that. I have recently (few months) come out to my mom and friends (dad and brothers still don't know) about being transgender (m2f). I am seeing counselling at school (university) and am also going through the process of getting hrt legally (another month at this point). 

The thing is...I want to die so badly. I am alone 99% of the time as I live in another city from my friends and family, anxious and having trouble eating and sleeping...basically functioning in general. Everyone tells me I should be happy and that my life is looking up now that I ""realized who I am"". I've never felt worse inside.

Is this something anyone else has experienced? I mean...every reaction has been positive as far as my transgender identity...but inside my head I feel awful. I'm anxious to be outside presenting male, I have really bad gender dysphoria, I'm afraid of future employment and not finding another girlfriend (3 year relationship lost when I came out) and stay cooped up inside my house all day. I pressed a knife to my neck this weekend thinking about killing myself with it and it's scaring me. I don't know what to do and am willing to take any advice if anyone has any for me.

Questioning250,asktransgender,"Quick ""Am I Trans"" post","(20 AMAB) Going to list a few major ""signs"" pointing towards/against being Trans. I understand you can't diagnose me but I'd love if you gave your (honest) opinion on what you think I am!

Here are some of my major clues for Trans:

- I've only been able to crossdress handful of times (all sexual, which has confused me)

- age 14-15, would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female 

- possibly having ""phantom breasts""


Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, at least body dysphoria i think

- enjoy lots of typical ""guy"" stuff

- not depressed/ in fact pretty happy"
krone6,asktransgender,Orchiectomy before SRS (opinions wanted),"**Update:** Sophie from the Suporn clinic replied to my email after 2 days with a huge 5,481 word email. Everything came back extremely good though Some websites I've used that review SRS doctors and their requirements aren't up to date. He doesn't require living as a female for a year, HRT, or even testicles (orchiectomy is fine). Electrolysis is also fine and recommends we don't get it to save money.

I am looking for opinions regarding orchiectomy before SRS and the pros/cons to it. Aesthetics is my biggest concern for SRS and I'd prefer to give the surgeon many years down the road the best shot I can and not make mistakes now if possible. I'll list relevant information and questions below and can give out additional info on request.

**Questions:**

**1:** Is it fine if I get a simple orchiectomy before SRS? (source: http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/La-Pa/Orchiectomy.html) 

**2:** If I do, will my scrotum atrophy at all as I am told mixed things regarding this. 

**3:** Assuming it's fine for an orchiectomy before castration is the best place down the middle front of the scrotum? 

**4:** Does it matter if a urologist in my city does this or should I see the surgeon I am more than likely going to go with for it? (already had a consult and she recommended castration, however she may have had chemical castration in mind)

**5:** Should I reverse my transcrotal at the same time as the castration surgery, as a separate ""surgery"", or leave it alone and let the SRS doctor do it? (see relevant info #2)

**6:** (very minor/curious question): I assume it's best to not get a reroute before SRS and let the SRs surgeon do that at the same time? It's probably an obvious question though I've not found answers on this yet.

**Relevant info:**

**1:** I have already reversed a PA piercing and had a plastic surgeon try twice to get the hole fully closed. He is unaware of SRS plans.

**2:** I have a transcrotal (https://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Transscrotal_Piercing) and the point of question 5 is due to hairs my electrolysis can't get to. 

**3:** Primary SRS pick is Marci Bowers, however Dr. Chet in Thailand is on my list. Both seem equally skilled though prefer Marci, however she costs three times as much as have a 4x long waiting period ($30k vs $10k, 4 years vs 1). They're both human and age, so I am taking their health into account since a crippled, old, or possibly dead surgeon doesn't inspire much confidence typically (depending on their ages since looks can be deceiving).

**4:** I will be 24 in two months. Weight is hovering around 125 pounds and am 5'10"". I'm not a ""typical"" transgender case (still getting used to calling myself transgender) and only include this info incase it helps in some way. Again additional info on request.

Thank you in advance for any help. I tried my best to focus this thread on orchiectomy though threw in some other questions that have been bugging me. Also yes, I did look around first before posting. If there are things I am doing which should be fixed tell me such as the wrong subreddit or formatting issues."

Maypell,asktransgender,How to make my mom understand why I want a binder?,"So a few days ago I asked my mom for a binder because I don't feel good with my breasts and I don't want them... So after I told her that she started asking why do I want it, isn't it for trans men(I'm not sure about my gender entirely but I know i'm not a male), if any of my friends does it, where did I come up with this and stuff like that... I tried to explain that I just don't like to look in the mirror like that and that is one of the reasons I don't sit straight but she still didn't understand and since she was in a hurry she said we'll talk about it later. 
Today she asked me why do I want a binder so I tried to explain better and that it doesn't mean I don't feel like a girl and that they are women who removed their breasts and still identifies as women so she told me she still doesn't understand and even though she is willing to buy me a binder she wants to see an article or something about women who removed their breasts because it didn't feel right to them(yeah I know there's a difference between removing breasts and binding them but i'm talking about the idea) and she also asked me if I can explain how I got those feelings (I can't really explain) and if I want to see a  therapist about it who an help me understand those feelings and if I should learn to change them or if they're ok... So if anyone can help me to know what to do or to send me a link or an article about this that would be great...

Portalboat,asktransgender,Estradiol Valerate unable to be supplied?,"I just got a call from my Walmart saying that my Estradiol Valerate shots are listed as ""Unable to be supplied"" by the manufacturer, and there was no estimated date of when they would be able to be supplied again. 

The only thing the pharmacist could suggest is trying to call Walgreens or CVS, but a year or two ago I switched *to* Walmart, *from* CVS, because CVS's supplier stopped carrying it. From the cursory bit of research I did back then - out of curiosity more than anything else - I got that Perrigo was the only manufacturer of it.

throwaphase,asktransgender,Is it too soon to determine if it's a phase or not?,"Throwaway since a few people I know know my account name.

I'll start this off by saying that I am only 14 years old. I've known that I've had some trouble with being a male for a few years now, since I was around 10 or 11, but its definitely been amped up in the last year or so because of puberty.

Now I understand that puberty does weird things to you, and I can't understand whether or not it's just a phase or if I really am transgender.  I have noticed that I am rather feminine. I love having longer hair, and that is about the only thing appearance wise that I make sure I keep. I've always found that I feel more confident when I have long hair, it makes me feel pretty, as opposed to having short hair where I just think I look gross.

I've looked naturally feminine since I was born, so I have that going for me. There have been a few instances at school where I have been mistaken for being a girl, and I've felt happy in those times, as   I feel like a person then.

I've known since around the time I learned what masturbation is that I've liked both genders, but preferred guys, so I assumed for a bit that I was just gay. That thought scared me for a while, to be honest. I've lived in a southern area that is Anti LGBT for as long as I can remember, and I would imagine what would happen if it were to come out somehow that I liked boys and enjoyed feeling like a girl. I would imagine getting beat up and teased relentlessly at school.

I'm not sure how I feel about my dad. He has said before to my siblings and I that if one or more of us were to come out as gay that he would  support us, but he has said before that I am the one  he hopes doesn't come out, since I am the only one of my dads children that is a boy, and he wants me to have kids someday.

I would say that I am transgender (or at least very comfortable with the idea of being a girl), but I don't know whether or not to think about the future as being a girl or if it's just puberty being puberty and id it's just a phase I will grow out of.

I was rambling there for a bit, so I'm gonna wrap this up with the question : Is it too early for me to be thinking about this? Should I assume it's a phase, or something I should think about seriously? Thank you. :)"

I left the whole ""call me Olivia"" thing out because talking to him now gave me the boost I needed to get through waiting to start therapy.

I transitioned a few years back (before moving here, so I've never had a local therapist), so I'm not necessarily looking for someone who specialises in trans issues or who'll write a letter quickly or even someone who sees a lot of trans people (though that's probably a good filter). I basically want your general therapist recommendations for someone who a) I won't be scared to tell I'm trans, b) won't assume that my anxiety is at all connected to my being trans and c) knows gay trans men exist.

tacomilitia,asktransgender,Today's the day,So I decided today would be the day I finally come out to my mother via text. Is there anything I should be expecting? (In terms of different reactions)
[deleted],asktransgender,I wrote this as a feeble attempt to help people understand the trans experience... hope it can help someone else do the same.,"Gender Like a Songs: An Allegorical Reflection on the Terror of Two Beats.

To my recollection, my songs begin around age four. These songs, like living cells divided with a sort of mitotic duplicity, only slightly differentiated but DNA maintained. My elementary mind was sufficiently astute to realize that some strange Incongruence between my inner experience and outer world was like a clapping to two different beats. I was evidently meant to clap to the beat my ears could physically hear and synchronize with the rhythm my eyes could see others clapping with. At some point early in life, I realized that nobody could hear my song, this other beat I heard deep within me.  This began a longing, a compulsory curiosity to tune into this song inside my soul. It seemed to tell a story and I wanted to hear it. But it became increasingly evident that only I could hear it, that for years I would secretly attempt to clap and sing along but off my lips and in my hands it failed to reflect what I knew was inside. At some point I learned to suppress this clearly wrong, perverted, and even looney song. I have always liked music, so I learned to clap on beat with this outward song, I even learned the words. I am musically inclined and can clap along with good rhythm, staying on beat so long as the volume of my inner song is sufficiently suppressed. But like the buzz of an imperfect radio signal, it quietly taunts, but I can tune it out so long as I don't allow too much quiet.

Somewhere around puberty I adopted the belief that God deplored the sinful song inside my soul. In the years since, shame, hiding, and fear of condemnation taken their toll. My lips were tightly sealed, concealing this sinister sin or at best craziness within. Failing to understand these dueling tunes has been a relentless source of distress. Though there are two songs, there is yet one master volume. To shut off the power that dysphoria and shame have over me, I find that my full pallet of emotions and also lose power. I drone on day to day numbed - a sort of collateral damage of this inner war. My deep-seated love for my wife beats strong with commitment, and intellectual love, and physical love. The same for my children. But overshadowed by the legitimate busyness of career, is a pervasive undertone of emotional detachment, distance, numbness - a sail boat with the sails tightly bound up. I am beginning to believe that I chronically overfill my plate to hide the cracks in its porcelain. My ability to find true joy in this life, joy in the simple things, the deeper things; to find amazement and satisfaction in that which is most holy and wonderfully made, my wife, and children, and God's creation - these things cannot be fully experienced by only body and mind, they require the heart. You see, I can build well, I can think strong, and do so with vigor, but my heart has been stunned into a fibrillation; a casualty of this inner war. I have come to realize that my pursuit of school and career is a mask of this inner struggle. I toil and build with tenacity, strength, and determination that so many have applauded and awed and even wondered how I do it all. I have built this house for my family, but cannot myself inhabit fully. I love vigorously with my hands and mind, but my heart remains buried and bleeding. 

I so badly want to cover up this struggle yet again... To stuff this thing back into the deepest reaches of my inner experience, to unring the bell and slip back into a skilled and perfected state of denial, numbed by busyness, building, and loving my family with ornate and grand expressions of physical and intellectual commitment. Denial is easier; I'm good at it. But with my heart hidden and emotions anesthetized, I am like a 1/3rd empty vessel. I will invariably seek to fill this void with honorable stuffings of the other two loves: strength and mind. Alas, the most vital and cherished part of being and loving, to be present as spouse, parent, and child of God is bound up and buried. The heart is the well spring of life, and I can build a fortified wall to protect it, but in doing, I and my most cherished, for whom I build, thirst."

I told my mom that I want to possibly go into sex work when I'm older and prettier. We were in the car talking about my schoolwork and future career choices. I mentioned that I might want to become a porn star and she reacted fairly negatively. She expressed concerns about me being exploited and asked what made me think this. She also demanded that I bring this up with my therapist when I see him later today.

A bit about my mother: she's fairly prudish. I'm not normally one to use that word lightly but I feel that as the mother of two teenagers she should be able to have some sort of dialogue about sex and sex work. I tried to reassure her (without going into too much detail about the state of the porn industry) that it has, from what I can gather, gotten a lot better than it was in the 1970s when she was my age.

After that we said goodbye and she left for work. What can I say/do to make her feel better? Parents in the audience, how would you feel in her situation?"

Since starting HRT (only ~3 months ago), I've definitely experienced some emotional changes. Overwhelmingly for the better, but I've also noticed myself becoming more...snippy than I've ever been? Sometimes with friends/family, but mostly at work (the only place I'm not open with anyone about my gender). A snarky comment just flies out, where before I would have held my tongue.

It's not so bad that I've ruined any relationships, as I always feel like crap afterwards and make amends somehow. Not sure if it's the mood swings, the pressure from feeling repressed, a weird self-confidence boost, or some combination of all three. I'm definitely not looking to use HRT as an excuse for my behavior - as I mentioned, I really beat myself up for it whenever it happens.

mochi49,asktransgender,My nursing textbook seems extremely problematic and reflects the general state of how healthcare workers handle trans people,"Starting out, I've had horrific experiences with health care professionals in the past. When I went in for feeling suicidal, they consistently misgendered me and even after asking for trigger warnings, where I said being misgendered would be triggering. It still wasn't enough to have countless experiences in health care where my gender would be up for question because I had an M marker in their records. At this point having my drivers license changed with my name and having an F there as well as passing has helped, but now that I'm seeing things from the other side, I'm even more wary of ever seeking medical attention outside of my primary care doctor.

In my fundamentals textbook that's around 1700 pages long, it tends to cover most things from a simple level. Obviously things like urinary health are going to get whole chapters dedicated to it, but the only mention of trans people is a quarter page long nestled in the sexuality chapter that spends most of its time on gay men.

I'm almost three months in but have little to show for it due to stubborn testosterone levels (frustrating), and had no plans on wearing women's clothes in public for at least a few months. 

So I moved in, met my awesome new roommate, and suggested that we go out to dinner. While I was getting ready, though, the thought of wearing guy clothes to dinner just felt like too much work. It sort of felt like, ""Ugh, this mask is heavy. Whatever, a few weird looks is easier.""

After many months of dreading the moment I would go out in dress for the first time, I thought that it would take courage and determination to finally take that step. Instead, it was just...laziness. Since then I've completely abandoned guymode, and it's a lot easier even considering the fact that I have yet to get gendered correctly by a stranger once.

I like my lower voice, my face is starting to change, I'm becoming more muscular...but today I woke up and was like...am I a woman? I don't feel like a man. I don't feel like a woman. I identify more strongly with women emotionally than I do with men, but maybe that's because of gender roles that are imposed on society and because I grew up believing I was also a woman. I know that I want a more masculine body but I've recently been feeling weird about people eventually identifying me as a cis male. I still want to be visibly queer and I am right now, but further on in my transition it won't be as easy...

There's a person I really admire. She identifies very strongly as a butch lesbian woman, but is very masculine looking, and is often mistaken for male. Her face and body are quite masculine. And I find myself wondering, if I looked like her, would I be more comfortable with myself, and not feel like I need to be on hormones?

No matter what, I want top surgery. That's how I came to realize I was trans, after finding out top surgery is a thing. And I want to look masculine. And I feel much better on testosterone. The ever-present discomfort I had existing in my body has lessened considerably. 

I like being called ""he"", and I don't like being seen as female by others only because I know it's because my body still has feminine curves. I can make my body look more masculine with certain clothes, but I don't feel comfortable in a female body without the disguise of clothes. But I'm worried still, after going on T, that it's just because I hate my body. 

I worry in a year or two I'll regret this, even though right now I can't imagine going off T because I don't want my period to come back and I don't want to continue aging and looking more and more female as life goes on. 

I guess I could just call myself nonbinary or genderqueer and call it a day, but I always go back to wondering why I'm not satisfied just wearing men's clothes and having a short haircut and being seen as a butch woman. Because I wouldn't mind that, except for my discomfort with my body. If I could have a male body and still be seen as female, I feel like that would be ideal?

Ugh. I just want to figure myself out so I can stop thinking about my gender and get on with my life. I'm worried I just went on T because I just hate myself so much I needed a change, but I also don't quite feel like that was it...looking in the mirror and seeing a female body made me feel so uncomfortable. But if I had just been born as a more masculine-looking woman, would I have been happier? I don't know? I know I still wouldn't want hips and breasts, but there are some women who have very little of both? 

Anyone relate? I know there are people that do, because I've posted a lot about this beforehand. It's just that sometimes I feel more strongly masculine, but then other days I'm like...what am I doing?"
someguynamedcole,asktransgender,"My name change was approved but doesn't go into effect until December, can I still change it at work?","My name change was approved today (yay!) but in NJ you have to wait a couple of months between when the judge approves it and when you can start changing your documents. So technically my new name goes into effect on December 12. The head of my department said he would see if HR will permit my email display name to be changed since I at least have the signed and stamped ""Final Judgement"" indicating that my name is allowed to be changed. 

However, what should I do if I'm not permitted to change my email display name until December 12? I still present as female at work and dysphoria only gets worse and worse. That leaves my only other options as presenting as male with a female email name (I work in tech support for a school district so I regularly interact with people from dozens and dozens of schools, and my email name and name in our ticketing system identify me, which means misgendering and deadnaming galore) or trying to get medical leave until December 12 (The head of our department complains that we're shorthanded). Either way, I can't see myself presenting as female for almost two more months. 

Would I have a legal case in this situation if HR doesn't permit my email display name to be changed?"
amon_erin,asktransgender,I'm tired of worrying,"Tomorrow will be 3 weeks on HRT. I don't want to go back. In fact, there are times I'd rather die than go back. Thinking about going back makes me pretty upset.

And then there are times I worry I don't want this and that I'm lying to myself, but I don't think I am. I mean, when I got my first set of labs back today from two weeks on HRT, I was expecting to see relatively high T levels still and relatively low E levels still. But I was excited to find the opposite. My T is down to about 40ng/dL from around 700 and my E is up to 70 from around 35. I was excited! 

But then there's this fogginess and relatively persistent, but low grade headache. This is what really has me worried. I DO NOT want to have to stay as a male. In fact, were it not for my current very male looking appearance and terrible voice, I'd love to go full time. So, I guess what I'm asking is if this should be cause for concern?

Granted I feel like I've been coming down with a sinus infection or something for the past couple of days, but the fogginess and headache were there before.

Thoughts?"
GenHmm,asktransgender,Have I been experiencing dysphoria?,"Hello everyone and thanks in advance for reading this. I've had a weird week, in that I think I might be just discovering that I'm trans, and I think I've experienced mild dysphoria. I'm not sure if they qualify as mild dysphoria, so I'm listing them here. Would appreciate any
insight, thank you!

1.) Feeling disconnected and uncomfortable in my body, in maneuvering my body, and in expressing myself physically. I've always sort of subconsciously held myself stiff, measured my movements, and felt uncomfortable every letting go.

2.) Feeling disconnected emotionally, and experiencing my emotions at a distance. I've never been uncomfortable with emotions, or shied away from them, but still feel detached and numb to them to a certain degree.  Like they are somewhere else and if I want to see them, I have to view them through a window.

3.) Never feeling like 'one of the guys.' I was never uncomfortable around guy friends, just never felt like one of the guys. I just felt different. It wasn't, I don't think, because I was overly timid or generally uncomfortable in my own skin. I just didn't feel like one of the guys, and I didn't understand what created that feeling. There was just an inability to fully relate.

4.) Having no desire to dress nicely, take of my body (besides being healthy), and not feeling like there are any examples that I can identify with. Not knowing how to express myself or create a presentation that represents myself.

5.) Having no real connection or feelings related to manhood or masculinity. I identify with the power and success exemplified by women much more.

On a more positive note, something I've felt the last few days:

6.) Feeling a surge of positive emotions at the thought of being addressed with the female pronoun.

7.) Feeling so jealous of women I see who are dressed well  and are dressed nicely.

8.) Vague feelings that make me feel more feminine and expressing myself femininely relieve the issues I've listed above.

9.) Expressing myself and thinking of myself as a female, makes me feel much better and relieves some of the issues that I've had before

Thanks for reading! One of the things that makes me feel like it isn't dysphoria, and that I can't be trans, is that I don't feel like a woman unless I consciously make myself feel that way. Otherwise I'm not feminine. Becoming more feminine, though, maybe just by walking, has made me feel better though."
arthur990807,asktransgender,"""They"", yet ""Mr.""?","Hi. So I'm nonbinary, as my flair suggests, and my pronoun is ""They"". My given name, however, is markedly masculine. It doesn't cause me any dysphoria, but I _am_ a bit anxious about the fact that I want to be referred to as ""Mr Lastname"" rather than ""Mx Lastname"". It's the option I'm the most comfortable with, and yet it seems awfully inconsistent to me. Shouldn't I be fine with being he'd if I'm fine with being Mr'd? ;~;

I've heard the ""whatever makes you comfortable is okay"" line, by the way. I can't say it's a convincing argument for me.

If someone could help me out here, that would be great. Thank you in advance."
give_me_bewbz,asktransgender,Choosing between family and transition,"My parents recently forced me into seeing a handpicked psychiatrist, and last night I got a copy of the letter he wrote to my GP. He wrote how I have gender dysphoria, but a lot of anxiety - exacerbated by my parents' reactions. He recommended some antihistamines + counselling.

My mum asked about the letter, and in our conversation I mentioned my endo had called me about sperm storage.

She blew up again.
Apparently I promised not to change myself, I'm harming my two younger brothers, I'm disturbed, and I lied to all my doctors. 
Our conversation ended with her saying she could no longer tolerate me.

I am 23, live 150 miles away from them, and yet this hurts so much. I was blackmailed into seeing that psychiatrist against my will under threat of disownment. I answered honestly, and ended up with an accurate assessment, and now they're convinced I was lying to him. I gave them resources to read, help lines, support groups, and counsellors' numbers. They refuse to read any of it.

I'm forbidden from talking to my brothers, and I will respect their wishes regarding my youngest brother, who is under 18. 

I've felt so conflicted, and it seems that if I continue, and find a way to be happy in my body and life, that it will be a life without those I care about the most. I genuinely don't know if I can do that - I'm alone out here. For so long my only emotional support was my (ex) girlfriend, and my parents. My ex is gone, and my parents refuse to do so much as entertain the notion maybe I'm sane - to them I seem to be some manipulative deluded maniac.

I text my friends across the world, and the past 2 months circumstances have conspired to keep me from going to any local LGBT / trans groups. I'm hoping to get out soon, but I just need advice on what to do, to hear that others have faced the same problems and come out the other side.

What can I do?"
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Very suicidal thoughts,"I am 15 and I think I am about to kill myself. Puberty has almost finished everything except for the beard and I think I am too masculine to ever pass as a girl.


I am bigger and broader than 99% of all women (normal weight) in my area. I was not born a girl which hurts me alot but the that I will never be anything near as feminine as a cis girl ruins everything. I am very skinny and have no muscles since I don't do any sports or anything like that, so I don't think I can expect almost no reduction in broadness especially in the shoulder and chest area. I've noticed that the bone structure and form for example the chest is usually smaller than that of a mans.
 

Nobody believes me that this a real problem for me or even don't believe that I am trans. Therapists seem to be out of ideas to help me and are even threating me to force me to take T. I really don't want to live this life, I can't do anything about my problems."
Cuteness_Everdeen,asktransgender,[MTF] Dysphoria worse after HRT?,"So, my wife's recently really struggling with her dysphoria. It seems the more she passes, the more her genitals bother her. Prior, she just wanted to pass socially and was... tolerant of her anatomy. 

[Fyi for this next part: We've always had an open relationship]

Recently she crushed HARD on a new [cismale] friend who doesn't return her feelings and [respectively] rejected her interests [somewhat possibly because of her genital status].

So this is new territory. She is pretty miserable and I want to be there as much as I can. I also understand I don't want to in anyway invalidate or minimize her feelings. I know there is no cure for her dysphoria and I don't expect to fix it.

R/asktransgender,  do you have any tips or suggestions for me to tend to her? I'd be most grateful. She does have therapy Tuesday."
Rfbmin,asktransgender,My best friend (intersex/trans) and I are getting very close. Need advice.,"I'm a cis guy. My best friend is intersex, with CAIS. So he's biologically XY but due to androgen insensitivity, his outward appearance is fully female. He was raised as a girl and his condition was only known at 12. We've been best friends since about that time.

In later teen years he told me of his desire to transition to live as male. It's extremely difficult with people with CAIS to transition due to the body's insensitivity to androgens like testosterone so any focus is just on appearance. He plans to do top surgery to remove his breasts and do liposuction on his butts but he can't afford it right now (we're both 22). So right now he still lives in female-mode publicly, although with a very boy-ish style.

So since a few months ago I've been having these feelings about him. Like every time our bodies touch or something I get those weird feelings. I never gave them much thought and tried to bury them away. I always thought he is in a very vulnerable state and I'm the only friend who understands his condition and challenges fully and he needs me to be his best friend like I've always been. I do have feelings for him but loving him means I need to be what he wants/needs me to be, rather than me wanting him to be what I want him to be. However in the past month or so I feel like he's been giving me signs that he's open to us being more than best friends but he's also nervous about it. Or maybe I'm misreading the signs. That's why I need help.

I think he's becoming a lot more touchy and physically affectionate which is a little weird as he's never been like that. He's always been insecure about his body and was never a fan of excessive touching. We used to talk a lot about it. He always told me that he hated it when anyone hugged him. But now he's hugging me a lot lately. He never did that. He also says things that make me wonder. Like just last night he was telling me how much he loves me and I told him that I love him too and I felt like something else is also coming but he didn't say anything and neither did I. Once a few weeks ago he told me how things could have been different between us, and I was dumb as I asked something like ""how? Like we wouldn't be friends at all"" and he just said ""you're so stupid"" jokingly and left it there. Going back, I feel like he's trying to say something.

First, am I just projecting my own feelings here or is there something? And second, how to move forward?

Lorie_love,asktransgender,"To MTFs here (incl. me), to what extent clothes and the way you dress and present to others account for your TGness ?","(Question includes ftm as well. Sorry for those offended !!)

Female clothing is driving me mad."
TotallyAPortion,asktransgender,Watched an adult video online. Felt disgusted. What is happening?,"So background:

• Late 20s MtF

• Tomboy

• Half a year-ish on HRT

• Used to identify as man who secretly wished to be woman

• Now identify as woman who's actually been stuck inside man's body the while time.

Okay so now the relevant part. 

Before I started transitioning I used to be incredibly in to pornography. I would watch at least once daily, sometimes up to 4 or 5 different times in 1 day, always ""finishing"" each time I started. Even if I got interrupted I would almost never get caught afaik and I would stealthily resume and finish.

I used to be into all kinds of stuff. Interracial, big D, lesbian, music video... um... Really hate myself for this one... ""rape fantasy"", humiliation, public, all kinds of stuff...

Well today, I was feeling a bit kinky so I went to a site, and clicked the first of maybe 4 or 5 thumbnails I looked at (I used to be alot more picky when it came to the thumbnails).

Looking back that was the first thing that was different. 

Anyways, so the first thing I noticed was the description of the video, it was like something about family or forbidden or whatever. So i immediately knew it was gonna be like an incest plot. 

I used to be all about that kind of shit, but this time I was just ""meh"", because I just wanted to watch 2 people enjoy eachother and the premise is now making that... weird... I guess, like right off the bat though. Any contact is now immediately ""weird contact"", and it just wasn't the same.

Anyways, I decided to give it another chance, so now this petite, young girl comes in and is talking to this guy who looks like... he works as a plumber? Or a fucking... security guard? Or something. Kind of pudgy, tall maybe like 6 feet or something, a little unkempt, but the look on his face.

He looked like a big dumb neanderthall, basically.

So this tiny little girl comes in and starts talking about oh she wants money for a purse but she's too poor and big brother (the plumber/security guard) has money so clearly we know where this is headed.

They start negotiating.

Like he's haggling her about what kinds of sexual acts will financially equate to the money he needs to buy the purse. 

What. The. Fuck? 

This girl bless her heart looked like she was **really** not into it but was just reading the lines they gave her because they were paying her.

So I guess there's a weird irony in that (because she was in a porn video which means she probably got paid), but it was still clear that she was less than pleased with this guy, but pretending to not be. Or maybe she was just a good actress...

Anyways. They agree that monthly sex + small monthly payment = total cost of purse, and he starts undressing her, but here's where it got really weird.

He asks her if he can ""lick her"" and says he's been wanting to for a long time...

She asks him how long, and he says ""probably since right before you went through puberty."" ...

Like, WTF? Yet again.

She says ""That's kind of gross dude."", which btw couldn't possibly have sounded less scripted imho. He responded by saying he doesnt dont care.

Then he starts licking her and she's sitting there squirming looking secretly mortified to be doing sexual stuff with this pedophile/rapist of a man, and she starts talking to him about what if people find out.

Every time she says something he briefly stops to respond and then quickly goes right back to tonguing her.

For example:

Her: ""What if dad walks in?""

Him: \*Briefly lifts head without even moving his face or eyes away from her vagina\* ""He's out of town."" \*Lowers head\*

Her: ""What if I need to talk to someone about this?""

Him: \*Briefly lifts head in the same lazy impersonal fashion\* ""*Yeah except you're my sister*, so you won't."" \*Lowers head\*

This guy just totally squicked me out. He seemed like the type of person who had very little understanding of the emotion of empathy, and any time he gets aroused he decides what he wants and that's it and other people's concerns are not really relevant. 

He struck me as the type of person who is intellectually and emotionally lazy, and who would ostracize and potentially even physically assault... someone like me... if he knew the truth about how I felt.

It's people like him that terrify me when it comes to going ""full time"".

Why did I never feel this way before? Was I just like this guy? 

Has anyone else here experienced this?"
PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,For FtMs who are early in HRT: What next change are you most eager for?,"As a mtf who is early in my hormones (1 month), I just cannot wait for my chest to start tingling and eventually feel sore, meaning my breasts are growing!

Seeing as how I never researched having a 2nd puberty the other way, I don't know in which order a male would expect his body to masculinize. If you're as early as I am on HRT, what big gender-affirming change are you looking forward to next?"
LtSikorski,asktransgender,Is it ever too late for hormones?,"I know this question probably gets asked quite a lot so sorry for adding to it. I got an appointment for an introductory group in under 18 services in the UK (Tavistock GIC) for information before transferring to adult services but I'm not sure if I managed to confirm it in time. If I didn't, I could just ask my GP to refer me to adult services so I can skip this under 18 introductory group but I don't know if I would've got an adult appointment quicker if I had gone to this group. I am seriously hoping that it's not too late because it's making me feel really down thinking about the possibility.

Anyway, in the worst case scenario, I miss the group and so that means it'll take longer to get an adult services appointment. In that case, how late is too late for hormones? Are there any irreversible physical changes after a certain age? I still have to go through all the assessing and everything else before I can even actually start hormones so even once I get my first adult services appointment, that's still not the final end of it all."

Jassy2cute,asktransgender,Best Friends Mother doesn't want me as a girl in her house.,"Hey guys, so I'm a transgender girl and my bestfriend is female (cis). We meet 2 years ago and become really good friends when I presented as male and orientation was gay. Her mother loved me, always being so nice and heartwarming. In some ways she could be like a second mother I suppose. However, I recently started going to her house as a girl. Her brother apparently saw me, he's older by 2 years (24), and of course didn't know who I was. This happened multiple times and he finally expressed his feelings to his and my best friend's mother. This is where things go downhill.

The mother went to talk to my best friend. My best friend's mother is religious but didn't have an issue with me being gay (maybe hoping I become straight for my best friend?) but being transgender is where she draws the line I guess.  She told my best friend that I have a ""spirit"" inside of me controlling me and if she stay around me long enough my ""spirit"" would start to make my best friend transgender as well. She also said I was not allowed in the house as *NewName* but as *Deadname*. Of course my best friend got into a huge argument with her mother using female pronouns to get her point across and make it known that she will bring me over as a girl.

She told me this on Monday night (10/17/2016) but didn't want to because it makes her upset. I told her that as a transgirl, I am to expect this in life and my skin will only get thicker from it. I respect her mother, her mother's religious views, and her home. I told my friend for the time being, since I'm only one month on Hormones and living part-time I'll come over as a male and maybe figure something out later to avoid her and her mother arguing over my life. 

Has anyone else had experiences like this? If so how did you and those involved come to terms?"
hatesherself,asktransgender,im an awful person and i feel helpless...advice?,"hi. ive no idea if this is actually trans related but i have no idea where else to type this. 
im just looking for help/advice. i'm 26 years old, mtf, started taking t-blockers etc at the age of 17/18ish. i live on my own since my mom passed away when i was 17. i dont have friends, i dont have family, i usually just play games all day since i just recently got the message that i didnt get a spot at university for this semester so dont really know what to do with my life while all my job applications and other things are still pending. also its the best way for me to escape reality and just distract myself, it has always been my escape.

i like playing games/music/reading books/writing/cooking and to some extent art. ok, that was just a bit about me. 

i used to have a boyfriend, lets call him J. J and i were together for ~4 years. it wasnt that exploding love feeling you might expect but..it was something at least for the first ~2,5 years or so. we never really had fights or problems with each other (actually never..now that i think about it). it was all good during that time. something happened (to this day i still dont know what) and he changed 100% towards everyone including me. after a while i just couldnt handle it anymore and broke up with him. continued to stay friends and after a while (maybe 2 months?) he told me he is really sick and hes going to die and he knew the whole time but didnt want to tell me and thats why he was so shitty towards me and everyone else. i instantly felt regret and like shit. he lived like 3h away so i had no idea of knowing. i felt bad and guilty so i just stayed around and kind of got back together or something similar, i just wanted to have him a good last time. another few months pass and i get a really odd msg from a friend of his ive known for ~2 years at this point aswell. he sent me some screenshots, pictures, videos and a msg telling me that all of it was made up, he wasnt sick, he wasnt feeling bad. he goes out all the time, fucking literally everything he can and then comes online and pretends towards me hes sick. i freaked out, confronted my ""boyfriend"" and he admited every little fucked up thing and told me its my fault for being who i am. worthless transgender freak etc and i should be happy he at least hang out with me because no other guy would ever like or want me because of what i am etc. i blocked him everywhere and just tried to move on somehow. 


a few really really shit and dark months followed and that probably fucked me up for the rest of my life. i used to be a nice person, semi-happy considering everything, i was able to trust people, i never expected people to have bad intentions with me. but after this all of it changed to the opposite. 

after many months have passed..between studying parttime and doing nothing but playing games the other time...i met another guy, online. lets call him D. how we ""met"" was pretty random. we ended up in the same group of players for ranked games due to a person we both know. we ended up playing and i quickly noticed that hes actually highly skilled....and i even more noticed that whenever he opened his mouth on TS i wished he wouldnt stop talking because he had the - in my opinion - most attractive voice ive ever heard. few games pass, he sends me a friend request..i thought for a second and just accepted (i have to say i never ever accepted friend requests of random people before because..well i used to be pretty arrogant ingame and i thought of most people to be bad and didnt want them to bother me..but his voice and considering how well he played i just accepted). we ended up chatting, playing a lot more together. ended up being kind of a duo that would only join groups together and do everything with each other. few months go on like that and i realized i actually somehow got a real crush on him. was too shy to say anything but he eventually told me how he felt about me (the same i felt about him). we eventually ended up having 18h+ skype calls every day...then he asked me for a picture and i did the biggest mistake ive ever done in my life so far. while i went to take a picture of myself and looking at it i got triggered and everything my ex said to me, about what i am, my looks, how ugly i am, no guy would ever want something like me, everything came back and i..sent something fake. completely irrational and out of my mind. it took like a day for me to realize wtf i did and i didnt know a way out of it that wouldnt mess up everything even more - i was really just fully out of my mind and not able to think rational. time went on and i just continued the shitty thing i did which just snowballed into more problems .. mixed some pictures of myself without face in there here and there but felt guilty and awful beyond anything. it made me turn into a really negative and shit person because i knew i messed up, a lot. i knew all of it was fake due to what i did and nothing of it would ever work out so i just started being a salty negative bitch all the time until he broke up because of it and just wanted to be friends. we stayed friends for like..idk, close to a year maybe. while i still loved him and i think he still loved the person he thought i was aswell (At least he said that twice during that year). i started going to therapy and just tried to get to be normal again or at least a shadow of the person i used to be and not this negative messed up wrack i turned into after my first relationship. after like 3 months of therapy and not talking to him i felt ready to contact him again and tell him the truth and everything. he obviously didnt react well..


im just mindboggled by my own brain how i could do something like i did towards someone else especially after what my first boyfriend did to me, i legitimately despise myself. therapist keeps saying i have to forgive myself and i just wasnt ready back then yet and was still struggling with what happened. but i fucking cant. what kind of lame shit excuse is that. if i wasnt ready back then i shouldve said it like that instead of doing what i did.  i mean i told him i wasnt ready for something new but at the end i went for it regardless. 


nowadays all he sees in me is some above average skilled player to play with if he doesnt have anyone else, he doesnt care about me or anything anymore. i still like him, a lot, pretty sure i still love him actually. with him i had the only fun time ive ever had, looking forward to every new day i could spend and doing stuff with him. seeing how he goes out to date and f*** around with other girls makes me feel like throwing up or something inside me gets ripped apart. he just did it yesterday, again. 


i just want this misery to end and decided it would be a smart idea to make an account on some onenightstand dating whatever-you-want-to-call-it site. openly stated im trans (no srs yet so would be hard to hide...). got a surprising amount of msgs (all chasers anyway...). decided on the one who seemed the most normal and just....am supposed to meet him in like 4 hours. im so freaked out ive never done anything like this and was never interested in it either. but i feel like if i ever want to be happy again i need to get away from my 2nd ex who i still love but makes me feel nothing but guilty and bad (deservedly so i guess..). im actually a bit terrified..i dont even know if i want this. i just want this whole situation to end or change

so idk what to do anymore now. im just an awful person trying to get her shit together and not be this shit person anymore. in those 26 years ive been wandering around on this earth just trying to figure shit out i dont think i have ever felt as bad as i feel now. until a week or two ago i kept telling myself ""tomorrow will be better"" ""everything will be ok it always turned out to be ok in the end"" ""small steps, everythings gonna be alright"" but not anymore. every day gets worse, every day gets more depressing and lonely and more full of selfhate. holy shit this ended up being long..

Bronzefrog,asktransgender,"Question about the recent study published in the Lancet: ""Removing transgender identity from the classification of mental disorders: a Mexican field study for ICD-11""","I found this recent and interesting study published in the lancet: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(16)30165-1/abstract

The study argues that transgender identity shouldn't be classified as ""mental illness"" because the distress and dysfunction were mostly due to social rejection rather than being transgender per se.

However, I wonder what the study say about gender dysphoria. Does the study indirectly say that gender dysphoria doesn't exist (the distress being connected to social rejection) or do they distinguish ""transgender identity"" from ""gender dysphoria"" (like what the DSM do) and say that dysphoria can cause distress?"

Blairnatalie,asktransgender,is this weight distribution/muscle atrophy?,"Good morning reddit,

Before we start, if any of yall follow my posts you'll know I'm 5.5 months hrt, and on a dosage of 6mg E, 150 mg Spiro daily. I have not seen my levels for 2 months (visiting doctor 1 week from now) However last time my levels were around E 230 pg/ml, and T 4 pg/ml. That was on 4mg E, and 150 mg Spiro, I have a higher dose now so I imagine that's changed. I believe those are the right measurements btw.

Anyways,

 I'm constantly feeling growing pains in my lower legs/calves, and the hips area. For instance these past two days my calves have had a growing pain type feeling to it, same with my hips, it definantly feels like somthing is going on lol. It doesn't effect day to day life but the feeling is there none the less. Does anyone else feel these too? I guess it would be weight distribution taking place, or atrophy of certain muscles?

DA_FENCE,asktransgender,Getting Off the Fence- Doubts About Moving Forward.,"Hi everyone. Not only is this is my first post,  its my first time ever being able to admit this to anyone other than myself-but enough 's enough, time to get off the fence about possibly transitioning so I can move forward one way or the other.  I hit 30 this year, and I often read that a lot of people's only regret is that they didn't start sooner- in a way I'm in the same boat. There's a part of me that wishes I would have done something sooner so I could have had my 20s and I lost it, on the other hand, I'm fortunate-I've had a good life- and the time lost has probably afforded me the freedom and financial opportunity to pursue action now that I otherwise wouldn't have had. But I don't want to be in my 40's regretting losing another 10 years. So here's some background-

Overall, I don't have a lot of doubt about my feelings- they've been around since pretty early childhood. I knew then I would have rather been a girl, and it never really went away. Yet I always felt the need to hide it (beyond telling my parents I wanted to be a girl dressed up in some things from my sisters costume bin at around 5 or 6), their reaction wasn't particularly negative, so I'm not sure what the deal was/is. But I got older, and a traditional gender roles developed and a get with the program mentality along with it- I still had these thoughts, and ""playing"" dress up still happened every chance I got.  So throughout my teens, I figured I was a cross dresser- I didn't have a sense as to what transgender was, or anything other than what I assumed was a quirk that would probably not fly too well if people found out, and I got very good at covering my tracks, and very afraid of getting caught. Around this time, I was pretty uncomfortable in my body, and I assumed at the time it was because I saw myself as overweight, which remained after I hit puberty and slimmed out- I realize now that this could have been dysphoria, I developed a habit of looking in mirrors out of the corner of my eye to watch myself so that no one could see through me, I always- through the present hated and avoided getting my picture taken, thinking to myself ""I don't want to be remembered this way"". 

In the past (and present), a lot of my long term relationships were effected, because in the end, I was waiting to outgrow or overcome these feelings- and I always kept a measure of distance because of it, and while I've always been attracted to and cared about the women I've dated, I've never really cared about or been driven about sex, because there's always been a sense of off-ness afterward.

In college, I discovered what transgender was, and began to question if this was a possibility for me- a lot of the signs were there, and a lot of the ""am I trans"" questions I've read on the internet come up affirmative, but still I was living a male life with a girlfriend, friends, and family that would be blindsided by a side of me that I had gone through painstaking efforts to keep secret. After-all- if I just waited it out, it'll go away- right? Sometimes, yeah it did- I got busy, couldn't dress or purged. Relief came in the form of not getting caught, but the feelings were still there, and they always came back stronger.

Onward to the future, my moment of truth came when at long last, I was able to go all out for the first time (otherwise it had been piecemeal items or limited, but now I had my own place, wig, makeup, clothes, the works), and I took a picture of myself and my smile looked real and sincere for what was the first time in a long time (unlike every awkward forced smile in every other picture I couldn't avoid), and I knew the woman I was looking at was the real me- I was comfortable and at peace- and I knew right then, this was probably more then cross dressing. 

More recently, I've found myself asking- ""well why not do something about it?"", and the debate in my mind begins- and here is a brief summary of those reasons why not:
1.) To be as real as possible, its scary- this is a door that once I open, there's no closing, and I can't control the spread of information after I open up to another person about this if I change my mind about being open. I worked a long time to keep this hidden, and the stress of keeping it secret probably isn't worth it- and there's probably still no reason to. Still- its a big deal to me, and well if I don't get off the fence after telling someone- 30 years of secrecy and anxiety down the drain for nothing :P

2.) I've had a good life, I'm grateful for the family, friends, and career I've started- while I'd like to hope that I might be able to keep things things, I have to tell myself that I should be prepared to lose them. While my parents are catholic, they're good people, and I legitimately believe while they might not approve they would probably still be in my life (with a heavy dose of classic guilt and prayer). Still, they're great people- they've never given me a reason not to love or trust them, in a way I'd be willing to sacrifice my happiness for theirs (to add food for thought, I am the only ""male"" with the family last name- no pressure right?).  Otherwise, aside from family I'm very lucky and grateful for what I have in life and in a way it seems wrong to me to put that in jeopardy. I've gotten very good (and increasingly so) over at the last couple years at being ""one of the guys"", I've notice a definite difference since I've amped it up, to a point that life almost seems better despite it being an act. At the end of the day, I have a warm bed at night, food in my stomach, and people who love me- how important is being happy as a gender compared to being happy as person? Is this something I can't actualize the importance of because I've never had both?

3.) Anxiety- One of the major barriers. Since my teen years, I developed pretty bad anxiety. Reflecting, I feel that this quite possibility could have been the result of being trans and hiding this, but on the other hand maybe the anxiety is the result of a chemical imbalance in my brain, but if transitioning could cure this- this would probably be end of discussion. I avoid a lot of people and experiences- as is- because if it. I'm afraid that pursuing a transition would make my anxiety worse- in a way, I would almost prefer living behind a mask if it meant I could experience life without it. I plan on making an appointment with a therapist in the very near future- the question is, do I chose a therapist that deals with gender issues, or a more general one? If anyone has experience with this one, I would love to get your perspective.

4.) My girlfriend- Once again, I've found myself in a long term relationship while trying to be an average, ordinary ""with the program"" person- hoping for this to leave, but again enough is enough, I am so tired of waiting and hiding this. I love her, and I'd want a future with her- but I've lied to her through omission and for a long time (3 years). More-so, I'd like to start a future with her, if possible. I've wanted to tell her for awhile- but either the opportunity or chance has just never come up. I've tried to drop hints or test the water, I honestly have no idea if they've landed, in a way I wish I'd hinted enough that I could just get asked point blank, but no dice- she's generally supportive and attends pride rally's as an ally, but I'm prepared either way, she deserves to know and I can be understanding if its not what she signed up for.

So that takes us to the present. My current plan is as follows- any advice or your experiences would be appreciated. We're currently going on vacation next week, afterwards (maybe the weekend after we get back) I plan on telling her more or less what I've summarized here- that I've been questioning for awhile, and I think I might be trans- I'm interested in exploring this feeling through therapy, and the possibility of transitioning existing and getting on HRT asap or at a minimum pursuing it at home on a more regular basis as some form of relief while not rocking the otherwise good life boat and presenting male publicly. If she ends up being able to accept this (given some time), I plan on asking her to move in with me, and probably would propose not too long after. I also plan on doing this in person. Does this sound reasonable? Any advice on approaching this? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

Anyway I would be grateful to hear anyone's experiences, and even criticisms (for example if someone could let me know in fact this is a phase, or just cross dressing 2.0 that would be great so I don't have to uproot my life and stuff, but for now I'm fairly confident its therapy time) or if you have any questions. Thanks, and this is my first outreach into the community- so hi!

TLDR; Very closeted, time if fleeting, questioning if transitioning is worth it in an otherwise decent life.

AtAurora,asktransgender,My dysphoria is getting worse. How do any of you deal with it?,"Sometimes at random moments, I  suddenly start to over thinking on how I look and how I want to look. I keep thinking about how I should look more feminine and that my current appearance is wrong. I find that these waves of dysphoria are usually caused whenever I wear my more masculine clothing or whenever I notice how short my hair is. Although sometimes the dysphoria comes for no apparent reason. Whenever it happens it makes me feel depressed and even anxious. Never thought I'd get anxiety by not looking feminine enough. Unfortunately I'm not on hrt and I still live with my parents so I can't wear any female clothing, which makes my dysphoria even worse. How do any of you deal with this dysphoria? I really need the help, because I don't think I can deal with this much longer."
[deleted],asktransgender,"Caught, Came Out, Sprinted back in the closet...What to do?","Two weeks ago, my wife found an email I had sent to a gender therapist asking to resume treatment.

So when faced with the evidence based point blank question, what did I do? I said it was a phase and it was already gone. Things have largely gone back to normal. However, my feelings have returned...with vengeance. 

I don't know what to do anymore....."
kinkachou,asktransgender,Is it common to change social groups after transitioning?,"I ask this because a friend of a friend has transitioned from male to female over the last few years. We hung out and talked at house parties because we had several nerdy interests in common. After transitioning to female, she has been a lot more outgoing and social and as a result has gained a lot of female friends and doesn't seem to be as interested in having nerdy conversations  with me or other guys as much anymore. 

I'm curious if this is because there's an aversion to continuing to be an acquaintance with someone who knew her as a man in favor of friends who have only known her as a woman, or if it's just part of a natural change in interests as a result of her being who she truly feels she is. 

On one hand, I feel a bit sad we can't just have nerdy conversations like before, but on the other hand I'm super proud of her for transitioning and becoming a popular and attractive woman. I'm just wondering how other people have felt about social group change after transitioning. 

Thank you very much for your input!"
Seburstian,asktransgender,Advice for being mid-transition and trying to break into tech?,"I have no idea if anyone can help, but I know the common stereotype is that every trans person on Reddit is in tech, so... I don't know, I figured it couldn't hurt to ask?

At any rate, I'm a recent (well, May) CS graduate from a small private university in the Midwest. Kansas City, more specifically. I had a pretty good GPA, some small projects, but no internships. I say mid-transition but, basically, I pass 100% but my legal name isn't changed yet and I also haven't been able to change my gender marker. Since graduating, I've just had zero luck in landing an interview - it's like I'm sending my resume into the void. The recent grad aspect is definitely working against me, especially since it seems like all the job postings here are looking for people with 3-5+ years of work experience. However, I kind of feel like the my legal status might be throwing people off, so I mention it as well.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, just...advice for people who work in software engineering and other tech related positions? And stories from people who've managed to land jobs without their legal information changed? I'm trying not to get discouraged, but it gets harder and harder the longer I'm unemployed. I could definitely use some inspiring stories."
deshypothequiez,asktransgender,What did you wish you knew before you started HRT?,"I'm AMAB, currently gender questioning (not sure if I want to fully transition, but definitely do not identify as male - hence my flair). I do know, however, that I would prefer a more androgynous and/or feminine presentation, and am interested in starting HRT. I've spoken to a doctor already and am in counseling.

I'm planning on scheduling a second appointment with the doctor to discuss starting, but want to come prepared with a set of questions to address. Obviously I know that HRT is a deeply personal experience, it affects people in different way, everyone has different concerns about what they want out of HRT, etc. But I think it'd be helpful to know what concerns other people might have had, what they wish they knew before they started, and what advice they'd have for someone still questioning.

Thanks :)"
nrdgrrrl_taco,asktransgender,I'm looking forward to my second year,"Sept 21st was my one year hrt anniversary. Thursday I talked to my doctor and we agreed to try adding progesterone, and I've been taking that for two days now.

I've had some great changes over the last year, including some pretty epic boob growth. Buy I still don't pass. I've legally changed my name and gender, but I'm still years away from SRS, and my lack of a vagina is starting to be more and more bothersome. I've read in many places that the second year is when more subtle but pervasive changes start to happen. I know there's little evidence of progesterone helping, but a good amount of anecdotal evidence.

And today was an emotional rollercoaster of a day. A close family member just came out to me as bisexual and possibly polyamourius- I'm the first person she's came out to (other than her husband) and I feel incredibly honoured and happy for her. At the same time, I had a long drawn out right over text with my best friend. I really love her but I'm so broken and I think I really hurt her and I think our friendship might be over. 

And to top it all off, there is this person who I dated once a little while ago. And I really liked/like her but it didn't work out. And I told her I couldn't do ""friends"" because I'm attracted to her and can't handle voluntary friendzone - and now she's re-establishef contact with me and is trying to be friends and I don't know if I can resist.

And I don't know if it's the progesterone or its just the enormity of the day but I can't stop crying, and the tears just feel so thick, and I'm so hopeful for the future, and so happy for my cousin and so sad at the loss of a friend.

And being a girl, being an adult, is hard. 

I'm doing ok. Sorry for the ramble, I just needed to get this all out there. I guess despite all of the heartache and pain, I really hope the second year is at least as exciting and complicated as the first."

So the thing is I am straight (mtf who likes guys). Growing up I was never one of those guys that said, ""check out that chick"" or ever even tried to ask a girl out. I had one girlfriend when I was 13 for about 6 months, that I was only really with because her mom told my mom that she was interested, but we never kissed or anything like that. So my parents just assumed it was because I was just really shy. I have also never shown any inclination to liking men and always thought i was Asexual (repressed feelings are a hell of a shock). My parents and sister still make it very clear that they think I'm attracted to women even going as far with trying to set me up with women. 

For some reason I think my family would be more okay with me being with a woman than a guy. Not to mention I  honestly believe it will go worse than when I came out as trans, if they ever see me with a guy or I tell them.
Am I just being paranoid? Anyone have a familiar experience?"

Transthrowawayy123,asktransgender,11 months on HRT and I'm having trouble with identity acceptance,"So I am a transwoman and I've been on HRT for about 11 months now but I have been trouble with my identity. 

I feel really crappy saying I identify as a woman because either I don't believe it or I'm incredibly judgmental of myself for it. If I identify as male(internally telling myself) a huge sigh of relief is swept over me(please bear with me)
 
BUT I like living as a woman. I like being gendered, seen, and treated as a woman. YET deep down I cant accept the woman identity without feeling funny in my head.
 Transition has been fine and all but identifying as a woman literally makes my head hurt(yes actual headaches). BUT ALSO on a sexual level having sex/getting off as a guy is not even remotely pleasurable.

Is it possibly internal transphobia/sexism that I never resolved. Its like since I know I'm born male I can change my outside but I'm still a guy? Or that my envy and jealous of woman is still not resolved and maybe that I live in between two lives still(still presenting male for work) Maybe its just a weird life/brain hack that I have to use?

 Why does identifying as a woman internally killing me? If I was born a cis girl I wouldn't have this problem. I would simply be and that's that. No effort to pass, no effort to prove I'm trans to anyone(In that respect I feel like I went from one mask to another). 

I guess I should also add I still live at home with not very supportive people of my transition nor myself. It's very selfish the way my family treats me. ""I am embarrassed by you"" -My sweet mother and sister

My face is very androgynous, I have a more or less small body, and since I have long curly hair, and often wear girlish clothes and whatnot, I'm sometimes mistaken as a girl, heck even one of my friends calls me a trap. But I like being like this, and I would love to have a true girl body, but I feel like I'm a man. Even my voice is halfway between man and woman. I have never done anything sexual, even when I had the chance, just because I feel like this is not my real body, that I should have a girls genitals. I like girls btw.  These feelings are really weird and I do not know what to think/do. I just am sure that I don't want to have a man's thing down there, but still feel like a dude. I recently made it to 19 years old."

Since this happen to me before I didn't really think it would be related until one of my Co workers said that your pelvic could be rotating in a bad spot and the planks help with keeping it in the correct spot.

Have anyone had lower back pain due to pelvic tilt while on HRT?"

SeaSaltSong,asktransgender,Apparently I also transitioned from introvert to extrovert,"And it sucks. I spent my whole life introverted. It as draining to spend time with people so I kept my social circles small and mostly online.

Almost a year on hormones and half a year presenting female I found myself to be more extroverted now. I crave time with friends. A lot of it. I try filling all my free time with it if I can.

The problem is that I spent so long with only a few close friends that my pool of hanging out is very small. To top it off I have trouble making new friends because everyone my age is working 3 jobs just to survive, and the others that are younger have trouble keeping a commitment to save their lives.

I feel like a leper. It's not even because I'm trans. Just shitty people.

Besides feeling great mentally, I had a less than favorable reaction to both Spiro and estrogen.  For E I tried pills sublingually and then IM injections.  So basically I had to stop due a bad reaction.

Was just wondering if anyone here has experienced this (below) personally or knows someone who has?

I took spiro for a very short time, ~1 week then stopped.  For the remainder of the time ~3 months I was only taking E (3 weeks Sublingual, the rest IM gluteal injections).

Symptoms Experienced - Bad Acid Reflux, Feeling or need to cough (itchy throat and also need to cough up phlegm), large quantity of phlegm in throat (post nasal drip?), difficulty swallowing at times, difficulty concentrating.  Most of the above symptoms could possibly be related to the Acid Reflux issue, but I don't know?

Anyway, I really want to continue, but am afraid that even if going to a doctor these symptoms will continue and it won't be possible.  So to my original question, has anyone experienced this (or anything similar) or know of someone who has?"

I'm transmasculine, nonbinary, and reluctantly pre-anything medical, partially because I'm really concerned about how transitioning would affect my access to sports communities and being able to compete because it's all so gendered. I'm a fairly competitive cross country skier and recreational cross country runner.

Like, psychologically, how much of your performance can you put on hormones as opposed to your own effort and work? Because testosterone is literally a steroid, what criteria are there for when to switch competition categories or whether you should just stop competing completely during transition? 

I feel like I wouldn't feel comfortable entering in the men's category because I probably wouldn't pass for a long time, and even if I passed in normal clothes, I'm scared that I'd get shit for not physically conforming while in my race spandex because there's no way I'm binding while doing sports.

I just have a lot of anxieties about this and am curious what people's experiences have been.

I found a better first name recently, so I came out &amp; changed it on Facebook for National Coming Out Day. I don't want to change it legally again right this instant, because no one questions that [current legal name] and [birth name] are the same person, which means that if I can just wait a couple more years (for Reasons that are too complicated and boring to get into) I'll never have to come out to my estranged family.

But I do want to start using it anywhere I can, and the sheer number of places that use one's name is pretty overwhelming. So: when you changed your name socially, where did you start using it before filing for a legal change? What order did you do things in? When did you start using the new name professionally? Did you find that any organizations you wouldn't have expected were willing to use it before it was legally changed, like healthcare, insurance, etc.?"

fuzzybad,asktransgender,This was a good week.,"Not really a question, just wanted to share my experience this week.

Monday, I had my name legally changed in Illinois.  The court was great, the DMV was great (I was able to change my gender marker with a letter from my therapist).  The only thing that sucked was they gave me a temporary license which I can't use to update my social security account.  So I have to wait on that until I get my real license in the mail.  I informed my employer of my name change.

Tuesday, my employer asked me to review an email they intended to send to all employees regarding my transition.  It was actually quite respectful and I approved it.  Basically it just said my name had changed, I preferred female pronouns, and I would be allowed to use the ladies room.  Our head of HR, who is a nice lady, actually gave me a hug!

Wednesday morning, did my 34th weekly E injection. :)

Wednesday afternoon, the email went out to all employees and... the world failed to stop turning.  My coworkers were either indifferent or were happy for me.  Funny how I worried literally for years how people would react if I transitioned, and in reality it's no big deal for most.  I used the ladies room in the office for the first time and it was wonderful.. twice the size of the mens room and it even has a waiting area with chairs.  Luxury!

Ok, so to comply with rule 1:  If you have transitioned at work, what was your experience like?

tao-nui,asktransgender,Last night was my first night girl mode; I'm not okay..,"Hi reddit,

Last night was my first time girl mode. A friend of mine (let's call him Jessie) had a party organized by his brother for Halloween. He suggested that ""hey, let's use that as an occasion to go girl mode!"". He's agender but he likes to dress and dance in heels, which is amazing. So for a week we prepared: We went to the capital to look for clothes for me, and go through all the thrift shop we could find. I have now officially more girl clothes than boy's ones! Digressing. So I bought a nice dress, a wig, makeup, and I had my makeup done by a friend. And then we went to the party: 40 ish people, everyone was costumed

At first I was really nervous and my dysphoria went through the roof. After we took a few pictures, I looked at them and I freaked out because my i felt like my male features were screaming under the makeup. As people were arriving we had the grace of every single person commenting on how fabulous we were. ""it's scary how feminine you look"" they said. ""I really asked myself if you were a girl when I came in"". ""Dude you're sexy"". ""Nice ass"". And all kind of personal opinions. People insisted on gendering me as a male tho, and that was not so pleasant to go through. But I didn't let myself go negative, and I tried to enjoy things. 

We danced, we sang, and we had a pretty great night. Later during the night I realized I forgot that I was dressed in girl mode and I was just being myself. I let go. I wasn't bothered anymore by ""How the heck should I behave"", I was just socializing and enjoying things.

Fast forward to 4 am, end of the party, beginning of the after. I was tired of wearing heels and I wanted to remove my makeup that was going a little weak. I went to the bathroom and went back to boy mode, jeans t-shirt and short-ish hair.  On my way out I came across some guy, and from there things went top to rock bottom. He smiled and said ""Woaw haha, back to reality"".

He didn't realize how much those words were violent to me. He didn't know, I couldn't hate him for that, I was at a halloween party, dressing a girl but hiding in the closet. But it planted a terrifying seed in my head. I feel like no matter how hard I try I will never be a girl. I would always be a copy. A neo girl, with a neo vagina. I felt fake, I felt like I was trying to fool everyone.

I went out to calm down and talked to Jessie who helped me by telling me that ""You're not trying to fool anyone, you are trying to be yourself"". I know he was right, but I can't stop thinking about how pissed off I am for not just being born a girl. We went back in, and at some point I got mad jealous (and almost angry) of a friend of us who is super cute, with a high pitched, soft voice. That feeling almost scared me, because it was the first time that it was so violent.

It's been a day now and I still feel really weird. I feel a bit depressed, and I feel like I did something wrong for cross dressing. I am not really feeling suicidal but… last night I felt like I wanted to go to sleep for a long time, and forget that I exist.
 I don't really know why I feel the need to write it down. What should I do? Am I ever going to stop feeling like I belong nowhere? A misfit?


I am lost, and empty. I want to hide. I want to stop feeling.

WytchHunter23,asktransgender,Following the breadcrumbs.,"I've had a very rocky experience with my identity. Well, rocky as far as my experience goes. For me I've never had any defining thing that i can say ""that's what makes me trans"". And often i doubt myself. 

However, there is definitely plenty of breadcrumbs. I just have trouble trusting then because of my family and religious upbringing. Because of my mental health problems I'm reliant on my family because i lack the independence to move out our get a job, although I've tried full time study several times with varying results.

I really need some support, so I'll share my breadcrumbs. The first one is that I've never gotten along well with masculine guys. There was always something about them that intimidated me. They reminded me that i wasn't like them, i didn't want to be like them. I usually played sport in mixed teams, netball and volley ball, and i started that from the age of 5.

I think that's the reason i never really felt any discontent in my early life. Most my friends were girls, i played on sports teams as the only guy, but didn't feel treated differently, and i had plenty of best friends that were girls growing up. 

Approaching the end of primary school and the start of high school was when i first started having discontent. i had read that some guys are XXY and develope breasts in puberty, and so i hoped i would, for a long time. Because my religion taught that boys were born with boy spirits and girls with girls, i struggled a lot internally through my teenage years. I'd invent wild fantasies where i was an elf or a werewolf, and female. I think by entertaining ideas that i knew were impossible i could entertain the idea of being really a girl inside, because there was no other way to even think about it without having a war inside with my faith. 

I think my faith combined with my early interactions with lots of female friends is why i never did anything like steel my sister's underwear or cross dress. That just wasn't me, it wasn't OK. Boys had boy spirits and girls had girls. I think i can remember spending a lot of time mulling that over thinking there might be some loop hole....

In the end i try to invalidate myself, saying there isn't enough of this or there wasn't that. But the breadcrumbs are all there.

I'm just quite... quite lost.

I'm 18, pansexual, cis male, and up until a few months ago, in a relationship with a cisgender girl. I have been in exactly two relationships, both with cisgendered women.

Now, recently I found someone on tinder I really liked talking to (I know, Tinder, *hur hur* ) and I'll call him Dallon. He's a FTM transgender boy and we went on a date on Thursday. I know it's early and we aren't even officially dating, yet but the day was honestly amazing.

Spending time with him, everything we did was, honestly, amazing.

But, as the title suggests, I am not out to my parents. If Dallon and I begin to date properly, I do not want to hide it from them, but at the same time, they are strong semi-conservative Christians who were opposed to me having a *bisexual* girlfriend. My family at large is also completely Christian and largely conservative.

My parents do love me. They just see me in bad situations and in danger when I am not, and I. Well, I like Dallon very much.

Basically, I'm asking for advice on how to come out to your parents that you're dating a transgender guy you met on the internet, for if it happens.

And I know that most of the time blood work is done to address current levels to determine what dosage is healthy, etc. How long does blood work take, and can I expect to start HRT this same month/early next month?

Is there anything I can do to prepare for the first appointment to speed the process, and can I ask for blockers/anti-androgens on the first visit? I have relatively feminine features right now that I would like to preserve to a fine point as much as possible before starting the estrogens.

In the meantime while I wait, what do you recommend I do to progress my social transition as well as medical?"
katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,Was anyone else not in a rush to pass and just did HRT until they began to male-fail? How did that work out for you?,"Let's say one was considering starting HRT but knew they had a long journey ahead of them, possibly involving facial surgery.  
  
Let's also say one had a deep fear of not passing, to the point of just rather staying birth gender until the hormones made that impossible.  
  
Has anyone else tried such a transition?  What are your experiences?"
mw18582,asktransgender,fear of making the wrong decision either way,"Hi lovely people of Reddit,

I am assigned male at birth, 33 years old and am becoming increasingly confused about my gender identity. I am very much scared of regretting decisions I will or will not make, either way, 10 years down the road.

I have always been a tad bit feminine, but not overly. I am attracted to femininity (mostly in women; sometimes in men; I have done things, but consider myself mostly heterosexual as a man; or gay as a women; depending on my pov.).
I had the goth phase, wear make-up most of the time, sit like most ladies do and easily get emotional and cry. (I don't like stereotyping these attributes in general, but it's hard making a point without.). I had my share of depression, self- harm and things I really do not relate to this whole issue but can't be sure they aren't either. At any rate, my life has been okay since my late 20s and the people that know me would mostly describe me as a feminine guy.

Things got more complicated when thrift-shopping earlier this year with my girlfriend. I like cross- dressing, especially in safe environments like certain parties allow. We had a great time shopping for the occasion. I feel so happy when I try these beautiful white flanel dresses and all and she confirms it looks really cute on me. I just shine. I feel pretty. Until I see my face and just hate all that is masculine about it. The monstrous proportions of the shoulders. The absolute lack of shape otherwise. But mostly. The face. 

It is hard to imagine life as a woman. I don't know what to think about it. The weirdest thing is that I don't think I would regret it either. At worst, I would be 'meh, whatever' about it. But the idea of living as a male? That depresses me instantly. It's just so utterly confusing. It's not like I want to get rid of my sex organs. I am perfectly happy about it. Although I wouldn't mind it replaced too. The best dreams I had were of me fully as a woman; together with a woman.

I am utterly confused and really not sure what steps to take. Hopefully someone here with more experience could give some insights or ideas how to get closer to some resolution :)

Edit: What was it for you that gave you the final push or insight; or what thought changed your mind about it and gave you closure for once and all?

Alitagraham,asktransgender,Hi guys. I found a book that might help those of you still questioning or trying to come to terms with your gender identity.,"The book is called The Gender Quest Workbook. It was designed with young adults and teenagers in mind, however it may help some older people as well.  ISBN: 978-1-62625-297-4

It begins with discussing gender and self: identity and expression. 

From there it begins discussing gender and social life: family, friends, school/work, and sex and sexual relationships. 

From there it has a chapter on intersectionality which is super awesome. 

The last chapter brings up challenges, feelings, and anxieties you may face in transition and ways to cope. 

Btw I found this at Aardvark Books in SF (Church and Market) if you want to get it it is 8.50 there. The msrp is 16.95 USD. "
justicartrutrans,asktransgender,Does this coming out letter look OK?,"I'm going to be starting T soon which means I need to come out to my grandmas. I love them both and I am especially close to my grandma on my mum's side of the family. She is in her 90s and her memory is not good. She has lived a mostly sheltered, insulated life (apart from her childhood in WWII England), and she is conservative but not religious or prejudiced.

My main worry is that she might not get it and find that it takes her a while to learn and adjust to the change. So I want to make sure that I put it well. I would really appreciate your thoughts on it.

By the way, I identify as non-binary, but I am coming out to my family as a trans man because I feel like it's easier for most cis people to understand and respect, and I am happy with presenting masculine and having 'he' pronouns, and I am going to be taking T and eventually getting top surgery.

Dear Grandma &lt;name&gt;, 

I'm looking forward to coming to stay with you soon, and I'm sorry that I keep delaying, and that I have not phoned you back. There was something I wanted to talk to you about first, and I thought it might be best if I put it in writing because I am quite nervous and unsure what to say, and I have been taking my time trying to figure out how to say it. You have always done everything you can to be supportive and understanding towards me and I love and appreciate you immensely, which is why I have been anxious to make sure that I put this in the best words possible.

After mum died, I focused so much on coping with the bereavement that there were other issues that were never properly addressed when they should have been. It’s only recently, after almost ten years, that I really feel like I am starting to heal from that loss, so I’m starting to understand things about myself better. 

There is one thing about myself that has been hard to come to terms with and hard to know how to explain, but I have to say it. Most people have an innate sense of what their gender is, and sometimes it doesn't match up with the one on their birth certificate. I have always had this sense of misalignment, otherwise known as gender dysphoria. I was brought up to be a girl but I know that I am a transgender boy. I didn't choose to feel this way, but I believe I might not find happiness unless I can live as a man, so I am telling you this.

As a result I am making some personal changes to my name and appearance towards the end of my own sense of happiness and fulfilment. I have tried my best to keep in mind what I think Mum would have wanted for me in my name change if she were here to support me. I am supported by Dad, &lt;stepmum&gt;, &lt;brother&gt;, &lt;cousin&gt;, &lt;boyfriend&gt;, as well all my friends, and I hope that I have your support too. In the end I hope that the only thing this changes between us is that you will love me as your grandson rather than your granddaughter.

Lots of love,
&lt;my new full name&gt;"
Marscreature,asktransgender,Came out on facebook,"I'm 30 mtf I've been on hormones since February. Boy mode has long died and my closet is filled with new clothes. I've been coming out to loved ones individually for months now trying to keep as many people in my life as possible. Last night my wife and I decided it was time to do the deed. I started by texting the people I had been putting off telling, my brother and my dad. My brother took it great my dad did not respond. I posted a long well written coming out post and the response was amazing so much love and support it was all I've ever dreamed of. Then my wife got a phone call from my mom. My dad called her drunk and angry and scared her good she said that if he came over we were to call the cops and not let him in. So far I only lost one person could be worse. How did your coming out meet or not meet your expectations?"
[deleted],asktransgender,"Spending Christmas alone with my grandparents, not allowed to correct them, advice?","So this year I'll be spending Christmas with my grandparents (mother's side) whilst my parents are down south spending it with my father's side. 

My grandmother has been a pain in the ass since I came out, she's refused to use my correct pronouns and is sure that I'm ""not going to go all the way"" with transition, even though I'm aggressively saving for SRS. An example of her current attitude comes from a couple of weeks ago, when I went to her/my parent's business to bring them coffee. They had a new employee whom I'd never met, and my grandmother immediately stated  that ""That's Tori, **he** changed **his** name, it used to be (deadname)"".

I've been told repeatedly by my mother that I'm not allowed to correct her and that I should just grin and bear it, but I'm honestly considering just bailing on Christmas this year so I don't have to deal with her bullcrap. It's really sad, I love my grandparents more than anything, but my grandmother's not treating me with any respect right now and my parents are push-overs when it comes to her.

I'm just really concerned, I don't think I can get out of the holiday, I'm not allowed to correct her, and I'm not really up to being deadnamed and misgendered by her all day.
Any advice?"
15thcateringwillow,asktransgender,Is there an idiot's guide for Name/Gender changes in the state of California?,"hi everyone!! ^usually i lurk, but i wasn't able to find a solution for myself, so i decided to go ahead and make a post.

I'm mtf, i'm wanting to change my name and gender, but.....gosh this is so confusing. Even with the guide from the California Law Center, I'm still confused as fuck.  

Is there, like a *simple* guide out there?

I just want to change my name and gender as fast as possible and as cheap as possible. I dont have a job at the moment, I know its possible to get a fee waiver, but i'm just really confused.  I'm actually filled out most of the paper work, and I *think* i've done it correctly, i'm just lost on how to move forward and actually do the deed.

 
Help?

Jassy2cute,asktransgender,What month could you experience female orgasm?,"What month could my MtF sisters feel the female orgasm? I think I got mine last night, I'm 1.5 months in. Not sure if i imagined it or if things are really starting to change.

Thanks in advance"
ThrownAwayTransGirl,asktransgender,I'm Terrified That I Botched My Transition,"I know I've posted about this a lot but. 

I just can't believe I never got my levels tested. I don't know why everyone just let this happen. I can't believe spiro is so shit and I wasn't even taking enough and nobody ever told me.

The worst part is that back when I was 14 I was trying to see Maddie Deutsch in LA. But I was too impatient to start HRT, and my sessions with the therapist kind of fell through. Plus it was two hours away. But I know that she would have at least gotten my levels right, and I might have gone on injections or patches instead of pills, and I probably wouldn't have had to wait as long (I started DIYing like six months after that, six months of extra masculinizing). 

So ironically, it seems like my impatience screwed me over bigtime. And I have nobody to blame but myself and my own stupidity. I can't even imagine what I would look like now if I hadn't screwed this up. 

So I'm going to die soon. And I don't even feel as bad about it as I have before. It's really scary. But if there's really nothing else I can do (and I can't, because I can't go back in time), then I won't have any nagging thoughts when I finally do die. Dysphoria has completely taken over my life and I just want it to be over now. I have an appointment with my endo in two weeks to probably confirm that spiro did nothing, and I don't know if I can even last that long. I was supposed to visit my girlfriend in December and I definitely won't last that long. I feel so bad for the other people in my life. I wish I could have lived up to their expectations. I'm sorry."
slytherlin,asktransgender,Health class making my dysphoria much worse.,"This is mostly a venting post, honestly, idk.

My health class (just the basic level one that most universities require) covers the difference in fitness/nutrition between cis male and cis female people, but it makes me feel so goddamn dysphoric.

My professor is a very sweet lady who definitely is just used to teaching along cisnormative lines, but whenever she says things like ""male bodies have lower body fat"" or ""men produce more testosterone"" or when she pulls up diagrams of male bodies.... I honestly feel sick. Like I want to cry or puke or something. I always leave those lectures feeling disgusted with my body and just wanting to die.

I've been doing pretty well recovering from an eating disorder which was largely triggered by dysphoria, since of course (/s) male bodies have lower body fat. But having to listen to cis people talking about ""male bodies"" and ""female bodies"" has been making me so damn sad.

I brought it up to my therapist, and she definitely had some good tips (mainly she said I should just leave the damn room next time, lol).

But I can't help but feel like I'm being over-sensitive. Like literally how pathetic is it that I'm triggered by health professionals talking about biology. I feel like one of the bad caricatures of trans people that alt right people mock when they make jokes about being ""triggered"" or ""assuming genders.""

Has anyone else had similar experiences? :/"
niku_j97,asktransgender,Scared,"I am too scared. It is all okay when I'm all alone minding my own business or talking to a select few around me. But when I'm around girls or see a couple I feel broken, it all reminds me how big I am or how masculine, my voice suddenly starts sounding more manlier somehow compared to those girls and that scares me.

Today when I went to canteen with some friends I crashed into this group and idk I didn't feel like being alive, I was cursing myself from inside.

Not just that I see girls doing their stuff, talking about dresses or sharing their incidences on how they cried and how friends talked them out. I too cry but in private and even if I tell mom  she scolds me for that and tells me to man up and stuff. She knows me well, also I've told her but she believes it a childist fetish.

I know everyone has their own problems, so I don't feel like sharing and even if I share people don't care.

My parents think college is not the right time for therapist, I should rather focus on studies.How could I possibly focus on career if I living like this."

LGBTQ MENTAL HEALTH SYMPOSIUM

*Registration payment includes Credit Cards and Interfund Transfers ONLY.
TARGET AUDIENCE
Healthcare professionals who work with, or may have the potential to work with, LGBTQ clients and their families. This may include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, counselors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, or any other interested healthcare professional.
DESCRIPTION
Recent local, national and worldwide events have raised an awareness of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community. One particular area of concern is LGBTQ-related mental health issues. Research shows that LGBTQ individuals, due to stigma and discrimination, are at higher risk for certain conditions such as depression, anxiety, suicide and substance abuse. 

Unfortunately, many LGBTQ individuals do not seek mental health care because of a perception that they will not be understood or that they will be judged by health care providers and facilities. Consequently, there exists a very real healthcare disparity in the LGBTQ community. 

In an effort to help educate the community about the needs and challenges that surround LGBTQ mental health, Charlotte AHEC is hosting an LGBTQ in Mental Health Symposium.

mynameisryanx,asktransgender,"21, transgender, pre-op. I have huge crush on a straight guy and I don't know what to do.","So, I recently started uni. There's this one guy in my course who's super cute and really caught my attention from day 1, not just because of his looks but also because of his super friendly personality.

We really got along, went out together (in groups obviously) and stuff, and he was very nice. A couple of days ago, I found out people were spreading rumours and talking sh*t about me (I wasn't out). So, I decided to make things clear and came out as trans to the whole class. 

My crush told me he already knew because ""I'm super feminine and usually biological girls are not as feminine"" and kept complimenting me about my looks, my voice etc. 

Sometimes he seems to be looking for me (some people from my course said that he seems really flirty with me, without me telling them that I like him). Today, I got to uni and he barely said ""hi"" to me. He talked to me really randomly like he would do to any other person and didn't really pay that much attention to me as he usual does. He actually paid more attention to my friend than me.

This p*ssed me off so much, and I just don't understand him.
It's like, sometimes he's super flirty, super supportive and super friendly, some other times it feels like he doesn't even care about me being there.

I don't know what to do, and I'm starting to feel hurt. I know a relationship wouldn't be possible and also, considering that he keeps changing attitude towards me, I don't think it's healthy to keep thinking about me.

How do I forget him? I really do like him, but it's getting to much for me and I don't wanna be hurt."
torienby,asktransgender,"Changing universities to get away from people who knew my deadname/me pre-transition, am I being dumb?","So I changed my name a few months ago, and unfortunately I'm having issues with people who know my deadname at my university not being super cooperative when it comes to changing over and generally getting crap from people who knew me pre-transition. 

So, I'm changing universities. I think it'll be nice to go somewhere nobody knows me from prior to transition. My other option is to change programs to psychology at the same university and move to a different campus (which I've already gotten approved for, as a backup plan).
I know some really incredible people on our campus, and like half of our queer society's committee is trans, but I feel like I'm better off trying somewhere new and trying to meet some new people (to be honest I don't really have many friends at my current university).

It's really making me uncomfortable being deadnamed all of the time, and I think this might be a good move/fresh start for me since I've been at my current university for four years now.

Am I being a little dumb here?"
CorbutoZaha,asktransgender,Transitioning as a professional with clients and rainmaking,"So I have been looking for some guidance from older transitioners who have already gone through this process. This thread https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1jd7ya/coming_out_to_clients_at_work/?st=IUYJLU88&amp;sh=8d7d5dfc was close but not quite there...

I am in a pretty male dominated profession (architecture) that has a huge problem with representation of cis women and minorities...basically anyone who isn't a white cis male. For example in america only 20% of licensed architects are women and something like 3% are minorities. 

I'm on the verge of starting transition. I am well into my career and on the verge of partnership in my firm. I'm concerned about how clients will react and my ability to attract clients to continue working. Has anyone gone through this and come out alive? I am under no illusions that there are many(any?) architects out there, but if anyone who deals with clients and have to bring in work could weigh in I'd appreciate it. Thanks!"
xyukii,asktransgender,Tall Girls - How do you deal with height?,"As the title suggests, I'm really struggling to cope with being tall (6'2 or 6'3). Having disliked my height for as long as I can remember, I just want to blend in. Really wish it didn't bother me so much, but it's been driving me to tears most days and feels like it's such a barrier to feeling confident and passable while out in public.

I've been on HRT for 2 years, living full-time around my few friends since moving out, and dress very femme/ androgynous in public (I don't own boy-clothes anymore). The issue I'm having is I'm really struggling to imagine I'll ever be comfortable with myself, or will ever fit in with being on the extreme end of the height spectrum.

Just curious if anyone has experienced the same feelings and can offer any advice? \^\^;"
Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,PSA: Today is national coming out day!,"Hey there /r/transgender! In case people weren't aware, today, October 11th is national coming out day! 

There are many of you whom have just started your transitions, others who have only started the introspective of the possibility of being trans and also many of you whom have been transitioning a while. If you're one the fence about coming out, or being open, let me give you some motivation!

I came out a week ago, and I'm fairly visibly trans. I never thought I'd be the one to do this but I did. And I didn't just do this to my closest friends and relatives. I blasted it on Facebook for literally everyone who knows me to see! Since then I've been able to go out as the real me, engage my friends as my true self for the first time. This experience is so liberating. It's been weird at first, and the whole time I can help but think ""what the hell am I doing?"" But it's been worth every second of awkwardness! There's no more hiding. My experience thus far has been overwhelmingly positive, and I know that won't last forever as there are assholes In the world. But I did this for me, and honestly it's one of the best things I could have done for myself! 

If you feel stuck, if you feel weighed down, why not give it a try. You may be surprised by what others have to say, maybe not. But you can live as yourself for yourself. Unless of course you know for a fact that you will be met with immediate violence, then maybe plan your coming out today. Write you're letters, your thoughts, maybe tell a best friend or a sibling. This time should be yours and I know you can do it! 


Happy coming out day and hearts to all of you wonderful people :)  

Edit: a word"
SafeHayven,asktransgender,I f-cking hate being trans,"I'm fucking done with being trans. Done with it. I get deadnamed, misgendered, and guilt-tripped by my family, and my cishet friends mock me for caring about my family's bigotry rather than ""real problems"" like bombings in Aleppo. 

I'm just so fucking done with it. I want to detransition or go deep stealth. I want to go by my birth name or have no one know that my chosen name isn't my birth name. I absolutely cannot take being openly trans anymore; I would rather drop dead."
ChromiumGirl,asktransgender,DAE think Agents of SHIELD is a pretty good Trans show?,"So I am catching up on the new season and it just really stands out to me. While Marvel has traditionally used Mutants as the stand in for racism and prejudice in their stories, this forced switch to using Inhumans seems to have serendipitously landed them in a position to put the lens on people whose stories are analogous to our own. 

I mean, they literally go through transition with terragenisis. I giggle every time they talk about it. There's plenty on the acceptance angle and how they are different but still the same. Some are even passable as humans and some of them are forced to live with the resulting visibility of the process and how that effects and divides them. Humans view them as little walking nuclear level super weapon just waiting to destroy modern civilization, just like the Pope and others seems to want to label us. It really feels quite brilliant. Kudos Marvel.

Also feels like they just deserve praise in general for the wonderful diversity of the cast. Even Coulson as the white male lead appears (deceivingly enough) more middle aged office worker speed than the typical square jawed super spy action hero (Lookin' at you Squid-Ward). 

Also, Inhumans may all be left handed... so just one more reason for me to love 'em. Am I alone? Am I crazy? Does Marvel deserve more credit for this than they seem to get?"
_goldenpothos_,asktransgender,Has anyone else been the Grinch of every holiday until after coming out? (Or awhile after),"I'm just realizing that for years I've hated literally every holiday. I didn't even celebrate my birthday for years. I'm actually excited for Halloween which is shocking. I guess its because I can be myself? Its been about 5 years after came out and started T and I'm finally like able to manage holidays. I used to be a real Grinch/edgelord like ""don't give me gifts I'm staying home"" ""I don't wanna go out celebrating is dumb."" 

I really hated having to see relatives who would always call me by the wrong name or pronouns and I was in a really vulnerable place. Now its not so much like that anymore and I really appreciate gifts and giving now. Before it was like ""ugh material possessions"" now I see its really just showing the other person you actually like them and its all in good fun (lol). 

I get choose who I get to see on holidays and probably will have a good time handing candy on halloween to the youngins. Maybe its also because I grew up. Who knows. I'm wondering if any of you all had similar experiences and know that its ok if you are still a Grinch because sometimes I revert back too hahaha."
DialgaTheTimeLord,asktransgender,Am I transgender...?,"Oh boy... I've been meaning to get this off my chest for a while... 

Okay, let me start with some basics. I'm 19, male, interested in women, with no concerns about genitalia, in college for media arts, and I went to private Christian schools for quite a while, so I was exposed to a lot of lgbtq phobias, only going to public school for 12th. Honestly, my main group was mostly lgbtq during that year. I don't think I have depression exactly, but I do have strong social anxiety. 

About a year or so ago, I met some really awesome  online, through an Undertale rp (this is probably gonna include a lot of nerdy Undertale things, as forewarning). At the beginning, I rp'd as Sans, a male character, but a lot of my later characters were female, including Toriel, Undyne, Clam Girl (yes, even her), Red (fangame UT Red), and even my own oc. Even when I was younger and played make-believe (we've all done it), I often found myself wanting to be a girl character.

I only started thinking about all this a few months ago, probably after realizing how often I rp as female characters. I've noticed I've sorta been looking at myself differently in the mirror, I've been trying to grow my hair out  (thank God for my genetics), I've realized just how much I hate body hair (damn genetics), I wonder what I'd look like as a girl, and I find myself loathing my default voice range (which I have to some extent for a while).

If I am, I'm not sure how a lot of people I know in real life would take it, but I've been asking my online friend Jude about it, since she's trans, without actually saying I'm considering it. I've also joined a sexuality and gender acceptance club, but have yet to attend since Media Arts club gets in the way. So, in short... I need help."

But she's not and over the last five years we have been through CAMS to Tavistock &amp; Portman (it's a UK thing) and now my child has transitioned in school and everywhere really into a wonderful confident thirteen year old.

Just wanted to say thank you, very badly of me I can't remember names, one girl even got her mum to email me, thanks for that too.

Ruby_mtf,asktransgender,Can someone successfully present as both male and female regularly?,"After questioning and working things out I sort of want to be more feminine as a man but I also want to be a passable woman. I don't want to transition full time but I do want hrt. I feel that a woman can pass as a man easier then a man can plus being male I really don't want to lose my hair as I grow older. But I'm wondering am I taking the easy way out? I do feel like a man at times and sometimes I feel like a woman. I don't want to take this with me to work and really don't want many family members knowing. 

So basically I want to have two sides, I want to be a passable female, and passable male. I have certain advantages as a guy that  I don't want to give up. I also love my name and never want to get rid of it. I do have a nick name that is usually asccociated with women so that's not going to be a weird change. 

I guess I have a couple questions. 

1. Will hrt make me want to become a woman full time? 

2. Can I successfully stay as I am but also let my womanhood out? I'm talking more so about going to the movies, out with friends, etc. I'd likely be a super tomboyish woman. Or am I just being stupid and denial about wanting to transition? 

3. Once you start hrt, did your desire to transition wane? "

Terracorner,asktransgender,Is it normal to hit a phase of not caring after accepting oneself?,"I've been questioning for over a year, with the result being that I think I'm trans. My parents, though not perfect, were surprisingly okay with the possibility of me being trans. And lately, I have been seeing a therapist that is WPATH associated and he has been helping me sort through some of this stuff.

Ever since all of this has gone right for me, though, I have suddenly found myself caring a lot less about the gender issue. I acknowledge that I'd rather have been born a girl and I still enjoy cross-gender fantasies, but sometimes it seems like purely an intellectual exercise that manifests only as a weak envy. It's more like an obsession has abated than a shroud of apathy.

Did anyone else have a similar experience and end up transitioning? End up not transitioning?"
no437,asktransgender,"My brain on hormones, ugly family business and the need for FFS - surgeons to look up?","Hello everybody.

Things have been coming together for me surprisingly quickly recently. I finally got perscribed hormones beginnign of september. And even though i am having serious doubts my doctor is handling my treatment in the optimal way i am glad that step is behind me. I am aware HRT affects everyone differently but for me it works like magic on my mind.
If i had any doubts or insecureties about my identity before they are gone now along with all the other mess in my mind.
My family however didn't come around in the meantime and in fact the situation seems to be worsening over time. I guess them calling me by my now official female name is off the table. My mother especially thinks that i am sick for being trans and according to her the entire concept of being transgender is sick and perverse. I am not too upset however since moving rather far away seems to have become a real possibility recently, which would allow me to break with my family and also get me a new doctor in one step.


I am the kind of person who can't just sit idely by when there is still work to be done and so with that chapter of my transition coming to a close i want to plan out the next as best i can.
Ever sicne i made the decision to go ahead with transition it was clear for me that the goal was to go stealth as my new self and since i am planning on moving pretty far i ideally would want to just use that opportunity to do just that at my new place of residence.
Even prior to any treatment i tried presenting female in public and at least from what i can tell i seem to not have a giant problem passing.
In the beginning i generally didn't get gendered at all but noone said anything or gave em dirty looks either. I have actually except for one instance on the phone never been gendered male ever since i started presenting female publicly. By now i get ma'amed or called a lady more often and i also started using female facilities like dressing rooms and restrooms without any problems. The nagging bit at the back of my mind that makes me think that everyone obviously knows and just plays along still is as active as ever though.

That said i still think that FFS would aid me greatly in achieving my goal and also be more content with myself.
Now i have been on HRT officially for only a month and about as long on DIY medication and i do understand that the treatment needs time to show full effects. However the move is still some time off and the research,planning,booking and waiting stages for surgery are sure to take some more time as well so i think it is reasonable to start on this endeavor as early as i can.
I am sure there are many girls here who had FFS done who could help out a poor recluse like me who doesn't know the first thign about how to go about this.

Sadly i am a bit limited on funds so i might not be able to affors surgeons in the US who generally tend cost a lot more and might have to look to thailand or other cheaper alternatives. I know FFS is expensive no matter how you spin it but every cent counts here for me.
I will be making pictures to send out to as many Surgeons and possible to get opinions on procedures and price quotes.
What are some surgeons/clinics i should consider that might accommodate a smaller purse?
The procedures i want done most likely are chin and Jaw reconture, rhinoplasty and hairline correction. Maybe a forhead reconture if possible.
If any of you had these procedures done and can reocmmend a surgeon to check out please let me know.
I am thankfull for any tips i can get."
Constancegoaway,asktransgender,"I think I'm going to be kicked out of my parents house, what to do.","Hiya, throwaway.  So I'm 29, ive lived by myself in the past but since then have started going to school to try to get an education, and have been living at my parents.  

My parents weren't too happy about me transitioning m2f but they knew about it.  It was kind of a don't mention it type of deal.  

I had my plan setup so I would be getting an aestheticians licence, and eventually go to makeup school.  

However, things have been rocky with my parents and my mom has continually told me that she doesn't want me living with her.  My school education wouldn't end for at least another year and a half, and as my body keeps changing my parents seem to be less and less supportive.  I'm walking on thin ice and any slipup of my tongue would surely get me kicked out at this point.  I know that deep down inside my parents love me and want the best for me but they see me as good for nothing, leeching, embarrassment.  I'm currently making under $500 a month in a part time job, and studying web design as wait for the aesthetician cohort to open up.  

All I want is my parents to be supportive of me and support my decisions and career plans and not threaten to kick me out whenever they're angry at me.  

I do believe I need a plan though if I get kicked out, and would like and advice you all could give.  The thought of my abandoning my career plans sucks but I suppose I just gotta do what I need to do...

So what's going for me is that I do own a car, am familiar with the food banks in the area, and I have a bit of savings.  Mentally I'm stable.  

Whats bad is that I live in sf bay, where the amount I make is not even a half of what I would need to make rent every month.  On that note I will look into low income housing tomorrow.  

Living with friends for any extended period is not an option, and I am not looking for any handout.  

I just want to learn how I can succeed and do everything I want to do as a trans person on their own in this tough world.  Any advice, especially from those that have gone through this would be helpful.  Thanks everyone."

ImElissa_WasGQTrans,asktransgender,Bye all :) No nothing bad.,"Just that I'm going to leave this sub behind me. Y'all have been a great support to get me on the rails but I'm leaving this sub to live my life as a trans woman surrounded by cis people.

What pulled the trigger on this sub was how a lot of trans women here think they made it and the rest of us are just guys. I can't take that mentality any longer . Yeah , I pass , my life is great ,... I'm everything of a woman. Every straight guy wants me because they have no clue that I'm trans , I'm the holy grail of passing ,... That mentality starts to irritate me. 
Because of those types I thought for a longggg time that I was not a real woman. Well , I am every bit of a woman.
Trannier-than-thou types are the toxic reason I don't feel comfortable anymore here. 
Let's face it : cis women don't act like they are the barbie who made it either , why should some trans women act like that then?
Solve the physical defect you were born with and respect people who are still in transition. Seams hard for some. I've seen post-op women here on this sub who move on with their lives and just give friendly advice to others . But lately the ''  I'm great , I'm post-transition , every hot guy wants me '' bragging types are so overpopulating this sub. 

Being a trans woman means living your life as a woman and stop bragging about how well you pass. It's almost like being trans is a '' show '' or '' a job '' for some ... It's not , it's a biological defect that once solved you put at rest . A pretty cis woman is not going to visit every sub either to say how pretty she is. The typical '' I'm girlier than you '' types here are toxic.

I think that a happy trans woman is a woman who lives her life as a cis woman and doesn't invalidate others.

I'm going to continue my transition surrounded by cis people , I'm done with the toxic trans community.

Thanks to the people who were normal and humble on this sub , to the rest : is being a barbie doll what you did it for? 

Again thanks to all the sweet people here , it's not for you , it's that the trans community can be a toxic place and no one wants to be in such a place.

To the ones pre-everything or just starting : the barbie doll types are not happy themselves. They are so toxic because they live from invalidating others . Having a personality and will power to succeed is all you need , not the trans barbie police bragging about how they pass better than you.


The key to luck is finding a life after and beside transsexuality. No matter how you look.
Remember : this is just one aspect of you , not your job .

It will be healthier for me to stay away from the trans barbies that visit this sub lately to put other people down. There are so many sweet people here but a few plastic '' I'm everything '' hons can kill your mood.

Hormones are already an emotional change ,you don't need a douchebag putting you down for '' not being trans enough or pretty enough '' .

Hugs and stay healthy .
I'll be fine

Dear Mom,

I’m still a girl. 

Remember when I came out to you over 7 years ago? And I was so worried about what you would think….I was so friggin worried that I was considering suicide instead….and you knew this. Maybe that’s why you hugged me and told me you’d love me and support me no matter what.

Because of course it was a lie. It only took a couple weeks and a christian counselor to convince you that you didn’t have to support me in my transition to womanhood. It didn’t seem to matter that I did finally attempt suicide either. 

I’m sure you remember the countless times you said I’d always be your son. Yet you begged me to somehow unfriend all of your friends from Facebook before I came out. Not at all unlike how you begged me not to have vaginoplasty surgery a couple years later. 

After years of christmas / birthday cards with my dead name on them, gender neutral gifts, and using my brother as a go-between, I said enough and told you not to contact me again until you accepted reality. 

Of course I broke that silence, unfortunately, reconnecting with Dad and he somehow convinced me to contact you again too. But in doing so, I opened myself up to more verbal abuse after asking nicely for you try to gender my correctly and use the correct name. Instead you threw it in my face and blamed the last few years of your suffering on me.

Is it sad that I somehow know if you were no longer in the picture (divorce or death), my father may at least want to see me again?…..but as long as you are in the picture, he does what you want.

Anyway it’s National Coming out Day again and you still refuse to acknowledge your daughter but you know what? I’m still here and I’m still a girl.

I have been getting really depressed lately everytime i see myself in the mirror, see another girl, or see posts on this sub about transition. I really really want to start hormones but my dad wont even talk to me about it and he wont take me to a real therapist. He took me to this guy who i thought would be fine because he recommended me to a really great therapist, but my dad wont take me to her and this guy doesn't want to talk about my transition, which is the most important thing in my life rn. His views on things also seem dated, he says that i can't be transgender as i didn't play with dolls as a kid (never mind the fact i never had access to those things) and apparently me trying to cut off a certain appendage ""isn't a sure indicator"". He seems to think that diagnosing people as transgender is just a phase and its overly diagnosed (i tried to tell him that i thought it was because people are realising it more and feel more comfortable transitioning as peopel become more accepting) .

abbxrdy,asktransgender,[MTF] Voice training question about larynx position: swallowing position vs highest falsetto,"Right now I'm only focusing on voice timbre. For two weeks I've been doing the trick where you swallow and try to hold the larynx up. With it up there, I try to produce tones with within my voice register. I haven't been hearing much of any difference, it's frustrating. 

My adam's apple is small enough that it's not really visible unless it's midway down or lower, so I can't really see what's going on. I'm trying to feel its position with my hands. I can't tell the difference between where the larynx is during a swallow verses where it is when it's positioned to produce my highest falsetto tone. I can fairly easily jam it up as I would for that falsetto tone and then sound out in my voice register and keep its position mostly up. On some of my recordings it sounds a little andro at best. 

Is there any difference in positon between swallowing and highest falsetto position? I keep reading that it should be tilting back, but I can't feel it tilting at all. I can tilt it forward when it's in a low position. 

For what it's worth, my average pitch is 110Hz. My voice register range is 80Hz to 320Hz (easily accessable range is 90Hz to 270Hz). Falsetto range is 180Hz to 700Hz (easily accessable range is 190Hz to 550)

For the recorder I'm using an olympus ws-803. It outputs to headphones while recording and I use apple ear pods. It's ridicousouly good, so much so that when I hear other people in the recordings it sounds exact and you can't tell that it's not them and is a recording, so I know what I sound like. I'm using a program called baudline on OS X to generate spectrographs and have a tone generator app on my phone that I use for pitch matching.

I had my one-year check-up on hormones (hurray milestones) and it got me thinking about how much has changed about me. Hormones have done a lot to my body and I've gotten my ears pierced, tried make-up, changed my hair, shaved a whole bunch, etc.

But I still totally don't pass. I've gotten gendered correctly by strangers, but only every once and a while, and it totally depends on what I'm wearing. But even though my family and friends have been good about pronouns for quite awhile, for whatever reason this week everybody just seems to have dropped the ball. My mom called me by the wrong name a buncha times, my friends kept using male pronouns, and I've gotten sir'd a buncha times in public.

Ally_Katt,asktransgender,Wife is struggling :(,"Warning: Long post!!! Lots of text!!!

A little info to fill you all in on our situation first: my wife and I met about two and a half years before I came out to her as trans. We were married about six months before I came out. I had first tried her about my cross dressing ""fetish"" and told her multiple times that that's all it was, just a security fetish...

Obviously we ask know how that turned out. I never would've married her without telling her I was trans if I knew it myself at the time. It's something I feel a lot of guilt over, but am learning to forgive myself for, given that I honestly didn't know who I was yet even though I thought I did. My chronic depression I had felt with over the past 6-8 years really muddied everything up and made coming to the ultimate conclusion of being a transgendered woman quite difficult. 

My wife is amazing, and the best person I've ever met. She loves me no matter what and had decided that me being trans doesn't change our marriage. I've made sure that she knows all I want is for her to be happy no matter what that means. In the past she's struggled with whether or not she can truly be happy being married to a woman. She is straight and has never been attracted to women, but she's said with me that wouldn't matter. The connection we have is what matters and there's plenty of ways for us to be sexually active together and share that intimacy together besides regular old fashioned heterosexual PIV sex. 

What she truly is struggling with is that she's worried she's going to get too far down the road and feel like she wasted a lot of time where she could've been finding someone else. She's worried she won't be happy once I've transitioned far enough. I'm still pre-HRT and only present every few days head to toe, so it's hard to tell whether or not she's going to be ok when I'm presenting every day and start to get far enough along with the results from HRT. 

Part of me thinks a lot of this is just doubts and fears, which I'm no stranger to, coming out. Another part of me worries I'm being selfish letting her stay with me, but I know how much she cares about me and how good we are for each other. It's a really difficult thing to sort through and find the best decision. The best solution I've come up with is, she'll be unhappy no matter what leaving me now, and she may end up being perfectly happy with how things are down the road. So there best thing to do is to wait and see. Given her fears of wasting time and feeling like missing out on being happy with her life, it really complicates things. 

Does anyone have any experience with similar situations? Any good advice?"

The nickname I chose is a logical derivative, and there is one male legendary figure with the name, so it was as close to unisex as I could get without feeling like I was inviting questions I wasn't ready to answer. For a general idea, think e.g. ""Stacy"" from ""Anastasia"". I looked into other possibilities for names, but never felt a particular connection to anything.

I legally changed it about a year ago, in part because I got married in January and really didn't want my birth name on my marriage license, and in part because my birthname was causing me enough distress anyway that I figured it was about time. I've just finished changing over my SS card, DL, credit cards, bank account, employer records, student loans and other FAFSA stuff, current school records, health &amp; auto insurance, etc. (I know, I know, but bureaucracy and paperwork give me anxiety, and if there's anything I have a talent for it's procrastination.) So most of my dysphoria from being deadnamed all the time is alleviated. 

But! A few days ago, I was idly looking through SSA records of names that were popular the year I was born, and while I was dismissing most of the ones that read unisex to me as sounding like suburban douchebags, ""Cameron"" stood out and is still sticking with me. I think I like it because it feels age-appropriate, the rhythm is similar to my birthname in a way that makes it feel familiar and like it could easily belong to me, but it's pretty inarguably unisex (I'm thinking of Cameron Esposito, Cameron Mitchell the SG-1 character, etc etc). Also it sounds great with my middle &amp; last names, and if I ever decide I want to take my wife's name it sounds great with that too. 

My current plan is to give it maybe a month or two to see if I still like it before I start asking RL friends to call me the new name, and give that at least a couple of years before I legally change it. Still, I feel kind of silly and like I made an impulsive decision the first time around because of this, even though I know rationally that's not true, and I don't regret changing it. I think it's entirely possible that the reason I'm even having these feelings now is that no longer having to deal with my birthname in any significant way means I feel safe enough to even consider whether I *like* my chosen name. 

Has anyone else gone through a similar process? If you've started using the second name, how did you handle asking friends/family/coworkers to use the new name for you, and how did it go? Have you legally changed to the second name? How long did you wait between name changes? Did anyone official give you guff for changing your name twice?"
suchsmallhands123,asktransgender,Coming out as NB(kinda) to a therapist?,"Hey all,
I've been wrestling with the idea of being non-binary for a couple months, and I'm feeling a bit of guilt for it. Namely, I'm a cis male who wants to stay a cis male, but I still want to get on some sort of HRT regimen in order to present as more androgynous (it's odd to me, for instance, that other guys are frightened by infertility and grown breast tissue, for instance). I have two issues with my feelings here: first, I feel like I don't ""deserve"" hrt due to not being trans enough (I get that yeah, NB and genderqueer people exist and have gotten on hrt before, but do I even qualify as that?), and second, this all feels so fanciful: it's the kind of thing that I, a poor uni student with a middle class single mother supporting me, should ignore for the sake of our well being as a family, as taking girlpills for a prolonged period of time will be incredibly draining to our resources--especially because NB-ism would me much harder for me to justify to my mom. 


So anyways, rant aside, I have a therapist, and I want to bring this stuff up to her in order to talk it over with someone, but I'm not sure how to introduce it to her--I'm not even sure if she'll understand what it is I'm trying to achieve. What should I do?"
MaddieB1111,asktransgender,For those who doubt and fear. Go on now and live. You are free.,"I wanted to provide some simple advice to help some people change their perspective. Some may think that this just isnt so. They will say ""No no no, it's not that simple."" However, my dear, i can assure you that it most certainly is this simple. Personally i have experienced so much doubt in who i am and in what i am doing. I have felt so much fear in the future and outcome of my decisions. As people, we are always looking to be validated. Specifically as Transgender people, this seems to be so very important. We look to others to tell us who we are. We want to know that we are doing the right thing. We may come to this very thread and look for someone to relate to or to have someone tell us that we are probably this and that. We look to have our feelings and identies validated. The thing is that the only one who can validate who we are is ourselves because we know ourselves better than anyone else. We make who we are. We manifest what we think about. Now i would like to share my experience over the last couple days.  I met a very kind man and we instantly connected on a spiritual level. We sat in his car and talked for hours about life and our beliefs. It was inevitable that we came to the topic of my transgender identity. Not in the way of what it means to be transgender but more simply, what i want. Who and where i want to be. He asked me, ""why are you anxious."" I paused for a few seconds and stared out the passenger side window then turned to him and replied,""I'm afraid."" He then asked,""what are you afraid of?"" I answered,""I'm afraid of being wrong. I'm afraid of getting to the end and not finding what I'm looking for."" The man's response to that was simple and clear,""Stop thinking that you're not. Don't think that you're not because you are."" He then followed up,""Let me ask you something. When you do your makeup and slip into your favorite dress and put on your cute little high heels, how do you feel?"" I paused and thought for a second, turned to him with a smile, and responded,""Better."" He smiled and leaned in a little with his eybrows raised and said,""well there you go."" In that moment, i understood that things are so very simple. Alot of us doubt ourselves and ask things like,""What if im not really a girl/boy inside?What if im not really Transgender?"" Or we ask Why things are the way they are or wish things were different. The truth is that none of these things really matter. The one simple thing thats important is what you want or what you wish for. The saying,""Be careful what you wish for"" is NOT there to inspire fear or doubts in your wishes. It means that what we ask for, we will receive. As i sit here and look at my changing body, my maturing breasts, my softening features I think,"" This is exactly what i asked for. This is exactly what i wanted."" I set my mind to doing it and so it is happening. A common phrase spoken by the man that i encountered was this: ""You can only focus on one thing at a time. Don't waste it."" It took me a little time go figure out what this means but now i know. We choose if we want to focus on the  negative or the positive. If we put all our focus on our Misery well then guess what....we will be Miserable. On the other hand if we set our mind to be happy well then we will find happiness by doing the things that make us happy. Manifest your world through your mind. Manifest love and happiness. Love  yourself because all the love you need is inside you. No one can ever love us like we love ourselves. Love yourself and you will attract love from other people. I could go on but its time to cut it short. This is only a moment in time, love, so trust your experience and trust yourself. You are limitless and you have no bounds. Be who you want to be. Live how you want to live. You are free. I hope this can help someone like it has helped me. I am awake now. You can only focus on one thing at a time....so don't waste it. &lt;3"

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,What kind of mindset should I have when talking to a therapist?,"Okay, so I had a somewhat more serious discussion with my Dad, and he's totally cool and open to everything. He said that he knows that people Are different and some people are transgender and born that way.

But he made the point that I shouldn't jump to labels and that we should explore every avenue. Basically not just going to therapy day 1 being like "" I'm transgender, don't tell me otherwise, I dont need to talk I just need hormones"".

And that's extremely reasonable. There could many different explanations for why I feel the way I feel, low testosterone, underlying mental illness, social anxiety, etc.   

Part of me hopes that that isn't the case and that I'm really trans so I get to be a woman, but having it be something less extreme would be fine. Im probably textbook trans, but a professional opinion is good to have.

I'm going to the doctors on Thursday and getting a referral for a therapist, so it's still a decent ways away, but, for those who went into therapy:

What kind of mindset did you go into it with? Did you go in there absolutely believing one hundred percent that you were trans, or took a more neutral and less linear stance and had your therapist help you come to the conclusion that you were trans and that you wanted transition?"

QuestioningMtF1,asktransgender,Women get aroused by their own bodies?,"After seeing the study by Moser that ""93% of women would have AGP"" and hearing the arguments against it I am beginning to side with the conclusion that Moser came to. After thinking about it, it seems women enjoy, get turned on, or both, by flaunting their bodies. This is obvious by the way many women exhibit their bodies with clothing, on ""cam sites"", porn videos, music videos, etc. It is to an extent that far exceeds that of men. I cant really think of any good examples of a comparable situation for men. Why would this be only for women? Does this prove that women get turned on by their bodies, or at least feeling sexy?"

throwitawayfast1,asktransgender,My dad's stuck on gender theory...,"x-post r/ftm

So I came out to my parents about a year ago, and we've been attending regular therapy for the last couple of months, and we just recently had a group session. I'm 14 and in 8th grade and really desperate to transition, so this meeting was important to me to see if I could get my parents on the same page as I am.

Anyway, in the group session, I realized that he'd never really gotten past the idea of gender as a social construct. I posted about this a few months ago and I was told to tell him about the John/Joan case which proved that there's an inherent feeling of gender, but bottom line-- he doesn't listen and says he doesn't personally feel male, just male in his relationship to society.

Because of this, he believes that no one doctor can test me, however thoroughly, and ""prove"" that I'm trans.

How do I respond to him?"

Untucking was absolutely easy and not painful at all. However now, a few hours after untucking I'm feeling a very mild pain right were my testes were (inguinal canals), especially on my left side (where I have a varicocele).

I was wondering if this is normal? It is very bearable and not even that bothering I just wanted to know if it can happen the first times.

AnarchyFox,asktransgender,I want to go forward but feel held back...,"It's been over a year since the train wreck that was me realising I was questioning my gender hit me. Over that time I've have dabbled presenting as female around a few choice friends while staying firmly in the closet and it's killing me. I'm depressed and anxious to all hell alongside it all.

I want to be called my other name without having to go through a hour long routine to get ready, which inly lines up on certain days its viable. But I cant honestly expect my friends to do that when I feel like I'm not even making an effort. I want to feel okay about myself and I'm so goddamn sick of dysphoria. I hate that I'm still questioning myself, even though at times it seems so obvious and I'm scared half to death that it's all in my head and I'm fucked up.

I know I want HRT because I know it will help me be female and I've looked into Dr Webberlys private service and they've been really nice and I've got to the point where I only have to pay, but I'm scared about my funds. I need money for university, I want more clothes because what I have is so little...

I'm scared about my parents knowing, I half came out to my mother and she seems so disproving, I don't want to disappoint my parents and I don't want them to hate me. They're such loving parents, and I know I'm reserved around them, I always have been I just want their support...

I hate this its so frustrating and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'll never be anything and every day is me wasting away, just stuck hating myself while I push forward with my studies and what I want to do for a career, not how I personally feel about myself..."
[deleted],asktransgender,Started getting male fail and it's bothering me. I'm starting to miss being male.,"So I mentioned in a previous post  about not feeling trans or feeling the need to transition anymore.  But lately, I've started to miss just being a masculine male and had days where I felt my previous male aggression returning.  I used to be pretty masculine and fought competitively but completely stopped doing any type of upper body workouts and fight training in an attempt to lose some muscle mass.


Now, I'm getting male fail (I only present male) quite a bit and it's bothering me.  I know I should be happy but I just feel so emasculated and weak, I hate it.   I really really don't want to detransition but when I look in the mirror, I don't see a woman, or a trans femme person, I see a really weak version of my previous self.  I've had my hormone levels checked recently and they were good so I don't think it's that.  I have an appointment with my therapist in about 3 weeks but I just don't know anymore, the doubts are so damn confusing.  Is it just me or has anyone else gone through something like this?  "

Lately, there seems to be some other strong feelings for the same sex. Whenever I see the naked body of a well built, bulky male I can't help but have an almost overpowering feeling of what might be considered lust. I'm not attracted to men's faces per se....it's just that when I see a muscular, man naked...there are very strong feelings there that might be sexual in nature...possible even stronger than that toward women. Whenever I fantasize about sex with men, it is with a female body. The orgasms are many times stronger...as if this is how things are supposed to be. I don't get turned on just by imagining myself as a woman ...it is only more of an intense connection fantasizing as a woman during sex with a man.(I've tried crossdressing and it doesn't turn me on at all. I do somewhat enjoy it though.) My feelings just seem very primal in nature, I guess. I don't know any open transgender women and I'm trying to get a better understanding of what is going on...so I figured I'd ask."
NeedSome_Answers,asktransgender,"When you first thought that you might be transgender, did you become obsessed with the idea?","Alright, on Thursday morning of this week I decided to visit this sub. I don't really know why I did, but for some reason I did. After reading thou so of the posts here I really started to relate to them. I mostly tried not to think about it and I went to school like normal. The problem is that the only thing I could think of is the possibility that I might be trans. When I got home I was still thinking about it and decided to post here about it. I was so obsessed with the idea that I couldn't really think about anything else. I ended up not going to school Friday because of this. Well now it is Saturday morning and I still just can't stop thinking about it. My brain feels like a broken record, with the same thoughts playing over and over again.

Immediately (against my doctors orders), I went up to 6 mg of estrogen to get my levels back in shape. I feel like they're doing fine but I'm still a bit scared. I never grew facial hair or became hairy or anything so the fact that I can potentially regress into a male scares me beyond belief. 

Has anyone had an orchiectomy in Southern California? Shit, any part of California is fine at this point. I just want these f*ckers gone. Also, pricing would be nice too. I'm a broke college student from a non-affluent family, so this would be entirely out of pocket."

So, I've really been wondering if i'm trans or not in the past few days, and I've been lurking here looking to see if I can relate to anyone here. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this all day, I probably haven't gone a full 5 minutes without thinking about it today. This started about a year or two ago, where I was getting these kind of thoughts a lot. I just waved them off as intrusive thoughts and ignored them, and they kind of just went to the back of my mind but they never really went away. Today I have pretty much spent the entire day debating with myself if I'm trans or not, and I have been able to relate to a lot of what the people here are saying but then again there are a lot of things here that I can't relate to. For example, always being a little feminine. I have long hair (it goes down about 2 inches past my shoulders but it is very curly so it is longer than it looks) and have never done any really manly things. But than again there are a lot of things here that I can't relate to. For example when people are wondering if they are trans, they wish that they aren't trans. I have no problem with being trans and if I am it would make a lot of sense, but the only reason I'm worried is that I don't want to make a mistake. I don't want to end up blaming all my problems on the fact that I'm trans and thinking that everything will be better after I transition, then being disappointed that it turns out that my problems were based on something else. Another thing is that I've never really cared about which gender I am. For years I always thought that I woke up as a girl one day I wouldn't mind. I still can decide if that is because I want to be female or if it is just the fact that I don't really care. I don't know.

Thanks for reading this, I don't know if I've already made up my mind and I'm just looking for others to make my decision for me or not. But thanks anyways.     "

Private treatment of GID is illegal here, it can only be treated at a single state hospital in the country. I got my general practitioner to refer me there for treatment, waited 1 month, then received a letter saying I need to go to the district psychiatry center first. I got my GP to refer me there, waited 1 month again, and now I just received a letter saying my condition isn't serious enough for me to be entitled to receive therapy there, and that I should instead contact my local health authority for teenagers.

Dannyboyy1993,asktransgender,Started speaking to my dad again - FtM,"Hello, first post here. I'm a post op gay transman and wanted to share a positive story about my reconciliation with my dad. 

I came out to my family 4 years ago in my late teens and had a very negative reaction from my parents. My mum was very angry (understatement) while my dad couldn't even look at me. I told them I'm transitioning whether they supported me or not. My mum told me that she never wants to see me again and quite literally threw me out the door. Luckily I had a really supportive older brother who took me in and even helped me with some of the financial side of my transition. 4 years later and I've (nearly) completed my transition and live fully as a man. I have a really supportive boyfriend of 2 years and I'm more happy than I've ever been before. 

But to the point of my post, a few weeks back my brother invited me to catch a beer with him and my dad. I haven't spoken to my dad since I've came out but my brother has been trying to fix things between us so I did it for him. When I actually saw my dad thing got really emotional, he called me Danny, gave me a hug, said I looked handsome and that I got his beard haha. We spoke about everything, he apologised a lot and we both cried. He asked a lot of questions about me and my surgery, he said he's been doing a ton of reading on the subject. I still hold a little resentment for kicking me out and missing out on 4 years of my life when I needed him most and I know deep down he probably isn't as comfortable with this as he's portraying but he's really trying and that's all I ever wanted. 

Since then, we've actually been talking a lot. I thought it'd be awkward but it's been really good. Even the little things like being called Danny in his phone makes me really happy. I truly feel I've got my dad back although it will take a long time to fully rebuild our relationship. He's meeting my boyfriend on Saturday which I'm nervous for (though strangely he used to work with my boyfriends uncle so that's something). My mum is probably never going to come around although my dad said he's working on it. We shall see but right now I'm in a good place with a brilliant boyfriend, awesome brother, supportive father and a body which I love.

shininasai,asktransgender,"We ask ourselves: do you want to transition. But, do we really have a choice?","I don't think so. I'll explain, and I am feeling very unhappy about this, but I think this is probably true, as you'll see below.

If you have lost nothing precious for transitioning, like your wife/husband/kids/father/mother/career/dreams/health/friends/family/wealth/younameit, you're lucky, very very lucky. For some, it is like losing many many things just to say yes to transition. For me, yes, I lost something in the list.

We have essentially a question to answer for ourselves: Do I want to transition?
1) Yes
2) No.
Here's the thing. If I say yes, then I lost many things - and maybe gain some, not sure, but the losses are clearly seen, the future not. If I say no, we all know that, we **will** want to transition again, so we come back to the question just at a later age, repeating and repeating.

So, essentially, we have no choice, because answering no means you'll have to answer the question once again **until one day you answer yes**, it's just like a repeating hell!

Don't you think so? Think about it, did you have a choice? If yes, why do you think so? Help me, I need to find a way to convince myself that I really did make a choice I like out of free-will?"

GalaxySpacecats,asktransgender,Looking for a transgender support group?,"I've tried susans place and it didn't work out they're very aggressive with me and overly controlling i like my space and freedom i like peace and support and not a place where i feel confined and scared to speak my mind about my own transition and be who i am.

BreezyyBreee,asktransgender,Question for post-FFS patients,"So I'm a 21 y/o trans girl that recently had FFS with Dr. Deschamps-Braly in San Francisco, and given I'm only a month into recovery, I've had very little if any bruising at all, and my healing seems to be speedier than most stories I've heard, but I'm still a bit curious about recovery times. Mind you, I had the surgeon perform the works (forehead reconstruction, rhinoplasty, chin, etc.) so I didn't skimp out on anything, but I still can't seem to look in the mirror or take a selfie and be satisfied with what I see. I understand it can take months to see a final product, but with a new face I have no guidance on what the severity of my swelling is relative to my final look, so naturally I freak the hell out. My question to you is, how long did it take for you to see or have an idea of your final product? How long did it take for you to stop panicking in mirrors or pictures? "

AilurusTristis,asktransgender,I can't improve and don't know how to,"I'm sorry to clog this place up with such a downer story, but I really just need to rant. Maybe some of you will relate and be able to give me... something to help.

I've known I was trans for at least 5 years and had a general idea of it for much longer. While I've managed to hide it really well putting up with this for so long has just utterly destroyed my life. I've been riddled with anxiety and depression for so long I'm not even sure if I can remember what it feels like to be consistently happy or confident. I've never even been brave enough to apply for a job, let alone get one, and I just barely managed to scrape through University with a crappy degree in a field I hate and should never have picked. I've never really had any close relationships and feel more distant from other people every day. I don't do anything with my life and every time I try and change that I get shot down within a couple of days. Nothing interests or inspires me any more, I feel like I don't even know who I really am deep down. So much time under the effects of testosterone and male social pressure have turned me into something I hate and that's so resistant to any kind of change that I don't know if I can ever be what I want to be.

I came out to my immediate family and the closest people I have to friends within the last three months or so. I told them I was MTF and attracted only to women, which is kind of a lie. I'm bi and don't know what my actual identity is, other than it leaning on the feminine side. I hope that while going along with HRT I can find the area that suits me and make it easier on them to understand and accept it. I get the impression that they're creeped out or ashamed of me but I guess I should be glad that they're not throwing me out of their lives from the get go. None of them have really shown any active interest in helping me, and while I don't think they intend to do it my parents are making life hard on me by refusing to respect who I am and not shifting their attitude towards me beyond their usual expectations of me as their ""son"". I've hidden my problems and self-destructive behaviour so well that I don't think they really take me seriously, or just think I'm making excuses for being lazy or trying to be trendy or something.

Anyway, I got access to HRT well beyond what I can reasonably afford in the long term a few weeks ago. I'll probably be able to get HRT and facial hair removal that I can actually afford on my country's healthcare system in the future but long waiting times mean I have to put up with what little I can get now. I haven't felt a single effect yet and I know I just need to give it time to build up, but I don't think it's going to be enough to help me. I've been down the medicine route before with multiple antidepressants and all they gave me were more thoughts of suicide and nasty withdrawal symptoms when I couldn't bring myself to visit a doctor to ask for new prescriptions. This resistance to change and sensitivity to other people's judgement is just so ingrained in me. Ideally I'd like to be able to get out of my family's house to a less toxic environment but obviously I have no source of income and nobody else that would be willing to live with me. I want to be able to take the first steps towards not having to look and act like a man but the judgement and criticism every time I even try to do something different pushes me back down again every time. I can't even look at myself or hear myself speak without feeling awful, how am I supposed to change myself in this state? Even picking a name's been impossible for me. I threw a feminine name that I like out for my family to use for me (they don't, of course) but hearing it ever used in relation to me just feels unnatural and I don't want to spend the rest of my life going by it.

I wish I could be more specific about what the issue is here instead of just some vague sob story, but not being able to figure out exactly what's wrong beyond gender dysphoria is part of the problem. I guess I just... feel like I don't know how to function like a person. I can't communicate with other people, can't engage in things, can't be passionate about anything, can't even get myself out of bed in the morning without putting it off for hours. Actually transitioning feels like such a Herculean task that I'm not up to at all and even if HRT performs miracles I don't know how I'd be able to adjust to living the life I've always wanted without just immediately slipping back into this vicious cycle. I know there's no shame in not being like other people but I feel like I'm completely lacking in the knowledge and drive to actually function as an independent person. Does this sound familiar to anyone here? I feel like I've never actually experienced what it's like to be actually happy, comfortable or productive and need a thousand different positive changes to happen to me all at once or nothing will change for the better."
testacc2075,asktransgender,How to dose my HRT?,"Hello all. I started HRT today but I've forgotten how I was told to dose!

I'm supposed to take a 2 of my 2mg estrogen pills under my tongue a day. I assume ill do this when I wake up and before I sleep. I also have Spiro. 25mg tablets. It says to take one tablet by mouth twice daily. 

Is this right? I feel like maybe I should be dosing the estrogen all at once and the Spiro twice a day.  Basically I'm wondering how to properly dose 4mg estrogen and 50mg Spiro each day. 

Thanks."
shpew12,asktransgender,How do I help my family identify me correctly?,"I'm a trans guy and I just came out to my family last night. They asked me my name and so I told them my preferred name and pronouns as well as some other discussion, so I thought was pretty lucky to have an understanding family and that everything went rather well.

BUT THEN when my family started talking to me after they exclusively were using my old name and pronouns.

I don't understand how such a massive misunderstanding could have occurred.
Are they waiting for me to say ok you can start calling me my name now?
Or maybe no one wanted to be the first person to use my name?
Am I just being impatient?

I don't know what to do."
RockerBoyGirl,asktransgender,Am I really genderfluid?,"I've identified throughout my questioning as genderfluid for awhile now. I've identified this way due to having an equal desire to be both a guy and a girl. Yet gender fluidity seems to be different, where people often describe feeling male one day and female the next. I've considered bigender but I've also heard that's due to an involuntary flip, so different from my situation. What would describe me?"
geminifading,asktransgender,"Two laser sessions on face without any shed, normal?","I'm two sessions into laser with my last one being 16 days ago at this point. So far I haven't experienced any kind of shed from either session where I've noticed a large amount of hairs falling out. Sounds like most people treat that as a sign that laser is actually working. My facial hair doesn't look too noticeably different. I mostly have thick hair on upper lip, chin and neck with only a few random hairs elsewhere. Don't see any noticeable bald patches where it's thick.

I have pale skin with black hair so it sounds like I should be a good candidate for laser. The place I'm going to is using either an Alma Soprano Ice or XL, can't remember which one, if anyone has experience with those. Is it normal not to see any shedding/thinning at this point?"
Neosquid,asktransgender,Questions about orchiectomy?,"I've been thinking about it a lot and I'm really not sure if I want to get SRS. The concept of the surgery itself still bothers me, and it's so much money. My, umm, ""secret tentacle"" doesn't cause me huge amounts of dysphoria and I think I'd be okay with keeping it, my balls are the bigger issue. They're a hideous 200-foot wide mass of concentrated bullshit that make my panties bulge heavily, which isn't a gigantic problem right now but will be whenever I start wearing skirts and especially bikinis. 

So I'm thinking I want to get an orchiectomy this year. I know it could potentially interfere with SRS if I decide to get that sometime down the line, but that's not a big concern for me, it wouldn't be for years anyway. I just want to be able to wear skirts and bikinis without worrying about such a large bulge, plus it would help speed up HRT. It seems that insurance will cover it 100% this year as thanks to my dad's recent surgical shenanigans, we've met the family deductible. They said they only cover procedure code 54520, which as far as I understand is the more simple version of the surgery which involves the removal of the testicles but the scrotum is left intact.

So basically I just have a few questions for anyone who's had this surgery done. Like, as far as wearing swimsuits goes, how noticeable/manageable is the bulge? How did it help with your hormone therapy? Does the scrotum, like, shrink up against your crotch when there's nothing left in it, or do you still have an annoyingly textured mass of flesh hanging down there? Any other comments you think are noteworthy? I'm obviously going to talk to the doctor about it before actually getting the surgery done, but I felt that I should ask here too. Honestly, sometimes I forget this subforum (and reddit in general) exists. I should come on here more often, I think being around other trans people helps me maintain whatever's left of my sanity. "
CosmicMina,asktransgender,Breast growth?,"Hi,

So I hit three weeks today. I'm on 10mg of estrodiol Injection and 50 mg of cyproterone acetate. 

Anyway, my boobs have started to grow much more than I expected. I'm not complaining, but I am curious. Does growth come in waves or does it happen all at once slowly and steadily. Some days they really hurt and others the don't hurt. It seems my nipples always hurt if they are touched.

Thanks.

haremenot,asktransgender,Gatekeeping with informed consent?,"My boyfriend and I (both of us are trans), went to the same doctor to get on hormones. He is widely respected as the best doctor in our area for trans issues and seemed like the obvious choice, so we went to him. 

He required both of us to visit a therapist to get things ""worked out"" before he will prescribe T. My boyfriend listed some past trauma and struggles with depression on his form, so that was the doctor's reason for him to go to a therapist. I only listed anxiety, and the reason he told me I needed to go to the therapist was bc I got a little emotional when discussing my gender as a kid, and he didn't want those emotions to come ""boiling up"" when I start T.

I understand he's trying to cover his ass, but what is the point of informed consent if we are still required to get approval from a therapist? Has anyone else experienced this trying to get IC?

(For the record, I'm 30, have been out about being trans socially for 5~ years now. I'm not a teenager or someone who is still weighing their options. I just want to start T ._.)"
KiwiInABox,asktransgender,Uhm.. I got a question..,"I'm a 19yr old guy.... Or am I? 

Hi, i'm living in Bavaria, Germany and things here aren't easy almost nobody accept transgenders or homosexual people. 
I wanted to be a female for very long and when i was sixteen, i started to dress up like one. I felt great.. For a moment.  but people gave me looks, talked bad behind my back, i felt under pressure and nobody helped or understood me. At this time i had fights with my parents cause they thought i'd be crazy or makimg shit up. I went to a psycho doc, after i tried to kill myself. She didn't helped me with the whole gender issue but instead tried to fix my depression (which was caused by my gender issue) so time went on and i just stopped i got medics against my depression and tried to fit in. I did not want to go trough all of it again.. 
I still want to be a female but the pressure all this influence, critiques and mistreatment is just to much. The desire to finally become a woman grows stronger and so does my fear of getting thrown back in the same situation... What should i do?"
Siapran,asktransgender,Should I worry about my estradiol levels being too high?,"Ok so I started HRT about three months ago. The doc prescribed me some progesterone (200 mg/d oral) and some estradiol (2.5 g/d transdermal gel, 0.06%).

Before HRT, my levels were: 20.6 nmol/l testosterone and 15.5 ng/l estradiol (my estradiol levels were WAY below normal male range).

Right now the levels are: 8.18 nmol/l testosterone and 1064 ng/l estradiol (my estradiol levels are now WAY above normal female range).

I haven't experienced any documented symptoms of high estradiol levels. My breasts have grown quite a lot in the meantime, and they're starting to feel slightly painful when they're being touched.

So yeah, idk."
grekhaus,asktransgender,What can/should I do about all of the self-hate in this sub?,"/r/asktransgender is what originally got me to sign up on reddit. But lately it's just been filled with depressed people spewing hate and threatening to kill themselves. I don't want to call anyone in particular out, so here's some paraphrased examples that shouldn't be taken to be about any particular person:

""How do you deal with the fact that you're never going to pass and always be an ugly freak?""
""I'm just a waste of space, ignore me.""
""Welp, time to kill myself.""
""I'm never going to pass, so I'm going to stop trying to fool myself. I'm never going to be a real girl.""
""Its too late for me, 14 is too old to transition, I'll just be a freak.""

I absolutely hate seeing that sort of content, as it makes everyone (the posters included) miserable, but I feel guilty if I go to downvote it because then I'm effectively telling suicidal people to fuck off. But sometimes I do it anyways, just as a 'please stop posting this' message. Is this selfish of me? Should I stop reading this sub? Is is OK to downvote those people?"
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,"My housemate is cool, but apparently he's also a bigot?","Maybe bigot is too strong word for that, but I outed myself by an accident. He said that he understands and it's cool.

But... he still refers to me as male, plus says things like ""I wish that some **real** girl would move it"". So he implied that I'm not a girl, more, I'm not even real. 

Maybe I'm overthinking stuff, but I'm really mad about it. I know that I'm only 5 months on HRT, so I look androgynous, but still if he understands it, why he does it? I don't know if I even want to know anymore."
mid-brow_undertones,asktransgender,"MTF? Could use some advice. Is the time right to look into this, or should I wait?","I'm an individual with a lot of insecurities, my gender being only one of them.  I guess my biggest question is... can I succeed?  Will this work for me or is this something out of reach or best left to a future where I can handle the struggle?  I have a rather serious anxiety disorder which keeps me from interacting with people in general and my various fears lead to avoidance and running in the opposite direction whenever an opportunity to start a serious relationship presented itself.  That being said, I deeply need to be loved and my greatest fear of all is being alone.  I feel like if I go through with this and transition into some 6'2 monster woman, I'm going to have even a harder time trying to find someone who's right for me, or even friends.  Or maybe it will give me the confidence I lack?  I don't know...

I also have to think about how it interacts with all the various other problems in my life.  I'm currently 25 and have a college degree, but I moved in with my parents after I graduated due to my anxiety and depression.  I feel like it might be a greater challenge getting a job or perhaps maintaining one if I'm a trans woman.  But yet I hear about how it's harder to accomplish breast and bone growth if I start hormones much later than right now.  But I also heard about some sort of psychological evaluation?  I'm not sure what it entails, but it seems likely that I could fail it at the moment....

I can tell you for certain that I am not comfortable being identified solely as male.  My room has like a hundred stuffed animals (though maybe I chalk that one up to being a kid at heart), I watch and read endless amounts of romance movies and books, and I have had some form of dysphoria since as long as I can remember.  I dream and fantasize of being the opposite gender, my heroes are female, I often look like a stranger in the mirror, etc.  I even already have a name picked out.  Maybe I'm gender fluid though, I don't know.

TLDR (though I would hope you read it!):  Do I try to develop my career and combat my antisocial tendencies first or should I really be focusing on my gender identity?"
anonopx,asktransgender,Passing as male or female?,I wonder if it is possible to pass as either one. There are times I want to be a girl but a guy at other times. Is that possible for everyone?
apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,How does someone in my position get on HRT?,"I'm 21. I just got fired from my first 'real' job, after half a month. (Long story.) This means I have no health insurance of my own and am stuck back on my parents' health insurance. However, I'm not out to my parents, and if I were to go to the informed consent clinic downtown and bill the visit to their insurance, the insurance would indirectly out me to my parents: my dad will see an unfamiliar charge on the insurance, look it up, and see that the clinic caters only to trans/gay people. That will lead to a lot of really awkward questions.

I need HRT, desperately. I'm extremely sick to my stomach from envy every time i see a trans timeline and I hate my male body. But I also don't want to come out to my parents, directly or indirectly. What do I do to get HRT? Self-med? Hope my parents won't notice the insurance charge?

Help."
Ianach,asktransgender,"Should I, Shouldn't I? My brain is fucked atm.","I don't know how to make this short but I will try.

About a year ago, after a few psychiatric assessments and finally getting the go ahead from a gate keeper I began my ''transition''. 

I started on hormones / T blockers which was going really well a few months in and I was already seeing results, then what I thought was the ''realistic'' thoughts kicked in. 

I asked myself questions like? Would I REALLY be unhappy as a man, the answer to which was I wouldn't be sad but I wouldn't be as happy if I was a woman, which my mind came to the conclusion meant wasn't enough to go ahead and transition. 

I also came up with the idea that I might be Gay, which im not, and I should try living as a Gay man, I had thoughts like ''being a woman would be good physically while you are young, but when you get older you will wish you stayed as a man'' and of course the self doubt thoughts such as '' You are nearly 6ft, built like a large man and will just end up not being able to have kids, being ugly and not being passable as a woman''.

This on top of the difficult battle transitioning involves made me suddenly stop my HRT, I also changed my name / gender back to male and have been living as male again the last few months. 

Today, or just now I got whacked by Dysphoria and dug out my old supply of HRT stuff, Staring at it for 10 minutes or so thinking, should I, shouldnt I? 

To me the reasons too are:

- I want to be a woman / I feel more like a girl than a guy
- I want to experience being in a relationship as a woman
- I dont feel like a man, or at least the stereotypical man, exploring my sexuality Im not gay so that isn't the reason for these feelings
- I have felt this way since being young

Cons :

- A long uphill battle
- I can cope with being a man, somewhat
- Will transitioning really fix my issues?
- Will I get to 40 and deeply regret transitioning? 
- Not being able to have kids (dont really care about that_
- Going through everything and not passing
- Losing my dick (that isnt a joke or a troll comment btw). 

Thoughts? "
areallyterribleidea,asktransgender,Why the lack of older non-binaries?,"Over the past couple of years, non-binary has sprung up as a mainstream gender.  I'd accept this unquestioningly were it not for the fact that it's a gender category seemingly existing only in teens and those in their early twenties.  There's very few NBs aged 40, 50, or older, when surely you'd expect a similar proportion across all age groups?  Older people appear to largely be ""old school"" transgender and want to transition from AMAB to F, or AFAB to M, rather than from AMAB to ""feminine sometimes"" or ""a little bit more feminine but no hormones or surgery"", or vice versa for the AFAB folks.

Why the lack of older NB individuals?  The cynic in me wonders if many NB people are either in denial that they're ""old school"" transgender and are coming out as NB as a means of testing the waters, or they're young people temporarily jumping on the newly-cool trans bandwagon without actually having to (or wanting to) transition.  A form of expression rather than an actual underlying medical condition.

Which is fine.  But does tend to give the impression that NB is the latest cool thing for teens to come out as.  The goths of the 201Xs?

This comes from a conversation I had with my psych recently, who mentioned that he's overrun with countless new referrals from NB teens while MtF or FtM referrals have remained steadily increasing in numbers after I mentioned that my local trans support group has doubled in size over the past year almost entirely from new young NB members, few of whom actually want to take any medical steps towards transitioning at all when pressed.  My psych maintains that in the NB group, he's having his work cut out sorting through those who are trans (including genuine NB) and those who are simply teenagers who see NB as a tool to stand out and be unique and special.

Thoughts on this?  Without flipping out?"
MaxineLevine,asktransgender,Stuck and anxious,"So I'm a college student with no job, and should I ever get on HRT, I would need my parents to fund it. Besides this, I commute to school, so it would be near impossible to hide it.  (It's hard enough hiding that I shave and dress up sometimes).

Basically, I can't start HRT until I come out to my parents, but there's already a lot going on at home and I don't want to complicate things."
Dcfan7738,asktransgender,When did you get to the point that you don't care what others think?,"Even when I was in denial, I was always to some degree concerned with what people thought even with non trans related stuff.  That being said, I think I am getting to the point to just say screw it and ""spill the beans"". I don't find it necessary to come out on facebook although I may eventually do that, but my main priorities is family and work although work would take more time.

What was your tipping point?  And once you did that did you start living as your true-self full time prior to hrt or at least part time outside of work?

I guess my tipping point other than starting to come to terms with myself is that my family seems to get smaller and smaller.  In the past few years I've lost 3 close family members, the most recent just a month ago, a young man who left this world way too early.  I feel like a fraud for putting on an act and not letting them know the real me."
Nicky21jr,asktransgender,MTF: I am extremely confused as to what/who I am,"Ever since I was about 5 years old I knew something was different about me. I could never find myself enjoying being a boy. Because I had a very abusive step dad I never told my parents about this, as I knew it would lead me to get beaten at home.

Fast forward 20 years, I am now 25 years old and been into bodybuilding for 5 years, including the use of steroids. I think this is a way for me to compensate being a girl on the inside, while presenting to the outside world as a very manly guy. I have a very small, feminine frame, but obviously the amount of muscle I have gained makes up for this. I am about 200 lbs 8% bodyfat right now, most guys would probably kill for the body I have, but I am disgusted by it daily.

The last couple of months I've been struggling so much with my feelings about being trans, according to my therapist it's obvious that I am transgender, but I've never told anyone in my life (except my therapist) about this.

It feels as if I'm so far down the road of being a guy, and being seen as very manly, there is no way back. I mean, how am I going to tell my parents or my girlfriend that I want to be a girl, when everyone views me as the most manly guy they know? 

My steroid abuse has come to the point where I take insane risks in the hope of ever convincing my mind that I am a guy, even though I realistically know this will never happen. If I keep going down this path I know I will not grow very old..

Any advice on this?"

And I know he's trying to do what he believes is right, but I also know it's based in misunderstanding.  So when I wrote back, this is what I said:

Hey Dad,

I didn't respond to your other email in part because it took so long for me to get to reading it. I respect you probably more than any other person I know or have met, which means you have a lot of power to hurt me. I had [my wife] read it first in case there was anything that needed immediate response, and I read it just this past week; it was thankfully not nearly as hurtful as I was afraid it could be. That being said, I think I have a pretty clear understanding of where you and mom sit on this issue. I know you don't approve and I know it gives you anguish and I wish I knew a way to help you understand. My biggest fear is that this becomes a real rift between us and you decide my family and I are no longer welcome.

We could go back and forth, I could say that an innocent only feels guilty and the guilty only feels innocent if their conscience has been poorly formed, and you could retort that on this mine must be, and I would ask when or how in 30 years of Catholic upbringing that could be possible. You could say, ""I don't know, it just is,"" because I disagree with you and that's clearly a problem. I could say that our understanding of biology is extremely limited, that scientists are currently finding that the X and Y dichotomy isn't as black-and-white in nature (even in humans) as we've always thought, that none of it accounts for intersex individuals. I could say that you make sweeping assumptions on how I think and how my body experiences the world based on the fact that I was born with a penis, and a lot of those assumptions are apparently false - because that's NOT my experience. The way people talk, I DON'T ""think like a man,"" and though I haven't had invasive testing done I contend that mine is in fact a woman's brain, and that's the root of all of this. Put plainly, this is a kind of biological intersex condition. I understand that there are lots of things I will not experience, and I do not at all imagine that any of this will ""make me"" a woman. I am a woman. I could mention the tests that I HAVE done, that show that my testosterone levels are shockingly low, well below male levels and only a little above female levels. I could say that between that and [my wife]'s PCOS it's a miracle that we have any children at all, let alone 4! That's another piece of this that's convinced me of God's active hand in all our lives.

I could say all of that and we could keep going, but in the end that's not the point. The point is that I have this condition, which neither of us are denying, and that gives us three options: treat the mind, treat the body, or do nothing. Doing nothing is right out. [My wife] would leave me. I was a miserable person before and she won't subject herself or our kids to that any more. And she's 100% in the right, too. If you guys didn't see it, how much [my wife] and [my oldest child] were hurting, how honestly traumatized Missy was, then that's all the better for you and testament to how good I've been at wearing masks. I was always angry and sad and withdrawn; I would lash out. I don't care to describe it and I certainly don't care to go back to it. 

So, I have this condition, and we either treat the mind or we treat the body. There is no third option. But ""treating the mind"" demonstrably does not work. Every major group involved in studying and treating the mind agrees that the transgender condition is not one that is responsive to psychological therapies. It doesn't matter WHY that's the case, but it doesn't work. In every case they've tried, there's a 50% rate of suicide and even people who ""complete"" the program are not cured - they may go into ""remission"" for a time, but there are no permanent success stories. I won't risk a 50% chance of suicide to try something that has no evidence of a possible positive outcome; that would be insane. 

Which leaves us with treating the body, which does have evidence of success, with transgender people going through medical transition and living long, healthy lives. There are almost no cases where patients regret transition itself; mostly they regret losing people who wouldn't accept them, or regret the poor treatment they've received from people. Unless you know otherwise, there has been no study comparing transgender people who forego transition to people who go through with it (and I imagine there can't be, not now, as the first group would surely be closeted, if they were aware of their condition at all). The studies I've seen compare post-transition transgender people with cisgender people, and show that transgender folks have a higher rate of depression than cisgender folks. Which is great but tells us nothing about the effectiveness of treatment. The largest contributing factor for transgender people's depression is the way they're treated by other people - being told we aren't ""Real"" men and ""Real"" women, the threat of losing jobs, the threat of actual violence. These are things cisgender people don't have to deal with, so of course more transgender people would have higher depression, even after treatment. But I should be clear: getting treatment isn't what makes me transgender. I will always be transgender, regardless of the path, because that's just the description of my experience of myself and the world. I never have been and never will be a cis boy, and that is fundamental to the person I am (even before I had words for this condition).

I know you think it's selfish of me to pursue treatment, though I really can't understand why. Is it selfish to get chemotherapy? Is it selfish to take insulin for diabetes? You talk about my responsibilities to [my wife] and the kids, how they deserve a Husband and a Father. But I am what I am, I can only give what I have, and treatment isn't going to alter that. If something can ""only come from a father,"" and that means a cis-male figure, then I am already incapable of providing it. It could be argued that our family is deficient because of me, because I should never have been in this position - and on one level I can't argue, but I also strongly disagree. I think God put me here specifically, gave me to [my wife] and granted us our children specifically, and not despite me being transgender. I think my life might've been easier if I'd known I was a girl 10 or 15 years ago, but it wouldn't have been better; [my wife]'s and [my oldest]'s and [my second]'s and [my son]'s lives wouldn't have been better. Our family is not the ideal, but it's here and we need to do what we can with what we have. And all of us, my whole family, are better off with me getting treatment. It won't be easy, it won't be 100%, but it will be much, much better. It already is.

And you're right, you can't imagine how this will affect my kids. I can't imagine it. But medical professionals have done research and found that kids do remarkably well in these situations. Better than kids in divorce, better than kids where mom &amp;amp; dad ""stay together for the kids,"" and I'm sure better than my kids were doing with me a year or more ago. I know you worry about them, and I appreciate that, and I think you should definitely pray that we have a best-case outcome. I believe that with faith and consideration and understanding our kids will make it through this fine.

I knew [your pastor] briefly years ago. I've already seen him a lot more at your church than I ever saw him at mine. I don't like to say bad things about priests, but I won't be talking to him about this.

I recognize and appreciate your advice, and I do honestly appreciate your calling me out when you think I'm going wrong. I agree that is a very important part of true love and care. I am happy with who I am, for the first time I can remember; I understand myself and my experiences in a much more clear and consistent way, and the positive difference it's made is huge. I can't overstate that - who I am today is demonstrably better than who I was a year ago. I have been struggling with an image of who I thought I should be for thirty years, and now I can see why that was so difficult and painful for me and those around me. So I can't take your advice because while I know and appreciate that it comes from a place of love, I also believe it's based on misunderstanding and would be harmful for me. I've done a lot of thinking and praying and research on this, and I continue each of those every day; I am confident in my direction, and [my wife] supports me completely.

I sincerely love you, too,

carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,How did you KNOW you were transgender?,"So I'm sort of building up to coming out to some people, probably, maybe, possibly, if I don't chicken out. I'm pretty damn certain that I'm trans, but putting it into words is tricky. I often find this, I'll know what I mean, but the knowledge in my head didn't have word to go with it and I struggle to explain it to others (high functioning autism). Plus I'm a very nervous person when opening up about this sort of thing, but at the same time often naive about other people and how accepting they might be or if they would understand.

I can't really say I am certain because of one thing, it's more down to a lot of things; how I feel about thoughts on being female vs being male, how I feel about a future as female vs male, how I feel when looking in the mirror both when I see just a guy vs when I can almost see a woman (albeit a quite masculine looking one). There's also some smaller things,  I don't think they're really up to being *evidence* so to speak, they're more indicative or supporting evidence; I spend an inordinate amount of time daydreaming into escapist fantasies, almost all of which I'm female in, I find myself being a hell of a lot more invested in stories with female protagonists, being very jealous of female friends especially when they're discussing bra shopping, and I started picking female characters for video games a while back and now it feels really weird to voluntarily pick a male character. Oh, and my sexuality, ""straight"" never quite fit, not the word so much as the idea of me as a man with a woman, but lesbian, me as a woman with a woman, sits a lot better in my head.

Does the above sound about right? Any suggestions on better wording maybe? What about better explanations for cis folk? (most of my good friends are lgbt+ so I'm not worried about them but I will need to come out to my parents) I'm not planning on coming out for a few weeks, maybe a month or two depending on some things in life right now, so it's not a dire emergency."

I've never seen someone with a manly face put on a load of makeup and then end up looking like a woman.

So I've been 'am I *really really* trans'-ing up this board for like 6 months now and feel like I haven't really gotten anywhere. I've experimented and have been seeing a therapist twice a week but I feel really stuck. Basically everything's under such scrutiny that even the stuff that would make me feel fundamentally nice and warm inside has been picked apart and over-analysed to the point where everything seems 'fake' or unbelievable. A new development with this has been that now the actual goals of transition, even the point really, i.e living as your preferred gender, existing and being recognized as such socially; seems *really fucking scary.* Like I know the whole 'trans plus scared/doubts' thing but I feel like that's more in regards to the ramifications of transition rather than transition itself.

amon_erin,asktransgender,"Am I stupid, crazy, or ???","Tomorrow is five weeks on HRT. I'm loving everything physical, but I still haven't gotten the awesome calmness everyone talks about. And I still have a low-grade headache, but that has been getting better lately. It's just that the last week or two I've been fighting with myself as much as I was before I started HRT about what my gender is. Maybe I have OCD about my doubts. I don't know.

I woke up from sort of a nap and I sort of felt like I have to give up and stay a boy. This basically happens at the beginning of each work week. The more I go out in public since starting HRT, the more I find myself wrestling with who I am. Getting gendered as male in public usually sends me into a spiral of doubt. I still go out in boy mode because I'd be so visibly trans that I worry for my safety. 

So I sat here on my couch in tears with my pills in my hand feeling like everything is a waste of time. I keep getting caught up that I can't seem to internalize that I'm not really a guy. I don't want to be one. Sometimes I feel like I am trying to pick my gender.

Perhaps I'm putting too much pressure on myself. I know this is a long process, but some days are just so bad. Even fighting with myself today I'd look in the mirror and almost start crying because I still see a boy. I don't like that. This has consumed my life and I feel like I'm never going to make it.

So am I stupid for continuing on? I really don't want to stop, but I feel like this just a waste of time and I'll never get where I want to be."

I dont want to be doing this for attention, and I want this to be right for me, but it might not be :/. im depressed in my room right now just unable to see myself as a girl and unable to see myself as a man. I feel like shit. I hate my life. When I wear leggings out I get laughed at, when people come into my flat and they dont know about me, they are awkward and rude.

SafeHayven,asktransgender,Are there any other non-feminine AMAB trans people here?,"I was AMAB, and I'm physically transitioning to female (laser hair removal, hormones, and eventually GRS). This is to relieve my severe dysphoria around my male physical characteristics. 

With that said, I'm not ""feminine"" in any conventional sense, and I identify as agender / nonbinary. I don't like dresses, skirts, or high heels (I tried dressing this way when I first started transitioning -- it just wasn't me. I especially despise ""girly"" shoes), I almost never wear makeup (I just don't like it), and my favorite clothes are plaid shirts, jeans, and (flat!!) boots. My hair is short and in a sidecut. My big hobbies are hiking, mountaineering, skiing, and reading, none of which are particularly feminine. If I passed as cis people would probably think I was a lesbian.

I have literally never met another AMAB trans person who is like this. Everyone seems to be really into femininity, and while I do have some feminine personality traits (my voice, especially, is ridiculously high and girly-sounding), I'm hardly a femme.

But if we take anti androgens for long enough, they ""chemically castrate"" us - is that right? I.e. our testes shrink and no longer produce the same amount of SPERM, but what about T? Are we ""castrated"" but somehow still producing androgens?

So I've been in the closet, and recently I went to a meeting about inclusion on campus. Most people who attended were white and cisgender RAs so I decided to give my transgender perspective, which effectively outed me to the RAs on my floor in my dorm.

The first thing they did after the meeting was done was grab me and the other kid from my floor who came. We went into a private study room and the first thing they did was apologize for not knowing and ask what they could do to make me more comfortable. The other kid who was there came out himself and said he was gay and then I discovered we have similar interests and now we're getting to be friends. :)

Edgyusernamexx,asktransgender,How to stop a particular group for consistently touching me (mtf),"I don't mean to bash people who are penis attracted or male attracted or gay etc. I hsve many gay friends, more so now than ever it's really awesome... But for some reason this one particular group and pretty much this group only doesn't have good social boundaries...let me expand:

A full year into hormones (mtf) I have been assaulted once by a gay man at a bar (hands around my throat), given an unwelcome shoulder massage by my now former therapist (fucking creepy), touched up a bit and same shoulder touching deal from an assistant professor in a voice training seminar on campus, hugged and cheek kissed and squeezed by the person at the desk just for walking into a pride center, and had my ass slapped by 2 guys at a pride festival. They were in official uniform or whatever like the t shirts of being staff. And the first day on HRT I was pushed into the arms of a glitter covered man at a music festival by his glitter covered friend.

Why do men do this? 

The factor I notice in common with literally all these examples is - - It's always the ones with the high voice and usually they're older than 30. I don't know what that's called, but I'm now actively threatened by it. You know what I mean. I don't generally hear my generation do this whatsoever.

I can only assume by their particular voice thst they are attracted to me because they're gay and let's be real I'm not a cis girl and have masculine features. 


What is this attitude? Why are they all so similar? And how do I make it clear that it isn't okay to fucking touch me? I've taken to carrying a stun gun anyway,  but you can't exactly use thst when it's the men in authority that are touching you and it always comes on so suddenly. But it always happens. Especially when there is no one to help you. Its like I tell myself if I hang near them I'll be okay, but pretty much 4 of the 5 times it's happened it's not been okay.

Is there proper protocol?

 Who do I tell? 

Are there websites to warn other trans girls to fucking avoid certain people? That is a slippery slope...

The first time (my therapist) I literally just didn't ever return and left immediately. I told him I was thinking of a female name and he got up went across the room and touched my shoulders. Wtf. He didn't have a boss so there isn't much else to do. Every time subsequent the phrase ""DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH ME"" had been bold loud and clear, other than in the classroom where I didn't say fuck. I did file a report against him with the school.

Am I doing something that entitles this specific demographic to touch me? What is about this particular group that cannot and will not stop touching me? I have my social theories about them being damaged and such, but it doesn't matter if it's neurological it's consistent and threatening. 

This post comes on the heels of a gay man grabbing my ass at a bar. It's just the last straw. I wanted to break his nose, but I left crying instead. I don't hurt people, especially ones I know would probably crybaby on social media. (irony) 

Has anyone else had trouble with these types? It's getting to the point where I hear the voice and I literally walk away from whoever it is. And that's a shame because I don't want to generalize... But it's always the same around my neck of the woods. 

I can count on 2 hands the particular times I've been touched up like this and only once was it was a woman sticking a finger in my ass during a back massage. Yup. 

Why are people so creepy? Would scary demon tattoos help? 
Is there a posture I can adjust to or adjust my voice to keep these moths from finding me like a flame? Even before I transitioned I remember these types hugging me and trying to cuddle me. Is it my shirt color? Ugh.

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"My overly restrictive Endocrinologist thinks that my high T levels and low E levels are fine, and that bioidentical progesterone is too dangerous to be taken. I'm not sure what to do.","I'm on Kaiser Permanente in the Mid-Atlantic region.

On Friday morning, I was preparing for my 6-month blood test to check on my hormone levels, liver function, blood count, and cholesterol.  Nervous as hell that my Endo would say no (because she has been overly restrictive in the past), I sent her an email, telling her that I'm off to get my blood test, and asking her if I could please start taking micronized progesterone, i.e. prometrium, which is bioidentical.

I told her that for months I'd been reading up on it, trying to find out if it's worth it, what form of progesterone to take, what forms of P to avoid, whether to cycle or not cycle it, whether to take creams or pills.  I told her that it seemed from what I'd researched that micronized progesterone, i.e. prometrium (or its generic form) is bioidentical, and seems promising, whereas medroxyprogesterone acetate, which is a synthetic progestin, seems to be associated with numerous bad side effects.  And that most of what I had read pointed to taking it daily (rather than cycling it) being the better course.  I asked her if I might start taking micronized progesterone, and which form of it would be better, pills, or some form of cream.

A day later, on Saturday, she responded, saying that the results from my blood test had just come in, and that my hormones are in the target range, my liver function, blood count and cholesterol are normal, and that I should continue with my current regimen.  I looked at my [test results](http://i.imgur.com/pfRb9su.png), and got worried.  My Testosterone, Total, and Testosterone, Free levels had tripled since my last test 6 months ago.  My Estradiol levels had fallen.  It's hard to find a consistent target range for hormone levels for trans women.  I've heard that your Total T levels should be &lt;55 ng/dl, 8-60 ng/dl, 6-86 ng/dl, and some other values.  [The Endocrine Society](http://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/Endocrine-Treatment-of-Transsexual-Persons.pdf) says the following: 

&gt; Serum testosterone levels should be &lt;55 ng/dl.
&gt; Serum estradiol should not exceed the peak physiological range for young healthy females, with ideal levels, 200 pg/ml

Whereas the [Royal College of Psychiatrists](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/files/pdfversion/CR181_Nov15.pdf) says the following:

&gt; Circulating  levels  of  testosterone  and, ideally, dihydrotestosterone levels should be monitored to ensure they are suppressed to well below the normal male range.
&gt;  Transcutaneous  oestradiol  using 50–150 mcg patches two or three times a week can be used and monitored serum levels of oestradiol at 48h after application of a patch should be in the upper half of the normal follicular range (80-140 pg/ml).

In my case, in the past 6 months, my Total T levels have nearly tripled, from 26 to 74 ng/dl, which places me above the range listed by the Endocrine Society.  My Free T levels have likewise tripled.  My E levels have fallen from 92.3 to 82.2 pg/ml, so if the target range is supposed to be 80-140, then my levels are on the very low side of the reference range, and if the target range is supposed to be 100-200 or 125-200 (the target range for E varies from source to source), then my levels are well below the reference range.

I responded to my Endocrinologist with the following email:

&gt; I am a bit surprised that my Testosterone, Total and Testosterone, Free levels seem to have tripled since my last test on 3/18.  Is this level of variation in T levels to be expected? May I ask what the target range is for Testosterone and Estradiol?

She responded to my request to start taking progesterone by saying that she hasn't used Progesterone for her transgender patients, and that the guideline on Progesterone for transgender women states that progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) are sometimes used, but they do not recommend them as part of standard hormonal care for transgender women, because MPA has been associated with excess cardiovascular and breast cancer risk in older postmenopausal women taking conjugated estrogen.  The guideline goes on to say that there are reports that progestins interfere with optimal estrogen-induced breast development when inducing puberty in girls, yet some clinicians claim improved breast development with progestins despite absence of evidence for that.  She concluded by saying that she doesn't recommend trying it.

I responded to the Progesterone part of her email with the following:

&gt; In the guideline that you reference, they talk of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).  I also have heard bad things about MPA, which is a synthetic progestin.  From what I've read, it sounds like MPA is as bad as the conjugated estrogen that was given to patients prior to bioidentical Estradiol.  I definitely wouldn't want to take MPA.  But I've heard good things about Micronized Progesterone (Prometrium), which is bioidentical.

At this point I felt like crap.  Not only had my Endocrinologist denied my request to start taking bioidentical progesterone, but she had done so by saying that synthetic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate have bad side effects.  I know they have bad side effects, that's why I specifically requested to take bioidentical progesterone and not synthetic progestins (and also, I'm not taking conjugated estrogen, and I'm not a post-menopausal woman aged 50-79).  Furthermore, my hormone levels seem to have become borderline (though that's hard to measure when the border and the line vary from one source to the next) or possibly out of the reference range, but she considers them to be in the target range.

The next day (Sunday) I sent an email to a Urologist I had talked to a week or so prior, who was recommended to me as the expert in the Urology department on treating transgender women, and who did my friend's orchidectomy.  I asked him if it was possible for me to seek a second opinion with an Endocrinologist who was considered to be the expert on treating transgender women for their department, as he was considered to be the expert Urologist on treating transgender women.  Did he know anyone who might fit the bill? My hormone levels had changed significantly and were not firmly in the female range, and I had gotten worried, and it would put me at ease if I could seek a second opinion.

Now it's early Tuesday morning, and I haven't received a response from either my Endocrinologist or my expert Urologist, who are both often prompt in sending replies, which makes me worry that maybe I said the wrong thing? Did I accidentally say something offensive? Was I out of line by requesting a second opinion, and asking if there are any Endocrinologists in this network who are considered experts on treating transgender women? Am I just overreacting and everything is fine?  Should I have asked my Primary Care Physician for the second opinion instead, even though she wasn't referred to me as the expert on transgender women in her department?

This is my second attempt at going through puberty, and I'm trying very very hard to get it right this time, and devoting a ton of time, energy, money, and discomfort to the pursuit.  The idea that this whole time (15 months) my E levels have been too low (and that they're now lower) is frightening, and I don't think I'm out of line in wanting to get a second opinion.  I'm trying to wait patiently for a reply and keep from freaking out any further.

**Edit**~I got a reply back from the Urologist who is an expert in trans care, and he said that no, there is not a designated trans expert in terms of Endocrinology.  He said that there should be one soon, and then he would let me know who that is.

I guess that means that my remaining hope is that my current Endo becomes more willing to budge.

**Edit 2**~My Endo returned my email and said:

1) Her target range for total testosterone is &lt;80 ng/dl, and for estrogen 70-150 pg/ml

2) She will not recommend using Progesterone due to lack of clinical evidence of its benefits.

I spoke to a Kaiser case manager for transgender patients, who advised me to see my Endo in person once (appt made for Friday), see if I can bring her around to upping my dosage and adding P, and if that doesn't work, she can hook me up with a second opinion no problem, and give me a list of what she called ""preferred providers"" for trans patients, in the Mid-Atlantic network.  They're much farther away, but I reckon it's worth it if they have more trans experience."
late_bloomer26,asktransgender,I finally got hormones! Any tips?,"I'm sooooo excited!

I was prescribed: 
* 100mg Spiro
* 2mg Estradiol
* 100mg Progesterone
* 5mg Finasteride

I trust my doctor (he was highly recommended), but I just wanted to see how common it is to get all four of those. I was told to cycle the Progesterone by taking it the first ten days of each month only. I was also thinking about cutting the Spiro and Estradiol in half so I can take it every twelve hours instead of every 24. Lastly, I don't really have an issues with baldness - do I really need Finasteride?

I plan to email my doctor about all this, but I wanted some more info first.

feeling_supersonic,asktransgender,There is this cute guy. I'd like to date him. My transness makes me insecure. Advice?,"I have a crush on a guy at uni. We have a course together. He's extremely cute. Well, I do have a crush on him for a reason.

I am very shy about anything romantic, before I was out as trans it was even worse. I've never been in a relationship. Whenever I was in love or crushing on someone I just waited for the feeling to pass. Plus, the mere thought of someone being interested in me as a female caused me major dysphoria. 

But I really like this guy, he makes me nervous (that hasn't happened in a long time, let me tell you). He told me he does not believe in monosexuality (it was course related) and reacted well to me coming out (""well, that's good, so I know how to refer to you"") so I think me being trans is maybe not even a problem for him. I still don't know if he could be into me though.

But I have no idea how to proceed. I am like a 13 year old. I am scared. Does anyone have any advice?"

This is my message to all the anxious trans people out there, don't succumb to your fears they aren't there to help you, they're only there to hold you back. Fear is irrational while the way you truly feel is meaningful, I know what it's like to feel immense fear of the worst happening heck i have lived my worst nightmares due to OCD, but that has never stopped me from becoming the girl I know I am."
Aldawolf,asktransgender,Really frustrated just want to rant,"Past 6 months my mental health has been fucking trash I'll admit it. Anxiety, OCD and depression were just making life awful. On a new medication, past month I've been able to go to school, depression and OCD are pretty much dormant but my anxiety is p high and I'm not sure how keen I am on starting ANOTHER med (Im on like 3 already). I've started barely some cognitive behavioral therapy. I was told to wait for HRT but I got desperate and tried to go through planned parenthood with informed consent. Problem is my anxiety was super high at the time and when I'm anxious I don't really panic but I lose my train of thought and it's hard for me to form words. I'm pretty much always anxious but it was pretty bad there. Doctor said I seemed ""unsure"" about my decision and wanted a counselors note. I just agreed to it without thinking, thinking I could work with my counselor to see if my semester goes well I can start. Tried to talk to the doctor about not needing counselor but he was kind of adamant on it. Talk with my counselor, ask how much I have to do to be healthy enough. I pretty much get non-answers but she says 1 semester wouldn't be enough. I really hate this because she told me a story of a ftm who had to wait 3-4 years to get HRT which I wouldn't mind if I weren't fucking turning 20 here soon. It's also some gatekeepy bullshit because ftm HRT isn't even a mood destabalizer so I just wonder what kind of fucking standards I have to live up to to satisfy. I'm MTF so the mood destabalization is pretty relevant but I don't want to wait years to get healthy and its FUCKING frustrating when my friend who's only roadblock to HRT was waiting a few months for the system to process her just tells me ""Tough, deal with it"" like the situations are fucking comparable and gives me a whole load of shit about it. My counselor is amazing at helping me but she's not experienced with trans and its just frustrating as hell to not know what fucking expectations I have to live up to. PP is pretty much the only provider in my city and god I feel hopeless right now about this all, I just want a goddamn idea for how long I have to wait but everyone refuses to give me something

biasedgopher,asktransgender,struggling...,"Okay, so, 

I've been questioning my sexuality since pre highschool (22, male), and have been lurking this particular page for a few months...

At first i was just wanting to open up and expand my knowledge of the lgbtq (especially trans community), maybe broaden my vocabulary, you, generally be informed.

Lately, however, what I've been reading here specifically makes a lot of sense, and connects with me on an emotional level, and as this was unexpected(?), I'm kinda freaking out.

My entire life I've presented as straight, i was an athlete, always had one woman or another in bed, etc, etc... After spending a few months lurking, I've started to notice things from my past that weren't always so obvious: wanting to play dress up constantly, having female friends because I felt I could converse with them better, trying to shave my legs when I was 10.... Wearing girls clothes... Realizing that all that all the women I was fucking was because I admired their body in a way that a hetero sexual male decidedly doesn't... Even the women in porn I envied... I've been with a few men, and sexually I'm fairly submissive (I thought it was a phase until recently)

I have a serious girlfriend (live in) and for the last few days I haven't been able to look her in the eyes, i haven't been able to sleep, and I'm feeling very, very dissociative every time I think about it (especially as I write this)...

What i need to know, is, is this normal? Is it me being that much in denial/terrified? Am I trans? Where do I go from here? What can I expect? How much does HRT cost?

I'm so lost, and confused right now... Help? "
ciggycici,asktransgender,Alcholic workaholic gamble addict drug addict gym addict,"I was born 21 years ago unfortionalitly 

My spelling sucks and aprently this site dosent have spell check 

Anyways im kinda trans or some shit like that but fit more into a gender fluid carogory 

Just so you all are aware 

I hate what society and the LGBT community has done for trans people 
There are people that are born male/female and there gender dosent match there genitalia 

But all these weak minded highschool kids claiming that they are trans it irritates me 
The ammount of people that are trans dident shoot up 40% out of no where 
And these kids are going to live it for maybe a year or a few years then be like oh shit i was wrong 
And its just going to reinforce the belief that being trans is a mentil disease or a immature phase- which gor half these fucking emo wannabe kids it is but for the actual trans population its fucking irritating 


But anyways 
I realised i had feelings of wishing i was female or having a female body when i was 5 or 6 
But wasent sure what to call it bla bla bla 

When i was 10,11,12,13 being emo or scene or femmy gothic was popular - and i used that as an excuse to dress like a girl - girls skinny jeans and my hair down in the front and spiked in the back 
And girl tshirts with a hoodie usaly 

And i fit in more with girls and bla bla bla 

When i was 14 ,15 i moved to tennasee with my dad 
And basicly droped anything girly and started smoking cigs and drinking amps and abusing caffine pills regularly 

Ive always had what a crack doctor would call symptoms of depression and anixty even tho there just made up so the government can keep the population doped up and dependent on drugs 

I was a loner so i just smoked and went to school and spent alot of time on my phone and music 

I moved back to mn when i was 15 or so 
And started messing with my style again 
But at this point wanted to be male and feel male and just make all the needing to be female feelings go away 
Just went to school and stuff 
When i was 16 i started fucking with drugs weed and liquor everyday pills 1-3 times a week 
Dabled with cocaine and addys and stuff like that a little bit 
But well i was doing drugs and being a junkie and couch hoping and fucking dieing i dident have anywhere near as much trans thoughts and dysphoria feelings 

I did some stupid shit and caught a charge and was put on probation and had to drop all drug use immeditly 

When you stop drinking a pint of 151 a day cold turky your life will flash before you as your lying on the ground in pain 

And never have i had worse trans feelings in my life 

And after that i finished highschool 6 months late 
Went and fucked around at college 

Got more nerve up for the female stuff i would wear 

But basicly wore leggins skator ahoes a long tank and a hoodie everyday 

Have more friends now 

But just got off probation and have been drinking everyday been doing cocaine the last 3 days 
And smoking weed fairly regularly 

Im splitting the rent with my cuzen 
And im dating the best girl in the world and were engaged 
She knows how i feel about trans stuff 

I just try to burry it all 

The more i shut up and hold everything in the better life goes 

Im not going to take pills to make my masculine boddy get all gender netural and nasty then get mad when people dont except me 

If i die from the bullshit in my head so fucking be  it

SuperWorker,asktransgender,How can I best reach out to the transgender community to find individuals interested in adoption?,"I am an adoptions worker. My job is to find families for children and teens who don't have one. As many people here likely know, transgender youth are vastly overrepresented among foster children. They are more likely to be abused or abandoned than other children. Worse, transgender youth have a much harder time finding adoptive parents, and subsequently are more likely to languish in the system, living in group homes. From what I have seen, transitioning can be a difficult and emotional process, and one that is unique enough that many people feel out of their depth with regards to assisting others through the process. 

To address this, I am hoping to reach out directly to the transgender community in order to find adults who not only share experiences and have the unique ability to understand the challenges facing these youth, but to help them find a lifelong family that will give them the unconditional love, support, and respect that they deserve.

Any thoughts on outreach?

When people say your body stops after puberty and even when Cis-men  take testosterone their voice don't continue to deepen.

And why won't cis-women simply take HRT to enlarge.. Instead of surgery which seems to be the more common thing to do."

not-your-moms-cock,asktransgender,Anyone have an active sex life before transition? [NSFW],"(Reposted with a better-phrased title, sorry about that)
(Still very new to Reddit)

Hi Reddit! I’ve been lurking here for a few weeks, finally posting — I've got a question about sex.

TL;DR -- can anyone who transitioned later in life (namely after becoming sexually active as their birth-assigned gender) talk about how their sex lives changed upon starting transition? Bonus points if you had a long term romantic partner through your transition.

For anyone who can take the time, I feel like providing some context about myself and my situation may help — I’m AMAB, 20 years old, been gender questioning (essentially MtF, or something like it) now for about… six months? I grew up in a really rural, conservative, religious area, so I never really knew transgender was actually a thing until this year. I was going to do the obligatory “am I actually transgender?” first post, but after lurking for a bit, I’m becoming more self-aware and have accepted that I’m a trans woman, or at the very least not a cis male. But some things aren’t exactly congruent for me — before thinking about my gender identity, I never really questioned it too much, because I didn’t really know that I could. I’ve had two romantic and sexual partners in the last three years — that first relationship broke off because (hah) she said I wasn’t enough of a man for her. I’m still happily in the second relationship, have been for a little over seven months — she’s been EXTREMELY supportive and understanding of my transition process, I couldn’t be more lucky. However, she has some legitimate concerns about our sex life. Basically, the gist of her main question is “what changed?” Because now that I’m aware of my trans-ness, I do feel very uncomfortable using my penis — but it's strange, I still want to have sex, and I'm still sexually interested in my girlfriend... I don't know how clear any of this actually is, I'm just really confused, and could stand to hear from anyone else who dealt with something similar. Help?

That's the choice I'm making now, and the field is computer science / software development, not exactly known for being super accepting. I kind of feel like I'd rather skip any networking events for now until my hrt starts to make a difference."

The learning teams are comprised of the same students for all four years, so we all end up forming very intimate working relationships.
I'm not out to my learning team yet, but there's an opportunity to do so that I'd like to get some thoughts/opinions on:
My team gets along well, and we periodically get together for social outings. It has become a pattern that one of our team members always has everyone go around and say one secret as a fun social/bonding activity. Typically, the secrets are silly/simple like ""I never had any wisdom teeth"" or ""I was a cup-stacking champion in elementary school"". We have another planned outing tomorrow, and it kind of seems like this would be a good time to bring my transition up with my group as my ""secret"", although I'm concerned that it will be too serious of a ""secret"" to share... Fortunately my team is largely LGBTQ-friendly (one of our team members is openly gay and others are very strong allies) so I'm not worried too much about any serious/nasty retaliation, but of course disclosing something this significant is likely to change something somehow.

After coming out, my dad seemed supportive and i dragged him to my pediatrician who explained to him what it meant and told him and i that i needed to goto a therapist before i can begin HRT. This made me pretty happy as my dad scheduled a meeting with an absolutely amazing therapist (her youngest daughter is trans!). I was looking forward to that meeting all week, then instead he brought me to this guy who basically said he doesn't care what you want to do he will help you do it, which i thought was great because i thought it would be like an IC clinic right? well i was wrong as he told me numerous times that he doesn't believe me when i tell him i am trans and wont believe that its the cause of my depression (like i literally tried to cut off a certain appendage a couple years ago??). I then went on a school trip where i wasnt with my family for a week. When i came back i found that my parents had completely changed everything, they made everything extremely strict and took away any electronic device i had (basically only have an old laptop now), they even removed the door on my room so they could watch me 100% of the time. He told me before i left on the trip that i would be meeting the real therapist (the one i like) on the monday, but instead just didnt tell me he cancelled it and just left me at home. I have made a couple posts about this and i dont know what to do anymore, nothing has changed and i think im becoming suicidal again."

ShakeBunny100489,asktransgender,Significant swelling several months after surgery?,"Kind of worried here.

I had surgery with Chet back in June. Since day one, one side of my vagina has been larger than the other. Chet was going to do a free revision, but ultimately decided against it because he wanted to wait for the swelling to go down.

Fast forward to recently. Up until a few days ago things have been alright. Dialating has been difficult but I'm still doing it on schedule. So, I moved into a new apartment which required a lot of lifting and such.

I went to dialate last night, and the slightly bigger side is now very very swollen, and it hurts. The other side looks totally fine and doesn't hurt at all. I figured for months of waiting would be more than enough for me to be able to move things around again.

So, any ideas? I have a doctor's appointment at my local LGBT center so hopefully she can help but otherwise I'm still very worried."

IBYMBYBMYL,asktransgender,I maybe kind of accidentally tipped my friend off?,"I was skyping with my friend about an hour ago, and we sometimes get into pretty heated political debates. Me being a socialist and him a Trump loving ""alt right"" hardcore capitalist.

Typical reactionary bullshit. Well, I got pretty pissed off, way more than usual (this is what I'm worried about, every other time we've argued over politics we laugh it off when we start getting angry with each other.)

I'm pretty fucking scared that he might be suspicious now. This isn't the first time I've gotten angry about trans stuff when talking to him. I'm afraid if he did find out he'd hate me and then tell all our old high school friends and then word would find It's way to my family. We grew up in a very rural small farm community. Gossip travels fast. 

Now I know what some people will say. ""Just cut him off."" or something. The problem is he's literally my only real friend or even person I talk to on a regular basis aside from my family.

I was on a trans forum (been wondering about the possibility of me being trans for a few months that now) when someone mentioned that they knew they were nonbinary because they didn't really have a sense of gender. I thought about it, and mine isn't entirely present either.

Then I thought that since I hadn't experienced dysphoria, I can't be trans. I'm fine with my voice, genitalia, body, clothing style, etc. But I don't feel entirely male. Could I be agender or graygender or something? 

Tldr: I think I'm a- or graygender or neutrois, but I'm fine with my body and biological male-ness. Also, bonus points if anyone has any suggestions on how to dress androgynously as an amab person."

So, has anyone gone through a surgical procedure that raised their pitch (so men transitioning to females), and after recovering, were you able to sing with your new voice well, or did it sound strange or was your range limited? Of course, since I'm not transgender, I wouldn't want to raise the pitch to a female level. Any info helps. Thanks

I went in to see the doctor who had no clue about trans issues...only wanting to blame PTSD for my want to change. This is where I am hoping someone can help!

Yukinoona,asktransgender,"As an ally, what's it like changing your view about a person's gender?","This is a question for allys, friends, family, significant others or acquaintences of trans people...

Recently, I realized that people I've known since before transitioning tend to misgender me more often compared to strangers and people I've met since (who typically gender me correctly). Old friends of mine who are very supportive will still occasionally use my old pronoun. They are apologetic about it, but it still slips out.

So that got me thinking, even if you support and care about someone who is trans, it might still be difficult to change your view of that person if you've known them a long time (even if they look completely different!) Furthermore, if transparent discussion isn't an option, it might be difficult to know how to treat that person. Do they want to be treated in a particular way? For example, if they subscribe to a gender binary do they care about being treated like others of that gender? Alternatively, if they want to get rid of pronouns, does that clash with your everyday use with others? 

These kinds of questions made me wonder what the experience might be like from the perspective of an ally (or friend, SO, etc...). What things do you personally find, make it easier or harder to treat a trans person in a manner that aligns with their wishes? What kinds of experiences lead you to ""change"" your internal gender designation of that person, if any?

What is **your** experience?

**DISCLAIMER** - I am **not** suggesting that gender *should* be an important aspect of a person that determines how others treat them. For *some* people it is. I think that debate belongs elsewhere. The questions I've asked can be answered on the basis of how a person *wants to be treated*, gender-wise or not."

bluekorra19,asktransgender,"I've made a decision. Maybe it's not the best decision, but I can't just do nothing anymore.","I've been a semi lurker for over a year now. (AMAB, 20 y/o) First off, I'm so grateful a place like this exists. Seeing so many people just accept one another for who they are is such a beautiful thing. This sub has been here for me in my darkest times of confusion and my best times as well.

On December 19, 2014, The Legend of Korra's finale aired. I had taken a deep interest in the shipping of Korra and Asami, the two female leads. As the finale aired, I felt emotion like I had never felt before inside me. I was happy, yet sad. I realized I was sad because I'd never be able to be a girl like Korra and Asami. What I'd witnessed was the subtle buildup of a relationship so pure and so loving, and it was between two young women. I realized that I wanted to be a girl. I found r/ask transgender shortly after by simply typing ""I want to be a girl"" in the Google search bar. 

So I slowly started doing more things usually associated with females. I shaved my legs regularly and let my hair grow to my shoulders. On online games, I posed as female, happily chatting away, as no one would know any better. And it felt good. This all escalated until I visited a therapist. The first therapist had no experience in gender issues, so I was referred to a gender therapist. I had a bad experience with her as she didn't let me talk a lot. So I stopped going, giving up on therapy. I discovered that r/transdiy existed. I took advantage of it and ordered a few months supply worth of estradiol and spiroloctanate, figuring I could gauge my bodies reaction to it to find out if it was for me.

On July 13, I took my first dosage of HRT. I know the differences you feel are solely mental as nothing really happens, but I felt like I was doing something good. It's been a little more than 3 months and I've decided to stop. I know I was headed in the right direction, but I don't think now is the time. I want to be independent. I'm very fortunate that I have such a caring family, but if I don't break away, I fear I'll never leave home. I want to get away from home (Hawaii) and just transition in peace with no family around.

So my plan now is to go back to school in the spring. Spend a few years and get a degree in anything while working on the side, saving up while living at home. Then I'll move away. I'll be all by myself, free to do what I want on my own time. And while physically, I'm not the person I want to be, I think the years I've spent(18 to now 20), have helped me develop a more mature outlook on myself. I know I'm transgender. That explains how awkward a person I was in my years growing up. I wasn't quite myself. 

Sure it'll hurt when someone calls me a handsome young man. Sure it'll bother me that I don't appear like a girl. Sure it'll be bittersweet looking at transition timelines of happy people. But I finally have a plan. After jumping out of high school (2014), completely clueless for two years, I finally have a plan and I know what lies ahead. I know sometimes plans go astray, but all I can do is dream and hope for a better tomorrow. 

Thank you all, for always being there. "

SoyProductsThrowaway,asktransgender,Does eating soy products during HRT lessen the effectiveness of estrogen?,"Soybeans have weak phytoestrogens, mainly genistein. There is a lot of concern that these phytoestrogens could compete for estrogen receptors and ruin HRT. However, genistein has a much higher affinity for estrogen receptor beta than estrogen receptor alpha. These are the 2 types of estrogen receptors. Estrogen receptor alpha is the one we all know and love, which is responsible for physical secondary sex characteristics in HRT. It's found in the breasts, growth plates, and zones of estrogenic fat growth. While estrogen receptor beta is mainly found in the uterus (which we don't have) and not in the breasts.

So, can I start eating soy products again? I REALLY miss eating tofu."

Now they're due back in a few hours and I don't think I can go back to hiding when I'm at home. 

They're both cis men who know practically nothing about trans people and the idea of coming out is terrifying, but when I think about having to be not myself now that I'm used to doing it I'm getting close to breaking down. I want to do it and be able to keep presenting as who I am, but I'm not sure I can bring myself to. I don't even know how I'd break it to them; do I send them a message ahead of time or wait for them to come through the door and say ""Hi, I'm a girl now"" or do something else entirely?

I'm honestly completely torn. This is what I've been building myself up to for months, but now that the opportunity has come it's harder than I thought it would be to just go through with it. If anyone has any pearls of wisdom that would be most appreciated right now. "

PennyLisa,asktransgender,Fat redistribution IRL,"So I know about the [chart](http://i.imgur.com/OBjQy5Z.jpg) of HRT effects, but I'm kinda wondering something. 

At the moment I'm at 14 months HRT, and really 10 of a reasonable dosage. I'm full time and everything and no one clocks me, but I'm still really struggling with dysphoria. 

What happens basically every morning I get up and see myself naked in the mirror and kinda wanna die. My body shape is just so dudely / in-between. Well this is at least in my eyes, might all be body dysmorphia I really can't tell. Once I've got clothes on and stuff it's better, but it's often enough to really mess with me. I routinely wear [hip padding](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/TRANSGENDER-PADDED-BUTT-HIP-ENHANCER-PANTIES-SHAPER-UNDERWEAR-CROSSDRESSER-PANTY-/401182933517) to give me extra hips, so that helps. I'd really reccomend these to anyone in this situation, I tried a few different ones off ebay and these ones were the best. They're pretty cheap too.

Anyhow, I'm thinking of going ahead and getting lipo-transfer to hips and breasts. I've considered a BA, but natural fat is more appealing to me. I'm wondering - is this a totally dumb idea? Does body contouring last?  Am I gonna get where I want to be in a year anyhow? Does surgery really actually help with dysphoria? I hope something helps cos I'm really struggling to live like this.

Kinda thinking about FFS too, but the body stuff bothers me more and I don't think FFS is [really needed](http://imgur.com/BiNjQRZ)."

Mistress_Impervious,asktransgender,Getting flustered,"Hey there!

So for the past few months I have felt super uncomfortable about sexuality and stuff. But not in a normal way?

Basically I like men, and I'm a trans woman. Pre hrt and stuff, and don't dress femme as to not piss off my parents. So I look like a straight male, and am perceived as one. 

But in public there is the occasional girl who will hit on me, very obviously, and I will stray away very uncomfortably. I used to be a ""straight male"" and have been in a few relationships, but they've always ended because I was ""more sensitive than a woman"". I feel like I'm throwing away opportunity by ignoring these girls? By opportunity I mean friendship, not a relationship.  

Tl:dr 
Trans girl likes men; Very uncomfortable when women flirt with me as a guy, and feel guilty. 

Anybody else ever feel this way?"
HeyImMtF,asktransgender,Is there such a thing as a gendered insult? Am I overreacting to my friend's choice of words?,"So this may seem like a dumb question to some but this has really been bothering me lately. I have a good friend that I've known since high school (also trans feminine) who I really like hanging out with and she insists that insults can't be gendered. I am of the opposite belief and think that an insult can *easily* be gendered. We've discussed it a couple of times at length but we always end up agreeing to disagree. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem and I wouldn't want to bring it up with her again but she's kind of been getting under my skin with it lately. Whenever we're doing something that has a degree of competition to it or if I do something she doesn't like, more often than not, I get called a dick. I consider this to be an insult with *heavy* masculine connotation to it. Yet whenever our mutual friend is over who is a cis female, I never hear any insults that I would consider masculine go her way, only ones with (in my opinion) female connotation to them. It makes me feel really shitty and like she's subconsciously (or maybe even intentionally) gendering me male still so she uses the words she does and hides behind her stance of, ""Insults can't be gendered,"" to justify what she's doing. It happened the other night in the middle of a game of YGO and I just went really quiet for the rest of the match and left as soon as we were done with it even though I was having a great time beforehand.

I want to know what /r/asktransgender thinks of this. Am I being too sensitive or is this something that other people would be bothered by as well? I would think that because my friend is also trans and knows how awful it feels to be misgendered that she would maybe listen to my concerns, see them from my point of view, and try to be better about this whole thing. But that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon."
Blairnatalie,asktransgender,finally got my Waist trainer in the mail...,"Heyyo, so I ordered a Waist trainer and I finally got it. Figured I'd give it a shot and see if I notice any results. I was also curious, would anyone like me to keep progress and post as the ""waist training timeline"" moves along??

Tomorrow I'll be starting a 7 -day trial type deal... after doing alot of homework I've put together a safe, but rather pushy way to see how it all works.

Let's just say tomorrow I'll start off with 2-3 hrs, and every day I'll tack on 2 hrs until I hit 8 daily. Coupled with basic excercises/stretches starting on the second day, I should see results by the 7th. 

Let me know if you'd like me to keep photos of progress!! I'd be happy to help others realise this a safe way to shape a waist... if done proper! ! "

wrethlig,asktransgender,Pope Francis correctly genders trans man,"Ok, so Pope Francis is in the news for decrying gender theory, saying it's bad for kids yadda yadda yadda. But here's an interesting little tidbit I found while I was reading [the story](https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2016/10/02/pope-says-walk-trans-persons-fight-gender-theory/):

&gt;The pope also spoke about having received a letter from a Spanish person who was **born a girl but, as a child, felt like a man.** This person told Francis that he had told his mother he wanted to have his sex reassigned, but the mother asked him to wait until after her death.

&gt;Eventually, the person had a sex-reorientation surgery, and went to the local bishop, who, Francis said, could perhaps have been seen as “wasting time to accompany this man.”

&gt;**“He who was a she, but is a he,”** Francis said, referring to the trans person accompanied by the bishop, actually wrote to the pope last year, saying that it’d be a great consolation for him to visit the pope with his wife.

Interesting to see that the Pope is calling the transgender man by his correct pronouns. Maybe more Catholics can follow his example, even if they don't want to accept us fully."

First time I'd seen them as a girl, but it couldn't have been a more supportive environment.

After I played ""dead parents"" on one of them (who watched his dad die last year), I braced for the inevitable karmic retribution. It came, and it was magical. My black card was ""Uh, guys, I know this was my idea, but I'm starting to have second thoughts about ____."" That same dude played ""estrogen.""

Obviously, this is a lot for me to take in and think about, I'm going to start by learning as much I can about being GenderFluid, but there's one question I've had bothering me since I woke up this morning, and that's, 'What do I do with this information?' It may sound like a kinda silly thing to ask, but I seriously do not know what to do now that I know this about myself.


I came here since I don't know anyone who has experience with this sort of thing. Really, any advice would help

PotHead96,asktransgender,I want to understand how people in this community feel. Help me understand :),"Hey, just to start off, since I know people in every minority face discrimination and prejudice by a great number of people (and probably nowadays the trans community is one that is particularly hurt by this atrocity of human behavior) I want to clarify that I am completely  supportive of doing anything in your power (that doesn't hurt other people) that will make you feel happier with your life and yourself.

I sympathize with the trans community and wholeheartedly wish for there to be a complete social acceptance of all gender identities. I made this post only to understand what it's like to be a transgender person so I can fully empathize, because I like to be able to put myself in other people's shoes.

I've always been confused as to what it means to feel like you belong to another gender. I've always thought it had nothing to do with genitals themselves but more with gender roles, so it's confusing to me why one would feel like they belong to a different gender instead of thinking that gender stereotypes and gender roles are useless and prejudicial and that one should behave in whichever way they pleased without that having anything to do with the reproductive organs you possess.

I'd like to be further educated on this, so I'd love to know how you feel! Sorry if I offended anyone in any way, I know it's a sensible subject and I'm speaking from ignorance.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses, I'm glad you were tolerant of my ignorance, because it helped me learn a lot about how gender dysphoria feels, which helped me empathize a lot more with this community. I hope we can one day live in a world where there is no prejudice, and I will do everything in my power to educate those around me that speak from ignorance and not from hate so that they too can view this issue as something we ought to change society's view on. I wish you the best!"
lostwithnomap,asktransgender,Did anybody have reservations about getting rid of a masculine trait like a beard?,"I recently told my girlfriend (cis female) that I was recently learning certain things about myself, and asked if I could try wearing some of her clothes, just to see how it feels. We're about the same size so most of her stuff fits me alright, and I love wearing tights, for example, though obvious stuff like dresses are too far for me right now because I don't look feminine– I could only wear dresses if I was already transitioned (if that's what I'm potentially learning I want to do).

There are a lot of things I would consider wearing if I didn't have a beard, or chest hair, but my beard is very important to my identity, not as a man but as...me. Almost nobody knows what I look like without one, and I don't even know what I would look like without it. It makes me feel less vulnerable, and I have it for the same reason I wear jackets and hoodies all the time: I'm lazy, and it protects me. Plus my girlfriend really likes it...

But when I wear really obvious feminine things like dresses, my beard sticks out like a sore thumb and destroys the effect. I can't really even enjoy myself in them. 

Has anybody else had an experience like this? Does this mean I'm not committed enough? That the desire isn't strong enough in me and thus it's just a kink, a fantasy?

ryninsin4,asktransgender,"My dad keeps insisting that I [16F] am transgender, when I am clearly not, and it's got out of control. (Warning, long post)","I'm 16, and for the past month or so my dad has been pressurising me to have gender reassignment surgery. He's been ranting on and on at me about why I should have one, giving reasons why and where etc. and has threatened to disown me if I don't have it. He keeps insisting I'm really denying being male inside and am just pretending to be female.

He'd even bought me binders from Amazon and told me I had to wear them and that he hated my breasts (which are large, but not a huge size, I don't have back pain because of my breasts)

I'm 16, female (born female), cisgender, and live in Vancouver.

I've got one sister, she's 22 but she lives away from home in Toronto. 

I told her about it over Skype and she was so horrified she insisted that she'd come over and speak to him.

I don't want to have gender reassignment; I am a woman and that's who I am. 
I've nothing against FTM transsexuals, if people want a gender reassignment it's their business, I don't judge.

My mother was furious. She spoke to him about it but he insisted ""I WILL GET MY DAUGHTER TO BECOME A MAN, WHATEVER THE FUCKING HELL IT TAKES!""

She said to him that I can make her own decisions, and told him that I'm happy with who I am.

I've tried telling my dad that this is not going to happen, I'm happy with myself and my gender identity, but to no avail. He's steadfast in his belief that I need to have a sex-change. Even a heart-to-heart talk with him failed - he just would not stop and was unrepentant about why I should have a sex-change to become a man.

My dad insisted ""I'm gonna drive you to a gender reassignment clinic, you're gonna tell them that you identify as male, and do anything to get a diagnosis of transgender."" and then he said ""You'll make a trendy hot gay guy once you have a sex-change.""

My dad just won't stop ranting and has never physically threatened me over this, only verbally.

Isn't his behaviour just a form of bullying, only on a larger scale than typical bullying?

About the only time I feel happy is when I'm either in school studying (a peaceful diversion from this) or with my sister, yet it seems like there's no way out.

I can't really move out of home as I'm 16, and financial reasons etc. yet I need to resolve this situation.

I cannot deal with this; I have no problems with transgender people or LGBT people but my dad does, and he keeps insisting I'm transgender when I'm not.

I suspect he resents the fact my mother couldn't have more kids, my own birth was a difficult one for doctors, my mum was told at the time another pregnancy could kill her (when I was a young kid my mum was telling me how I was born) and he probably resents her for not giving him a son.

What should I do to deal with this situation? Need your advice"

im_really_monica,asktransgender,Came out to my parents (UPDATE),"Yesterday, they were really not okay at all. They were saying that they'd never get used to this, they didn't know if they could continue to have a relationship with me, etc. Thankfully, my sister was there to talk with them and help them begin to process all this, and apparently it really helped.

I made my Sunday phone call this morning like I do every week, not knowing what to expect. They were really great. My mother, particularly, admitted that she doesn't know much about trans because people her age just weren't exposed to it. She asked me if it was okay if they slipped up and called me by my deadname every so often. I mean, they knew me by that name for 46 freakin' years--of course they are going to slip. I can't get mad at them for honest mistakes, and I know they will make them. She asked about my name change process, how it will all play out at work, my hormones, how my in-laws are taking it, can you send pictures, when do I get to see you, etc. But she told me that she loves and supports me and that all her kids are wonderful in their own way. For someone who's 79 and conservative, she really came through. My dad admitted he was struggling, and he ended the conversation with his signature, ""Take care, big guy,"" but I know he's working through this in his own way.

Staying alone with that feeling too long and its starting to feel toxic. I'm avoiding going out for the past month or so because I'm feeling kinda really ashamed for having to do any of this. If the only thing that allows me to be known as my gender is just some items, what does that say about me? How much do other trans people who don't need to do any of this look down on me?

I've always adored androgyny. It's like a physical expression of the masculine and feminine as one, and that's beautiful to me.  

I've also been much more attracted to butchier or boyish women; women whose external appearance and personality are more alpha and assertive.  

I always worry, though, that a butch cis lesbian would never be interested in being with a trans woman. I'm not opposed to dating a trans woman, but we're still a minority in social environments; so, we're less likely to run into each other.  

I love a more feminine aesthetic, but I found that femme girls and I don't have the best chemistry.  

Some will ask, *""if you like boyish girls, why don't you like guys?""* Because however she chooses to express herself it doesn't change the fact that she's a woman. There are things that are exclusively feminine that men may not intuitively or innately feel or express, particularly in nuances of affection. Plus, the male form just doesn't appeal to me.

CosmicMina,asktransgender,Help with hormones,"Hi, I am asking for advice from those who have a better idea about this than me.

My situation is a little weird as I am a Canadian who has lived and worked in Seoul for several years. I have managed to track down an American psychiatrist and received my assessment for GID. I then managed to make contact with one of the only doctors here that serves the trans community (if not the only).

Yesterday I started HRT, YAY! However, the doctor was pretty clear that he was not an endo and he was really a surgeon. This led me to wonder about his prescriptions. I am confident the injectable estrogen he prescribed me conforms to normal clinical doses(20mg every two weeks). I am however concerned about Androcur. He started me on 100mg. Though I had to ask him for antiandrogens. He told me that he usually only prescribes transwomen estrogen. 

I suppose my question is should I have asked for spironolactone? The whole process was a little surreal at the time of the meeting and I didn't really have my wits about me so I didn't ask. I just don't want liver failure.

Anyway, thank you for any insight. I have to go back to the clinic after work today to pick up some more pills as they didn't have enough. I may be able to inquire.

Im a new poster here, but a long time lurker. This sub has been a really helpful resource to me and I wish to thank everyone that has contributed to it ☺


I was nine when I was adopted. My mom couldn't make ends meet for herself, let alone my siblings and I, so she turned to an adoption agency for help. My siblings and I made it into the same home, thankfully, but unfortunately our new parents were ultra conservative and strict. I quickly realized I could not be truly me around them, so I withdrew deep into the closet and tried to fit their mould. It was rough! At 18, I finally moved out, but it took me 4 years to sort myself out and find healing for all I went through.

Sometimes I wonder if I had stayed with my birth mom how things would be different. I likely would have started my transition at least 10 years sooner (Mom was the first person I came out to).


So how did adoption affect your transition? How does your tale compare to mine? If you tried to contact your birth parents, did you do it before or after your transition?"

What I'm talking about is:

Unworthiness: I often feel as though I am unworthy of my gender based on my body.

Faking everything: Throughout my whole life, I have, in many ways, acted like my birth sex rather then the gender I identify as. But not because I liked that, no I mostly hated it, I just acted like that because I thought everyone else was the same; just acting to be ""cool"" or whatever.

The_Scherznator,asktransgender,How do I just accept myself for who I am? (LONG),"This post has been a long time coming. At the age of 22, I feel stuck. Some days are a struggle to get out of bed, while other days seem to drag on forever. I am fairly certain that I am trans (MtF). There have been signs of if for over a decade. When I was 12 I would regularly steal maxi pads from my mother to wear them in my underwear. I knew I didn't need them, but it felt right.  When I was in early high-school, I took one of her bras so I could wear it when I had the house to myself.  Once I could drive, I went out and bought my own.  I grew my hair out because it made me feel girly, but ended up buzzing it short last year to try to make myself feel more manly. I have always gone through cycles of browsing trans support sites, feminization tips, and other trans issues. I even spent a week learning about SRS. Then there would be weeks where I would completely loose interest in any of that stuff. I had always thought it was some cross dressing fetish, or that I would grow out of it. I'm not so sure anymore. Some days are unbelievably depressing, but for seemingly no reason. By all accounts I should be very happy with my life. I have a good loving family who, even though they are not the most LGBT friendly people in the world, have given me more than I can ever repay them. I have a decent job for being a college student, and promising academic ambitions. I should be happy but something is missing. There are days where I wonder what I am missing. At first I thought it was just the lack of a significant other, but the sadness feels like more than just loneliness. It feels deeper and more fundamental. A couple weeks ago I decided to paint my toenails. I was going through a phase I am all too familiar with. The one where you need to express yourself in a feminine way, or you will explode. After I painted them and looked down at my feet, I felt something. I can't say for sure what it was, but it made me smile. Right there, looking at my bright pink (it was technically fuchsia) toenails on my size 13 feet, it hit me. I knew I would be happier as a girl. The thought of wanting to be a girl is not new to me, I've thought it many times before. There have been many times where I thought I would rather be a girl, but couldn't say why. I had no real reason for wanting to be a girl, I just thought it would somehow make me happy. For the next couple weeks, every time I was alone for an extended period of time I would look down at my feet and smile at what I had done. Then I saw my fingernails. I wanted so badly to paint them the same color, but knew I couldn't. Sometime at the beginning of those couple weeks I began wearing panties full time. I also sat on the toilet every time I had to pee, regardless of whether I was at home or at work. For those few weeks, I didn't have ""one of those days"". I felt happier, not 100%, but better. A few days ago I took the nail polish off because of an ingrown nail I needed to fix. I also stopped wearing panties and started standing to pee. At that point I figured ""the phase"" was over and I can go back to being my normal male self, but the feelings aren't going away this time. It feels like something inside me has been awakened. I often look in the mirror, and something feels off. I'm not happy with my body. There are obvious things I want changed, such as wanting to loose a few pounds or needing to shave, but something else is off. I know I have always wanted a slightly feminine body. I never liked the idea of a muscly masculine body with broad shoulders and a straight waist. I always wanted to be skinny, but fit. I just thought it looked cuter. I have been lurking on this sub for a week or so now. I have seen what is possible through hormones, and I want it. I don't hate my genitals like some here. I'm fine with them being the way they are, but the rest of me feels off. I like the idea of having breasts, hips, a soft face and a bubbly butt. To be clear, I would rather have female genitalia, but I'm not comfortable with such invasive (and expensive) surgery to actually change what I have. The whole hypothetical ""button scenario"" often plays in my head. I would push the button. Even after all this, I still have doubt. There is a significant part of me that can't accept the fact that I am trans. How do/did you overcome that part of you that is denying the rest of you happiness? How do you make peace with the idea that one day, you may lose family over this? How do you move past the doubt that you aren't actually trans? How do you stop caring so much about what others think of you? I know it will be a couple years before I can even consider transitioning, but what are some small, low-key things I can do to make myself feel more feminine?

If you have made it this far, you have my sincerest thanks."
Skyewarn72,asktransgender,So how do you prefer telling someone you are dating that you are trans and they play the deception card?,Just like the title says.  How do you deal with someone confront you about you decieving them because you didnt say up front?  I know everyone is going to have a different opinion on dating do's/dont but once it's done how would you approach it?
throwaway7123456777,asktransgender,I'm pretty sure I'm transgender. I just don't think I want to be.,"Just as the title says. In the past few days I started to look into transgenderism and the description of some articles are exactly how I've felt (like group 3 in this article is scary accurate: http://goo.gl/N9Zm47). I started cross dressing in secret and when I know I won't be caught around two years ago, and wanted to for around four when I found out it was a thing. And I thought that was it; I never considered being transgender an option (until a few days ago). I mean, I remember fantasies all the way back to like kindergarten and second grade of all the women I know making me into a girl to be ""one of them"" or something and I just thought it was a weird thing all little kids thought about, but now it's just another piece of evidence stacking up that I'm transgender. It's just so surreal, I feel like this is just some dream I'm supposed to wake from soon. And I really just want to wake up from it.

So I'm pretty sure I'm trans, but it's just I don't think I want to be, or maybe I'm just in denial; I don't know. It's just the thought of telling my family scares me to death. I'm 17 and I have an older brother who is my best friend and I feel like he would accept it, but he would still look at me like a different person. My younger sister and I have an alright relationship and I'm pretty sure she would accept me also, but she's the one I'm least worried about, honestly. My mom and, especially, my dad would honestly probably be shell shocked, all of my  immediate family would, just them in particular. I think my dad (he picks favorites, it's unfortunate. I'm the favorite to him :/) thinks I'm ""more of man"" than my older brother because I like to watch sports with him and I run cross country and work out and lift weights and shit and I'm pretty successful at that and my brother never did and I'm academically better than my brother was. The cross country team is another concern because we're like family and talk about meeting up after we all graduate, but still my main concern is my family. I feel like they wouldn't believe me. Everyone's pretty liberal but my parents were raised Catholic and me and my sister are even confirmed Catholics (brother is an atheist) so the extended family would be even more shocked (and maybe never understand) because they are all less liberal. I just can't believe it, myself, that I'm transgender. Everything points to it and makes sense to me, but I just don't want my life to get... Destroyed by it. I want everyone to see me as myself, and I want to get married and have kids with that  girl, and I want a ""normal"" life, but I just feel like being trans changes all of that. I could go all my life as a male but I know I'd end up hating it later in life based off of others experiences so I'm just so confused on what to do, and I'm so... Fucking terrified of the rest of my life. "

almostoneofthegirls,asktransgender,struggling to move forward,"hi-
I'm having a hard time finding the strength to start my transition, just looking for any advice or encouragement.

I'm pre-everything, except for about three sessions with a gender therapist. at first seeing her felt amazing, she is the first and still only person I have come out to not anonymously online and talking about my gender issues openly did feel really great. however, I missed one session last week due to a work commitment and now I am finding the idea of going back to see her this week very difficult. 

I feel a constant pendulum swinging back and forth inside of me. one one hand, I desperately want to start a medical transition. I want to take hrt, get laser hair removal, and eventually srs... like as soon as possible. I would get srs tomorrow if they'd let me. on the other hand,  transitioning socially seems like the most difficult thing in the world. I know my authentic self is a female self (I am AMAB MTF), but the idea of changing myself also seems so inauthentic... like I'd be putting on a performance. even though I have a constant anxiety and discomfort with my body, I also am at ease most of the time interacting with the world. 
My friends for example, are all very progressive good, kind, people but even still asking them to treat me differently, as a woman, seems insurmountable. last night I got drinks with a handful of close friends and a few references to transgender people came up just as topics of conversation and I was so happy to hear everybody talking about that stuff totally respectfully and down and whatever... theoretically it would have been a perfect time for me to say that I am questioning my gender and may even be starting hormones in the near future but it just seemed like a million miles away from my reality. 

ever since I started therapy and have been able to articulate my feelings more I've thought of a little test to give myself as I consider transitioning (which is all day). I pause and reflect on the moment I'm in and ask myself ""how would this be different if I was different"", sometimes, at work for example, it would be fine if I was different. maybe my boss would make some awkward comment or joke but it wouldn't be from a place of hate, he's an alright guy. my coworkers wouldn't care in fact they would probably think it's cool. but then I find myself goofing around with my friends cracking jokes and then I think how difficult it would be. when you're with close friends and jokes are flying anything is fair game to be made fun of and teased about. and I love that about goofing around with friends, knowing each other and being at ease enough to joke about anything... if and when I transition those moments will be much different. I fear people in my life will be nothing but outwardly supportive, down and even curious about my transition... but they wouldn't know how to treat me, what to do with me. I guess I still don't know what to do with me. "

llamabeans123,asktransgender,Signs of transgender?,"Hello, 
I'm writing this in hopes of gaining insight from anyone who cares to help. 
I caught my boyfriend responding to craigslist transgender ads. He confessed he has struggled with watching transgender porn for a while, and believes it stems from his poor childhood experiences (without getting into too much detail)
I'm worried if I continue dating him, he will one day come out as transgender. 
He has stated he has no desire to be with men, and has never said anything about feeling like a woman on the inside. 
Can anyone tell me, what do you think watching transgender porn and talking to transgenders over craigslist might mean? Is this a phase? Or might he really be secretly wanting to come out as trans?

xerox13ster,asktransgender,Wishing I could go back in time.,"I know there are people here transitioning that are long past my time in life and are getting great results, and I'm incredibly glad that I've had the wherewithal to transition when I am and not delay it any longer, but I can't help but reflect on what could have been.

My strongest source of dysphoria is my past. I call it temporal dysphoria. I knew when I was 8 what transgender was (transsexual at the time). I knew it was possible at 12. I came out to my parents at 14, cross dressed all the time at 15. Begged my parents to start hormones at 16, almost diy'd at 17. I should have. I was always small until I hit 18. Then I shot from 5'6"" to 5'10"" and from 165lbs to 265lbs. My feet went from men's size 8 to men's size 12. 

I wish I could just close my eyes and pull my consciousness back in time to when I was a teenager and diy behind my parent's backs--leaving this timeline to wither and die as I become who I was meant to be the first time around.

Instead I settle for listening to the music I listened to as a teen when I had bad dysphoria and pulling my hood up like I'm 16 again. It's the same hoodie I had then, too. The same hoodie, the same headphones and the same Zune covered up with the same blanket.

I close my eyes and instead of being homeless in the fetal position in a bucket seat, I'm back in my twin bed. Maybe one day I'll focus on it so hard, I'll open my eyes to see my bedroom instead. I can hope anyway.

~~The playlist, in case anyone wants it.~~ Never mind. I'm not sure there's a way to share it without essentially doxxing myself."
TinaThrowaway00,asktransgender,How do I/How did you come out to my/your parents?,"Ill try my hardest not to ramble on, but I'm a 16 year old white male living in Australia. Recently I have thought long and hard and I'm 90% sure I'm trans, with the help of you guys (thanks!!).

My mind has been racing back and fourth over who I am and I'm losing concentration and sleep. So I've decided that whether I'm trans or not, I need to open up to and talk my parents. Before you say it, no I'm not comfortable enough to open up about this to my friends and if I do transition, I'd do so stealthily.

My parents are open, non-religious and want what is best for me, leading me to believe that they will be accepting and supporting. But I'm super shy and anxious, leading it to still being a world of pain.

I know I'm rushing through this a little, but I already can't think straight in any of my classes. Plus, the best time I'll physically ever have is walking straight past me and I don't want to miss the bus I so passionatly want to hop aboard.

Seeing as you lot helped me the first time, I'm hoping you can once again. So, how should I open up if I'm so scared? And I'd love to hear all your stories about how you opened up to people that are close to you.

d2throaway,asktransgender,"(MTF) I am 99% sure I am trans, but I always doubt myself no matter what. Please help.","Hi my name is Blake, I'm 18 years old and as of recently I have been learning more and more about Transgender people, I knew about it for years of course but never saw myself as one, I have a lot of anxiety problems and dealt with depression in the past, I feel like I have a poor self body image too, I hate growing facial hair it looks ugly I feel ugly when I grow it, this isn't the reason why I think I am trans but it is definitely a factor for me. 

When I imagine myself as being a female I think of myself as being happier, I feel excited and extremely scared at the same. Excited because I feel like for once in my life I finally figured out why I had self esteem issues and self doubt, and severe anxiety and racing thoughts (I heard this is more common with girls), etc. I am at the same time extremely scared at the same time because I am anxious to see what I would look like after fully transitioning, Would I be pretty? I really hope so and I feel like I would be really sad if I wasn't. [What I look like now.](http://imgur.com/a/IwTgL) 

I am only attracted to girls, never been in a relationship or even had a kiss, so a kissless virgin, I always was shy and reserved but ofc when I am around people I am comfortable with I am louder. When I look at other girls I envy them, it sounds so bad when I think about it, but I wish I was them. Since I've been thinking about this everytime I talk I hate how deep my voice is. I hate that I never questioned my gender earlier in life but at the same time that would've made bullying in school even worse.

I really don't know what to do. I didn't really tell anyone besides a few transgender friends I have online, and I kinda hinted to my grandmother over text with a hypothetical question about switching sexes, and she said if I was really a female she would be totally okay with it, despite her saying racist and transphobic things in the past... I am glad I at least put it in one family members head. I do not want to tell my mom(who I live with) or anyone else yet. 

I told my mom I want to see a therapist and I am looking up therapists that deal with transgender people and seeing if that will help and eventually leading to doing HRT. 

I am so anxious and scared because I never really questioned it until now. Do any of you relate to my situation or my feelings? "

multicolor321,asktransgender,I came out to my mom. It went okay,"So I had to come home from college for the weekend for an emergency. I was planning coming home in a few weeks anyway to tell the parents I'm trans, but I found a good time to tell my mom so I just did it on a whim.

It went better than expected. She's super Southern Baptist so I'd thought she'd get mad. But she said she'd accept whatever decision I made and would love me regardless. No kicking out of the house or cutting off financially.

She was still super confused though and it made me feel bad that I couldn't make her understand. She's scared I'm making the wrong decision and believes that God wouldn't make me a man if he wanted me to be a woman. I think she's stuck between wanting me not to transition and wanting to respect what's right for me.

I'm just numb to deciding what to do next. I didn't have the emotional energy to tell my dad, so she wants to tell him after I leave. I kinda wanted to tell him in person but he just needs to know this if I'm going to start transitioning soon. I told her it's okay to tell him. Personally I'm just reluctant to continue.

glitterwrists,asktransgender,"My dad is so two faced, and it's building a lot of resentment.","I came out officially a few months ago through a post on Facebook. Most of my family was supportive. My mom commented on the post and told me to do what my heart tells me, and that she's here for me. My dad didn't interact with the post of all, but made his own post about the important of accepting new concepts. Figured that was directed towards me, right? He ended the post by talking about how we're all on Earth together, and it's time we all learn to love one another. Cool.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My younger sister has just entered high school and has been doing some soul searching. I've noticed through social media that she's been dressing in more ""boyish"" clothes at school, and that she's been using a male nickname at school. I messaged her asking if she wanted me to use different pronouns for her, and she said not to for now. She acknowledged it was just some experimentation, and I let her know I support her 100% and she can come to me with any questions.

Well, my dad heard one of her friends use her nickname and he lost his shit. He told her she's tearing the household apart, and threatened to divorce my mom over it (??). He told my sister she needs ""to figure out what the fuck she's going to be, and she'd better choose wisely"". They live in another state and I would've given anything to be there. My sister is horrified my dad will walk out, and now refuses to go by her nickname or wear anything less than uber feminine. I can't call her by the nickname when I message her, because my dad reads all of her messages now. She's clearly traumatized. One of her friends told me she almost passed out at school due to stress, and they're very concerned.

I'm visiting my family mid-November, and my dad keeps trying to talk to me. He called me tonight and I let it go to voicemail. He referred to me by my dead name in every other sentence, and I'm not calling him back. He told me he's been thinking about me a lot and that he loves me with all of his heart, but I can't believe him. The way he has treated my sister shows what he really thinks of the trans* community, and it's disgusting. My grandparents on his side refuse to use my new name, and I've cut contact with them as well.

&gt; this was made possible by pushing religions that disapprove of homosexual behavior, and even killing openly transgender people, and many other means.

&gt; transgender people got demonized and had to go into hiding or never even think of themselves as transgender.

&gt; there were secret groups that pushed this oppression because they actually thought they could rule the world (or at least be stronger than the next country) when transgender people try to live on the wrong side. This obviously was hard to believe but she tried to fill me in.

&gt; these groups knew that when transgender people can't live as what they feel inside, they will not be able to live naturally, always trying to hide who they are, trying to be what they are not.

&gt; this causes transgender people brains to develop or operate in a drastically different manner than that of cis humans, where cis humans can follow their emotions, feelings and instincts, transgender people had to suppress these.

&gt; and here comes the reason why this could profit anyone, according to her these ""enslaved"" brains that don't follow their instincts, feelings, love and emotion are left with a void that encourages dry logical thinking, the kind of thinking one has to do when solving math problems or similar things.

&gt; so basically oppressing transgender people was done by these secret groups to have a part of the population that lives only to learn and work with their heads, and so in turn pushing technology. Keep in mind we're still talking about hundreds of years ago.

&gt; this was all fine and good (for everyone but transgender people) and went on for many many years. 

&gt; until other people realized that something unnatural was going on in the world (about 100 or more years ago). And some even realized that it had to do with with transgender people. Some saw that what was happening was not good for humanity and the world (the building of more and more machines, people living without love). Others saw an opportunity to start industries powered by the enslaved transgender humans. Even whole countries saw an opportunity in keeping transgender people enslaved to enlarge their military power. All this was happening without most of the population realizing what was going on.

I will leave out some stuff she said about the second world war and the cold war (cause it got seriously scary and weird here), but one thing she said was that these wars forced opposing nations to keep transgender people oppressed so the influx of cutting edge technology wouldn't be stopped.

&gt; She also said that the people who started the oppression of transgender people completely lost control of their experiment, and that today's secret groups that control the transgender ""machine"" are on one hand successors to the old secret groups that lost most of their power but still try to hold the world in their grip, and a new group that consists of the most powerful heads of the biggest industries and countries in the world. 

&gt; She also said that recently another group has emerged, which consists partly of actual transgender people who got extremely powerful in their lives and now want to take revenge on humanity for enslaving transgender people by enslaving all of humanity in their system of machines and money.

&gt; She says almost the complete planet is in the hands of these groups and that there is probably nothing the rest of humanity can do to stop them.

&gt; There are humans that are actively fighting this new world order, but it's hardly possible. They do this by for example producing songs that secretly speak out to transgender people, trying to reach them and encourage them to transition. She says this fight is now already going on for centuries, but it's only now getting better. 

&gt; She says that almost every song on the radio nowadays is secretly about transgender people in the hopes to change their ways from robotic zombie dedicating their lives to technology, to compassionate, loving humans.
She says that these secret messages are also in video games (as examples she gave starcraft, league of legends, Dota 2 and Fallout 4. All this to make people transition and stop the new world order.

So here is my question: Is she as crazy as this sounds or is there truth to it?"

runebabb,asktransgender,Questioning transfemme person,Hey! So the past couple years I've been toying with gender and originally identified as gender fluid. However the beginning of this year I had a thought that I was trans and started exclusively wearing girl's clothes and wearing full face makeup. I still came off as male/androgynous because of my hair and voice and body which I was fairly okay with as long as I was just presenting femme. However I came back to being trans recently and even came out to my family. I've been experiencing a lot of dysphoria since then in terms of thinking about transitioning because I feel I'll never pass. And some days I don't mind not passing like I said before. I don't know if my dysphoria is caused by me forcing myself into the binary transgirl identity or it's actual dysphoria. I have electrolysis appointments setup and a consult to start hrt in a month so I've already taken some steps but I feel like the idea of starting hrt is scaring me. Has anyone else experienced this? It also doesn't help that I have a transguy friend who's been on hrt for a while tell me only 2 genders exist so I feel like I've been internalizing his feelings and making myself more uncomfortable in the process. I'm just having an identity crisis and needed some kind of guidance or opinions on this!! Thank u!

He said ""I should have told you before, but I'm trans too"". I didn't know what to say. I thanked them for calling me and told them that I needed some time to process everything. That was a couple hours ago.

I came out to my parents about 9 months ago. They reacted more positively than I could've ever imagined and my younger brother of two years seemed indifferent. I went to therapy, I found an endo, and I started HRT. Life began to make sense for the first time in a long time... and now I don't know. This was the last thing that I was expecting. I'm in shock. How is this even possible? The chances of this happening must be minuscule. We have no other siblings. Trans, 2 out of 2. This is just... crazy.

Giving this new information I have to go back and rethink my opinions and position on this topic. Thank you for helping me become a better and more educated person. Good day.**

I originally made a video about it on youtube, but my friend pointed out that I should just ask reddit. 
So here is the transcript:

So here's the question, if you are a transgender, and for the sake of the example, let's say that you were born a man and went through whatever surgeries and took whatever hormones you had to take to make yourself look like a woman. 

Let's say that you are that, how do you reconcile the fact that I can scientifically, objectively prove that you are a man and were born a man? Because I can do that quite easily simply by taking a DNA swab off of you and taking it to the lab. 

And what I will see, is that even though you claim to be a woman you have X and Y chromosomes, which are the sex determining chromosomes and are a testament of the fact that you are a man, at least genetically, and you were born a man. 

so how do you reconcile that? do you explain it away as the difference between sex and gender, so even though you are a male by sex you are a woman by gender? And if that is your argument, which it might not be, I don't know, but if it is, then does that mean you maybe have a stereotype of how a woman should be and you want to be associated with that with that stereotype.


If I had to guess what the answer is, I would guess this is more of a self image type of thing. 
It's about looking in the mirror and thinking that the outside doesn't reflect the inside. And that I can, if not relate to, at least understand a lot better. 

But then my question will be, do you think people should be obligated to see and treat you as a woman just because you feel like one? 

Because my problem with that is, I can objectively prove that you are a male by sex through looking at your DNA.

How can you prove to me that you are a woman by gender? What is the metric you use to measure gender? and if there isn’t such metric and everyone can be whatever gender they profess to be, whenever they want, why should anyone be obligated to respect that?


I don’t mean to offend anyone by this line of questioning. 

I am asking these questions because I am genuinely curious about your opinions and thought process. 


Hopefully we can have a productive conversation."
misskb82,asktransgender,End of HRT effects,"Saw my Endo yesterday and he said that my development has stopped at Tanner stage 2. Anyone had this? I've literally had no breast growth other than the area becoming slightly soft. This is after over 2.5 years HRT.

Throwaway14120310957,asktransgender,The Wrong Childhood? [21 MTF],"Hey, this might be a little bit of a ranty or controversial post, but I see this phrase come up a lot, and, as a trans person, it more confuses me than anything. I see trans people lamenting having the ""wrong childhood."" I don't quite understand what this means. Growing up I had a child's childhood. I got to be innocent, play dress up, imagination games, that sort of thing, and I was a perfectly happy kid. My parents were pretty good about not forcing /any/ gender stereotypes on me, and I was very skeptical of them from the start.

Given the lack of sex characteristics, the ""gender"" of one's childhood is just a conglomeration of stereotypes and expectations, and as best I can tell all growing up with the ""wrong"" childhood did to me was a couple idiosycrasies between me and the stereotype of an adult woman (I don't wear makeup ever and I'm sometimes poorly dressed). It's a small inconvenience in my adult life but being exposed to the ""wrong"" stereotypes is nothing traumatic.

The phrase ""The Wrong Puberty"" makes a ton more sense to me. Male puberty fucked me up, my family's adamant refusal to give puberty blockers or anti-androgens was heartbreaking and traumatic and their incessant need to try to coax me to ""accept"" my male puberty and body absolutely devastated me. Male puberty and my reactions to it was probably the worst time in my life, and I'm glad I'm getting the damage done by it fixed more and more as time goes on.

I just don't comprehend how getting one set of stereotypes over another arbitrarily forced on you as a kid is especially bad, or at least any worse than having stereotypes forced on you at all. Can anyone explain? Is this not what people mean when they say they had the wrong childhood? Or do people mean childhood up through puberty?"

rplesti,asktransgender,Is there more to variable HRT effectiveness than meets the eye?,"HRT is complicated.  It all makes me want to take up biochemistry.

Anyway, I've noticed that everyone (hyperbole) treats HRT as a thing they started at a set date and compares that date against other people's time on the same HRT.  Someone will be on HRT for 8 months and have little change, and someone else will grow B cups in a couple months.  I think there's reason to believe the variability isn't ALL genetic.

(The examples are MTF as that's what I am, and MTF tend to have a bit more trouble with hormones)

1. The relationship between hormone serum level and effects is not linear.  Though there are a lot of subtle factors, it appears to be more [S-shaped](https://publications.nigms.nih.gov/medbydesign/images/ch1_doseresponse.jpg) like most pharmaceuticals.  If someone's levels are on the left side of their S for estradiol, they should see a fraction of the effects of someone on the right side of theirs.

2. It takes months for some people to even reach the necessary dose to cross the middle of the S, having had to do several adjustments before a sudden and sharp increase in pace is reached.  This throws comparisons off.

3. There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests some people are less compatible with one formulation or route of administration vs another.  One person can take a large dose of sublingual E daily and not even break 140pg/mL E, then switch to a much more normal dose of injection and jump over 50%.  [Here's a VERY interesting paper on the topic](http://www.hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Kuhl%2005%20%20Pharm%20Estro%20Progest%20Climacteric.pdf)

4. I almost hate to bring this up, but endocrinologists can be unprofessional.  Apathetic endos can't get in trouble for malpractice when someone's body doesn't change enough.  They don't have to hold a reputation like a surgeon does, where the results are directly attributable to their skill.  It's also very easy for them to underestimate how life-savingly important transition is to trans people.

YeahRightDevil,asktransgender,Having trouble Transitioning...,"I am 19 years old and in the Marine Corps. When i was in 6th grade i started realizing something wasnt right with myself. I felt feminine. I felt an emotional disconnect with my mind and my body. Im sure people have gone through the same thing, but being so young in an extremely conservative family, I thought something was wrong with me. At first I thought I was gay, but I found out eventually during the end of 8th grade going into high school about the different sexualities and realized I was bisexual. In my sophomore year I had gynecomastia due to high estrogen levels in my body and I had surgery to correct my gynecomastia and remove my breasts. I was not overweight, but the development left me uncomfortable so they were removed. Now I am getting out of the military due to medical reasons and I really want to make a transition, and would like to do so soon. Im worried that having my previous surgery will inhibit me from being able to develop breasts and its just piling onto my stress. My overall goal is to see a psychiatrist (correct me if im wrong) and sort of ""legitimize?"" my gender dysphoria. I want to be put on testosterone blockers and estrogen, and then as I progress in that transition, I would like to get top surgery. I am worried about my body hair, and in my life ive always been kind of big. I am 170 lbs, 5'10"", broad shouldered and muscular. Im worried that my previous surgery might inhibit breast implants, and that overall my current physical appearance would prevent me from passing. That means a lot to me personally... Anyway now that ive kind of described myself, can anyone tell me if theyve dealt with the same things? How you overcame them? How did you maintain your body hair or remove it, How did growing out your hair work out? Was hormones and excersize enough to remediate a masculine body type? How did breast augmentation surgery work for you? What could you do to have a more femenine voice? I envy the people with strength to come out to the world as who they are and I hope I can do the same in the future. I just feel this need to have a ""checklist"" of things that i can look into to complete a full MtF transition. Thank you so much for your time, everybody. :)"
amon_erin,asktransgender,Am I losing my mind or?,"Today is three weeks on HRT. I just took my second dose for the day and I'm not very excited about it, which is unusual for me. I know I had a bad day today, so that might be skewing my view of things, but something about today just makes me feel like this is a waste of time. I know this takes time, but not much has gotten better. I was all over the place emotionally today, even worse than usual, and at times I felt super dizzy (almost like I was drunk) and my fingers were going numb/tingling. I haven't felt that way since my first dose of HRT.

But the part that annoys me is the mood shifts. Sometimes I'm completely fine and this is clearly the right path, other times I debate with myself whether this is the right decision. I know I can stop whenever I want, but I don't really want to. If it's a matter of being right or wrong about starting HRT, I want to be right. Overall, I can say that my general sense that this was the ""right"" call is somewhat better, but that feeling shifts with the wind. I know within me that I don't want to stay as presenting/identifying as male. I don't want any of it anymore. At times I'd rather die than go back unwillingly. (I may go off after a trial run to bank sperm.)

I knew going in that this wouldn't be all sunshine and rainbows. I just want to feel like I'm enough to get what I want and not constantly question myself. It doesn't help that people don't respect my pronouns (I still present as male) and that I see people continuing to act as if there is only one way to be trans.

So am I losing my mind or is this just part of the whole process?"

shoelaze,asktransgender,"DAE rationalize their feelings for their changing body as that they were still developing, and that they would be ok once fully developed?","So all throughout puberty I hated my developing male sex characteristics, in particular body and facial hair, and later my hair loss, but told myself it was because they weren't yet fully developed and that as I reached physical maturity they, and my feelings towards them, would change, and I'd no longer have an issue. Now obviously that hasn't happened; if I hated my facial hair before now that it's darker, thicker, and tougher It's bordering on unbearable. And yet, I still sometimes think that maybe I should wait until I can grow a full beard, and I have full chest hair to see how I feel. I think this is mostly due to my Dad- he's very European, very hairy, and would often make derogatory comments whenever he'd see a man who had clearly 'manscaped'. Idk though

How did you manage the pain/swelling? Especially on the first dilate of the day.  I'm still on hydrocodone every 4 hours, but at what point could you stop pain meds?  Dilating all day makes me swollen and painful at night so I've started using ice packs again but it's making sleep hard.  Did you try muscle relaxers?

When does it get easier?  It takes 15 minutes to work up to maximum depth, and keeping it pressed in with pressure (the surgeon said I need to press forcefully, not just let it sit there) tires out my arms too.

How long can/should you go without dilating?  For example the surgeon said I don't need to dilate at night, so I sleep 8-10 hours without dilating.  When I fly home I won't be able to dilate for like 6 hours.

Thanks!  I'm literally just dilating then napping to get back energy to dilate again."
Macey008765,asktransgender,Why does this guy stare at me? Does he like me or...?,"Im 17 and just started school at a new school. I've made about two friends, great people, but i still haven't come out to anyone and I haven't started DIY hormones but I'm looking into it.

Anyway in my Biology and Maths class there's this dude: Semi-popular, tall, pretty cute, great posture, the kind of guy who would've been extremely popular if he chose to hang with the cool, disfainful kids, but chose instead to hang out with the rather unpopular kids (my friend said this is his trick to make him look even more attractive and mysterious, whatever. I get a *Simba hanging out with clumsy, clowny Timon and Pumbaa* vibe from his group). Anyway he's always staring at me whenever i run into him. Let me say it: I'm not masculine-looking in any way. I mean I don't act feminine but I look feminine. Short, skinny. My friend said if I gained a little weight in the cheeks and ass, guys would be flat-out flirting with me, which is flattering but irrelevant because I like girls (mostly) and girls don't like me with my narrow jaw and narrow nose, big eyes (which I'm extremely grateful for; good feminine genes). 

Anyway the way this dude looks at me isn't hostile or anything, it's in this way that makes me think of a cat watching a mouse: calm, steady, calculating. I'm used to guys staring though, when i was younger and first noticed it, around 14 years old i used to think they stared because they thought i was weird looking but with time, I've been able to tell that (mostly) they weren't stares of disgust or confusion but of... you know. And that's how the other guys at my school look at me: curiously, eyes occasionally darting down to my mouth. But this guy just gives me this *look*, this blank yet intense look, completely passive. It sounds creepy but for some reason im not creeped out: it doesn't look like he wants to come up and push me and call me a *faggot* (this happened once last year at my old school) whenever I look up in class or in the dining hall to see him looking at me. My friends say I should talk to him, both of them have now developed this annoying shipping thing between me and this dude, which I don't appreciate because I have my sights on someone else but will they listen ?(I love them though, i feel like they'd excitedly go through the roof if they found out I'm a trans girl ).

So has anyone else had such an experience and how did you deal with it? Maybe I'm being naive: maybe this guy is giving me the death stare and I'm sugarcoating it? Oh and this is my first post, it seems like such a great supportive community here.

I know doctors in the US basically exclusively give out Spiro, but Bica isn't banned in the same way Cypro is right? Any chance of convincing them? I eat a lot of potassium which makes me wary of Spiro, and I don't need any more frequent urinations than I already have lol.

NatLuc,asktransgender,Help with a partially supportive partner.,"Hi there, I would love some help with my partner.

I am a mid 20s MtF transgender girl, and I have been in a relationship with a truly amazing girl for almost 2 years.

She has given me so much support with being who I want to be and actually encouraged me to get out there as my true self.

I am still living as a male though for a number of reasons.

1. Because of fears of discrimination and hate crime and generally all the usual anxieties that I guess we are plagued by..

2. The other reason is that while my partner accepts I am transgender, she can only continue to be my partner as long as I don't transition. 

I am finding it hard to continue being male and I WANT so badly to transition however I love her and I believe that she loves me too.. I see a future with her, but parts of that future are murky. Like I see her clearly but when I imagine myself next to her it is blurry. Like partially 'boy' me that I have seen most of my life in mirrors has been blurred and the real me is showing through but still blurry.

I just need to hear what some of you think I guess.. I need some other insight in to how to deal with this."
nocew,asktransgender,First Therapy Session Left Me More Depressed?,"Hey. You might remember a post I made a little while back about how I was nervous about my first therapist visit. Well, it happened today and I got a lot out of my system. I was a crying mess most of the time but my therapist was understanding and kind. We talked a lot about my family though and my parents especially are against me transitioning, and always had problems with me being feminine. So... my therapist said that transitioning is a big change and I need to be ready for the worst, which in my case would be being disowned by my parents and sorta separated from them.. And she said how I need to learn to live on my own if that were the case. I had thought about this stuff before but just hearing it made me tear up. I don't want to upset anyone, especially my parents since they've provided me with shelter and education.. But I guess sometimes sacrifices must be made. I either stay as a male and feel miserable and try to just please others around me, or I lose almost everything I have and transition and finally be comfortable with myself. It's a lot to take in and I really want to transition, but I'm not sure why I'm so depressed about it. I feel it's because I'm not financially stable now and I'm not sure if I can support myself at the moment, especially with the high cost of transitioning. And I told my therapist this and she said it's an issue but I told her I'll try finding a job to try and support myself even a little bit. Part of me feels that's why she didn't refer me to someone who could prescribe me hormones.. Or maybe it always takes more than one therapy visit? I just feel it would've gone better if I lied for some reason.. Maybe I'm just feeling overwhelmed right now? Or I'm having a hard time processing all my feelings? I don't know, it's weird. Has anyone else felt this way?"

Hormones are the best thing that ever happened to me and I can attest to that.

I was browsing the front page of reddit like I always do, when I saw this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/55dt6k/pope_calls_gender_theory_a_global_war_against_the/?st=ITRSH0Z1&amp;sh=d9d930fc 

I was like ok what's this -- so I clicked it. The comments are overflowing with people discussing homosexuality and transgender issues. Some seem to genuinely be trying to look at and consider everything scientifically and fairly, other people just... no. 

I normally steer clear of these kinds of things. I just had no idea what I was getting into this time. I have horrible anxiety issues, so seeing people who are supposedly ""allies"" (there was someone who had an unstable personality disorder and claimed that trans people are also mentally ill/often emotionally unstable and can't help it) talking like we're really sick people to be pitied just made me really upset. I know I should just ignore it, but it rarely ever works out that way for me. 

People were arguing over gender roles and whether there's biological reasons ""women like the color red"", if lack of traditional gender roles are destroying the foundations of civilization, how it's affecting children, folks claiming that HRT and sex reassignment surgery are on par with cutting someone's arm off who suffers from that rare body dysmorphia disorder... There were even people talking about how this whole ""gender movement"" is harmful and just a trend, that a biological man will always be a man, etc., just... a lot of distressing topics. A lot of ""but what if""s and all those little questions and remarks people like to use to make us sound like we're just radical and over-imaginative or some variation of mentally fucked.

I'm just really bothered. I already overthink everything and my mind freaks out when I don't have a clear line of thought. It hurts to hear people say we know nothing about gender or science or biology and that there's something wrong with us, that the people who agree with us are uninformed and biased. 

How do you deal with these kinds of validation issues? Any information would be greatly appreciated. I know we still have a lot of unanswered questions, honestly I don't even remember everything I read that bothered me. It was just a blur of anxiety lmao. "

areallyterribleidea,asktransgender,How much longer can Susan's stubbornness continue?,"Here's the latest...a few choice quotes:

*""It is now the 20th day of October, by October 31st we must have a minimum of $2,000.00 raised for the month, or we cannot pay the bills for the next month and this site will get shut down.""*

Straight into the threats in the first sentence.  Shut down?  This ""crying wolf"" has gone on for years.  Either shut up or shut it down!

*""I will be totally destitute. The site's financial situation triggered my first depressive episode in the last year.""*

So your mental health and financial status is our fault?  Fuck you.

*""There is simply no way to continue to operate this website without member support.""*

Yes there is.  Stop hosting it on your own equipment.  An instant saving of $500 per month and making the site admin far easier.  And you could look for a job.  You know, like we do?

*""Of that approximately $600 goes to pay direct server expenses.""*

And **this is $500 too much!!!!!!**  It's primarily a message board, not a bustling e-commerce enterprise!!!

A message to all readers of Susan's Place:  **STOP ENABLING THIS!**  Susan is delusional.  There's something very wrong if she's stubbornly refusing to cut her costs by $500 per month immediately by using off-site hosting, all while putting out a huge guilt trip about how tight we all are for not giving her money to waste.

Something doesn't add up.  This kind of thing should throw up red flags.  She could make her budget, save the community, and save her sanity by using off-site hosting, but she's begging for extra cash so she can continue to pretend that running the site is something coming close to a ""job"".

Tough love, people.  Tough love.  STOP DONATING!  At best, you're enabling someone's rather bizarre thinking.  At worst, you're possibly being outright scammed.

I don't mind her asking for money.  But I do mind when it goes into threats, blaming, assigning fault, and a failure to take common-sense business decisions.

You really want your next monthly $10 donation being wasted on unnecessary server costs?  Because that's not helping the community.  It's helping Susan.

If you want to donate to help the trans community, your local free clinic would put that monthly $10 to much better use."
zauraz,asktransgender,What is dysphoria?,"Recently I wore my only piece of female clothing. A dark blue bikini which feels amazing. However, every time I do wear it and see myself I am remembered off how horrible, mismatched and disgusting my body is wearing any female clothing, not just the bikini.

I realize all the time that my body is a male one. It will never look good in female clothing and might never do at all. Its bulky, with broad shoulders and no curves. Generally I am apathetic about it.

Dysphoria is something I wish that I so that I could ""know that I am trans"". I have never really been able to accept that I have dysphoria. Most of the generic things can be blamed on weight, bad selfimage, self esteem, depression etc.

All of this is too confusing. A therapist had told me I was ""developing my identity"" at my age (18) and that I should ignore this. But since the age of 11 I have wanted to be a girl. To have a body that could be ""perfect"" or ""attractive"" in my own eyes. A beautiful body compared to the body I have. One with curves etc and that could wear female clothing and fit into them.

Wearing this bikini now causes me to become sad. Seeing women that looks like I would want to look like leaves me with what feels like a deep melancholy with no end. I am not sure if this is dysphoria however.

Lately I have also started to get conflicted whilst wearing female clothing. In my mind I ""should not do it"" as ""I am a male"". It looks horrible on me which boosts the previous argument. Wearing a bra causes me to miss breasts. Which leads me into myself arguing if I really want it as I do not know how it feels. Then I still want it for appearance. Appearance also causes me dount as ""how do I know I want to look like that?"". However the deep sadness from realizing I can't cosplay female characters and look like them should tell me something. Whenever I act masculine, it caused me doubts. Everyday life interacting with people causes me doubt. And there is nothing I can do to prove if I am trans leading me into a spiral of self doubt that ""maybe I am not really trans?"" A thought that is strong enough to hold me back (Yes I have read the Null Hypothecis.

Everything added up makes me feel like a monster, an abomination and the pure thing I want to be is not reachable.

This adds up extra whenever I get sexual release making me more self concious and filling me with disgust for myself.

Writing here as I really don't know what to do. My mind is in an unsolvable conflict with itself and transitioning and HRT is at the forefront with relatives and rights and wrongs.

anonymousTgirl,asktransgender,Question about what it means to present as male or female.,"If I fully wear men's clothes, go by a male name and don't wear makeup does that in itself automatically mean I am presenting male? Does it mean I am partially presenting male? 

What if me going by a male name is something I am legally coerced into? What if the fear of being seen as a drag queen makes me feel dysphoric and is one of the reasons I purely wear men's clothing?

What if I'm also on HRT, and not even actively trying to hide my breasts or hips even if I am wearing men's clothes that don't fit me well? What if I am also trying to train my voice to be more feminine? What if on top of all that I have a hairstyle almost never seen on men, am I still presenting as male?



What if I go out of my way to shave closely and hope nobody sees a beard, and hope my voice doesn't sound deep?

If when forced to choose I select the men's restroom does that mean I am presenting male?

Lastly what if I just go by whatever pronouns I'm given cause I hate fighting and arguing? Am I still presenting as male when someone asks my gender and I get scared and kinda freeze up, rather than simply claiming to be male?

Do I sound like I am presenting male to you? Or does it sound like this entire time I actually wasn't presenting male, and I that I just mistakenly thought full men's attire and accepting whatever pronouns are imposed on me meant I was presenting male?

I've read so much about gender presentation and after all this time, I'm now so curious about what presenting female or presenting male even means.

I thought I was male presenting for the longest time, but now I am not sure at all anymore. Now I wonder if I mistook presenting as a masculine woman with presenting male. Or I mistook perhaps presenting androgynous for presenting male.

I am also now wondering if passively accepting being vocally degendered out of fear or just hating conflict meant I was partially presenting as male, or if I was presenting as something other than male but just being ultra passive about it.

I have read a lot about presenting as female or male, but I admit I still don't fully understand what gender presentation even is.

Further more my dysphoria is pretty much purely physical, so fixing my dysphoria has nothing to do with what clothes I wear and EVERYTHING  to do with changing what's inside those clothes.

And well after so long of saying I present male, I now wondering I was wrong cause not knowing what gender presentation is... Anyways thoughts on this subject please? I'm just so confused about what gender presentation is, and how to define myself.

Do you think that sometimes presentation isn't always about clothing even though it sometimes is?

Is myself going to great lengths to take HRT and not even trying to hide the feminizing effects a form of gender presentation in itself?

Or do I just sound like a male presenting trans woman? Very confused how to describe myself now... Hence I'd like to know a bit more about what all counts as gender expression.

Do you think people often over generalize gender presentation?"

ZoeBL,asktransgender,It's been a while since I question myself....," Hej guys and gals
It's the first time that I am posting in reddit so I don't know where to begin. I am a straight man who for the past 15 years is experiencing some kind of discomfort. Let me explain how it all PROBABLY started. My friends and I when we were 11-12 years old and just beginning to understand how the internet works, one day we had the computer for ourselves without the surveillance of an adult. So what is the first thing that 12 year old boys will look out on the web when they are not supervised? Porn of course. That was my first visual experience with adult content/sex/porn/whatever(I had no idea how sex is until that moment). Now for the weird stuff. 

 Since that time I am envious of women. I envy the way the move, how they express and most of all how amazing and ethereal they look. I also have occasionally the feeling that I would be much more comfortable with a vagina instead of a penis. When I look at a hot girl my first thought is that ""I want to be her and wear her clothes"" instead off ""I want to be with her"". And last but not least I fantasize of being a girl all the damn time. 
 Ah... I cannot count how many times I wished to find a genie lamp and change into a girl.(or a 9th level greater wish spell)
 Now fast forward 15 years my feelings have not changed one bit or maybe I should say that they are even more intense. OK apart from cross-dressing around 5 times when I was in highschool and later on university, I haven't done anything that should considering me a candidate to be a transgender. The only thing that has ""changed"" is that I have more experience with women, even though I seem unable to finish unless I fantasize myself as the girl so I choose to be fed from their satisfaction by giving them oral mainly. 

 The funny thing is that unlike most of you here, even though I am masculine and chubby, when I see myself in the mirror I don't despise my body. I just see...me!!! OK I would prefer to see the idol of a woman in the mirror but still I don't think that my body is repulsive.

 Now I wanted to ask your opinion since I am a little bit confused. Do you thing that I have a cross-dressing fetish or those are signs that I am transgender? I know that I am probably not a cis, but I would appreciate your straight and honest opinion. 

 Also how do you cope with all this? I cannot visit a gender therapist for the next six months since the closest one is miles away from where I live. So is there anything I can do to help myself feel better?

P.S. Before you ask, YES I would press the damn button.
P.S.2. Sorry for the grammar mistakes. As you've probably guessed, english is not my mother tongue thus the poor vocabulary."
anoava,asktransgender,Lupron (hormone blocker) was denied by insurance. What can I do now?,"Long story short (if you want the long story check my post history), lupron was denied by my insurance for ""not being approved under their policy"". Others with the same insurance were able to get approved (apparently). I called the insurance to check and they said sometimes it gets approved and other times it doesn't.  
  
If you don't know, Lupron is a hormone blocker that is very effective but also costs about $1000-$1200 ever shot, or once a month.  
  
As is, I can't afford that, nor can I afford extensive hair removal through laser or electrolysis. I really want a blocker to do this so that I can stop any remaining puberty and hormonal acne. That being said, I can pass as long as I shave *twice* a day.

Is that plausible?,"I've seen a claim that Spiro has massive potential negative side effects for mental health, as well as the claim that it stunts breast growth. They argued that not only was E + Progesterone (injectable if at all possible) sufficient to suppress androgens, that it was superior. They made a similar claim about Propecia, saying that it, too, has major health side effects, and that Progesterone does the same job, better. They provided some studies to support these claims, but I don't have the expertise to evaluate them. 

Study showing negative health effects of Spiro: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jc.2008-2054

This is the study allegedly linking spiro with stunted breast growth. Basically, people who used spiro were a little more likely to get breast implants.

""The use of spironolactone as an antiandrogen seemed also to be associated with an increased incidence of breast augmentation in transwomen. The other, more specific antiandrogens and GnRH analogs were not. Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that acts as an androgen receptor partial antagonist as well as an estrogen receptor agonist. As such, in addition to blocking the androgen receptor (which is its primary purpose in this situation), it also has a significant estrogenic action at the doses used in transwomen. One can postulate that this could lead to an excessive estrogenic action and consequent poorer breast outcome by the same mechanism as that seen when patients self-medicate with estrogens. It is interesting that the other antiandrogens, cyproterone acetate and finasteride, do not appear to be used more frequently in those requiring breast augmentation compared with controls, suggesting that this is not a class effect of antiandrogens.""



How much plausibility is there to the claim that spironolactone is too risky and is counterproductive, while a regimen of estrogen plus progesterone performs better with fewer side effects? It's interesting, but I'd not particularly inclined to disregard medical advice in favor of something on the internet.

Gialicious,asktransgender,What lengths have you gone to feel beautiful or handsome? How much would you pay?,"TL;DR: Have you ever paid for a procedure or service that seemed extravagant but made you feel amazing after? 

Kind of an odd post, directed to those trans women and men who have taken certain steps to alter our appearance whether with cosmetic surgeries or superficial enhancements such as expensive extensions or beauty services. 

My birthday is in one week (next Saturday) and it is my first birthday as my authentic self. Although my hair is growing at a steady pace I have decided I really want longer, free flowing hair. I don't want to go back to wigs or clip in extensions (I have tried it all); I have researched and found tape in extensions to be the best choice for me, since I am a personal trainer who needs to be able to workout in the hair and of course shower in the hair without a hassle. Unfortunately the cost to have them installed is a couple hundred beyond what I was expecting (high class salon), and with little time to order them and have them installed, its either pay for this luxury purchase or rock my normal hair at my birthday. I guess I'm looking for some validation that I'm not crazy for willing to spend a large amount of money for something that will make me feel gorgeous on my birthday (and they last for up to 2 months without needing to be adjusted). They are a bit out of my budget, otherwise I wouldn't be stressing about it, but if I decide to get them I can afford it. "

anaspd,asktransgender,A cry for help i guess,"I have this issue where I havent exactly come out to my family as transgender only my mom and dad know for sure but i have been living as a female full time for awhile now and halloween will actually be a year but none of my family which includes my mother, father, grandmother, my sister, and her fiance is really excepting me or making any progress in using my preferred pronouns as a matter of fact its been year and they haven't even tried once not even my parents and I know i really shouldnt be angry with them because i haven't formally come out to everyone but I kinda just figured once they saw me on the girls side during my highschool graduation that they would just get it... when i told my parents they immediately wanted to help me find a gender therapist only my parents were hoping for me to get ""fixed"" while i was hoping for a referral to see an endocrinologist. the first therapist was a christian therapist and in the first 2 weeks told me everything ive felt for the last 17 years of my life wasnt real. i stopped going to him after that. so the next one which is one i found and she was very encouraging, kind, and was helping me improving my self-esteem but my mom didn't like the fact that she was encouraging me and made me stop seeing her. i haven't even brought up a gender therapist to my parents since and because i gave up hope, and am very impatient after i chilled for a few months, did my research, and thought seriously about my future i decided to start self medicating. ive been self medicating for 4 months now and could only be any happier if my family could start cooperating and transitioning with me i guess. but they act like nothings happening and my dad likes to poke fun at me with transphobic jokes and occasionally calls me beautiful but i think he only does it to provoke me in some kind of way the same way he does when he looks me dead in my face and calls me his son with a smirk on his face or when he calls me handsom but i just say shut up. im severely shy and most people find me intimidating because apparently im ""too pretty"" whatever that is and also never smile so i dont have any friends... like at all so i dont really hear anything positive or encouraging ever. my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me because in the future she says i wouldn't be able to give her what she wants and she was really the only person i had to talk to but she was right. because im actually very passable (when i wear makeup) as far as looks and mannerisms go (my voice is iffy) and people who don't know me always use she/her when referring to me is great unless im with someone in my family and people hear them use he/him then its just scary, depressing, and embarrassing. i feel like im dying in front of everyone but no one sees. i think about killing myself everyday but am to scared of fucking up and giving myself brain damage to do anything. its hard for me to ever really fully accept this and move on with the way things are right now. me and my mom never really got along to begin with so we argue even more now and i dont drive so its not like i can get away although i really want to just runaway and not look back. i never correct my family with pronouns just because i know it'll only make things worse and whenever i bring it up its an instant argument saying that im not giving them time to adjust and expect them to get it right over night... its been a year, i think we're past over night. Transitioning itself is hard enough and i feel like im alone so it just feels even worse. i think its even making me crazy cause some nights i like to imagine boy me holding me now and telling me that it wont always be this way. my grandmother always calls me a good looking man and when im out shopping with her makes me look in the mens section and when i dress more femme she always calls my parents and ask them why they let me do whatever i want and walk out the house like a ""bitch""... my big sister is actually impossible to read because ever since ive been living as a female we've gotten a lot closer and i like it but she still calls me her brother, her fiance treats me exactly the same which is fine i guess but doesnt like me around my nephew anymore. i always find myself lowering my voice when im around them not back to my old voice but just lower, idk why but maybe to avoid them saying something hurtful or starting an argument. im hurting inside and really dont know how ive even made it this far. I turn 18 in November and i feel like thats gonna open up some doors for me because i plan to speak to an endo asap. i think about where i'll be at in 10 years and its far away from my family, i have a photography job, maybe a girlfriend, and i'll be post op by then hopefully. but im struggling with just making it through everything thats happening now. I just don't know what to do anymore. I know for a fact that formally coming out to all of my family would just end in one big argument no matter how i do it so it seems useless. its scary thinking that i might really have to go through this whole journey alone. i cant even watch other transgender girls on youtube just cause i cant relate to most of them and their situations. im lost. im scared. im alone and am on the verge of giving up all hope.

Elena1270,asktransgender,Wanting to come out but I am a chicken.,"So these past two weeks have certainly been interesting. I have now been wearing a bra every day, especially when I go out. I first came out to my endo. He may be prescribing my HRT. I have seen the results of my blood work but I don't think he has. I want to switch over to injections to  ease the burden on my kidneys and liver. That because I was having pain in my upper right abdomen and feared it could be my liver. Because I was having this pain, I came out to my mothers home health aide and she has been cool about it. I went to the ER and told the ER doctor and the hospital pharmacist what I was taking. I wasn't hassled for it. The only thing I should have done was list the chemical name for the estrogen, not the brand name as this brand is not available here in the US. The result was I got my HRT minus the estrogen. Thankfully I was only in the hospital two nights and I was about one day without estrogen. Now the thing is, I REALLY want to come out. I guess coming out to these people has made me want to come out to everyone. Problem is, I am a big coward. I get just to the point of blurting it out, then my fear of not being accepted makes me back off. I hope one day I can get the courage to come out so I can transition socially as well as physically.

hmmmthisisntgood,asktransgender,"One year after SRS, still no clitoral sensation? Fffffffuuuuuuuuddddggge... (Too early?)","A throwaway because I don't want to slam my surgeon.  This is obviously a freak result from SRS, and I don't want to scare anyone off or have my posts used as ammunition by those who want to pretend she was a butcher.

One year on from surgery.  My clit is totally numb.  I suspected something was wrong a couple of months after surgery when there was no clitoral sensation, but figured that these things take time.

Well it's been a year and absolutely nothing.  Not even a hint of sensation.  I knew this was a risk.  I'm still ""happy"" with having a vagina, and don't think that the lack of sensation is a mega problem - not that into sex.  But I'd like to be able to come once in a while, and I can't.  Tried vibrators, porn, participation of others, lots of trying on my own, and no success.  Because I can't feel anything.

Any ideas?  My surgeon has basically run out of suggestions, and at this point it looks like I'm one of the unlucky ones.

So I guess my questions is whether there's any hope that I'm just a slow healer and this will remedy itself given enough time.  It's very disheartening to read all these post-SRS tales of being able to come within a few months, knowing that after all I've gone through surgically, I'm left with a bit of a lemon.

Ideas?  Encouraging experiences?  Help?"
Adrian52298,asktransgender,I f*****g hate my mom.,"**TL;DR** - My mom went with her usual lecture, pointing out my flaws and telling me to get my life going. She's worried over nothing about my classes at school. She doesn't like the fact that I'm having transgender thoughts and believes I'm using it as an excuse to be a ""pig""


She gave me a big ol' lecture because I was failing one of my classes, which isn't too much of a big deal considering I need 15 more credits to graduate and I only have 4 classes out of 6 periods. 

I don't have a 1st or a 6th periods and I come into school late and leave early. (Each class is worth 5 credits) And I'm passing 3 out 4 and every one is an elective.

Whenever she lectures she always finds a way to talk about the negative in my life since she started up a heated lecture anyway.

She starts telling me that I'm a ""lazy dirty pig"" and I have to stop with this ""gay thing"" and told me to stop using it as an ""excuse"" to be a ""bum""

She then tells me to ""Get over it now! You're a boy, and that's the way it's gonna be for the REST of YOUR life!""

My moms fucking weird, she accepts me for being gay but not transgender? Like I'm seriously mind fucked at her logic.

Let me start off by admitting that I am lazy. Everyone in the whole house is, including her! Then she starts telling me that the reason why she ""kicks back"" is because she's tired from working all day at work. -_-

She is just about as lazy as I am. She lays down all day watching TV or using her iPhone, tells me or anyone to wash and dry her clothes, pass her the remote, serve her something to drink, etc.

I once called her out on it before and she said ""I go to work and pay the bills, I shouldn't have to do anything thing around the house, you should!"" Wow... great excuse.

My grandma and stepdad work and pay the bills too and they some things done around the house!

Like I said, I am lazy. But I don't use it as an excuse to my gender issues. To be honest I would feel more **motivated** to clean up my room more often than usual if I had girls clothes. Boys clothes are so boring and whatever.

""Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going"" - Jim Rohn 

So yeah, maybe I would have the habit in cleaning up if had something to motivate me. I wish I was more active but laziness always gets the best of me. :/

I honestly want to do something in my life. It's time I start being myself and stop repressing. I'm already 18 and my whole teens and childhood were times where I couldn't be myself too often."

panickedrunning,asktransgender,How can I better support my FTM boyfriend with his dysphoria and apologize for something kinda stupid that I said?,"Okay. So, I feel bad right now. My boyfriend's family is very.... not okay with him being trans and his new coworkers are calling him by his dead name. I'm about to explain a lot and this is probably going to be extremely long, I will include a bolded TLDR, don't worry. 

Alright. Let's get started. Basically my boyfriend came out fully as trans late 2015/early 2016. His mom is... kinda accepting of it? But also kinda not? Like, she'll have days where she'll call him by his middle name (it's James- that's a name change, but you get my point) and she'll buy him clothes from the males section, right? But other times, she'll say he's a girl, or say that he doesn't have a ""guy name"" and stuff like that. I personally think she's trying her best, but it's hard for her because she's never been in the situation, obviously. 

His older sister does NOT talk to him about it. Will not. But she doesn't rag on him for it or say that he'll never be a man because of that.

Now, his younger sister... I personally believe she's a narcissist, or a great manipulator/abuser, but she's diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism, so maybe that has a play in it, idk. But she's the worst with it... yesterday, my boyfriend and his sister got in a blowout fight (which happens at least 2-3 times a month, depending). Basically, she told him that he gets offended by everything (he really doesn't, she's actually the one who gets offended by LITERALLY everything. You say ""oh my god"" and she'll respond with ""don't take gods name in vain, that's *sinning*!"" And in the same breath say omg. So.. yeah), that he's a sinner, that he will never be a man, that he's a girl, that she ""doesn't have a problem with trans people, I only have a problem with **you** being trans."" She also told him that he's a sinner and then she left, went to her room and then he went to his. And as he passed her room, she was actually praying for him to ""realize that he's a girl."" BUT when she wants something, she'll go up to him and say shit like, ""biiigg brooother *bats eyes*"" and no, he doesn't fall for it. He actually hates her. 

Anyway, that fight with her gave my boyfriend major feelings of dysphoria. Not only that but today, his coworkers started calling him by his dead name, despite his being registered as ""Josh."" This all started because a kid from his school told everyone his dead name, the kicker is that they all claim to be really liberal and accepting of everyone. Yeah. What a bunch of shit heads. 

So, after he got home, he called me. He was feeling really depressed and dysphoric and I tried help and this is also where I fucked up a little. :( We were talking about his younger sister and how she doesn't know her own religion (I'm not apart of it anymore, but I was deeply immersed into Christianity as a child and studied the bible), and I went on to say that God sees ALL sin at the same level of... evil, I guess you could say. And that she was sinning just as much as he is according to the religion, though I don't believe God is like that personally, a lot of people do. Then I said, ""take murder and lying for example, they're the same in God's eyes"" and then he said, ""yeah, compare being trans to murder, thanks"" I immediately apologized but I still feel bad :( 

I don't know what to do to make him feel better. Please, anyone give me some advice on this because I really just want to make him happy and I really want to help. Thank you for reading this monster of a post, too, if you did. 

**TL:DR**: My boyfriend's family doesn't really accept him being trans, his younger sister made him feel EXTREMELY dysphoric, and I don't know how to make him feel better during these times, please help?**

I cant really talk about it with anyone irl though because I come from a super religious family that would disown me if they found out im gay I can only imagine what would happen if im trans.

It doesn't change my capabilities, nor attitude. 

However, as I said changes are becoming apparent... and I imagine a few are curious, especially the gay guy as he's been talking to me more and more about the gay community. (I think he thinks I'm gay). Plus we were taking about wether this guy was cute or not. Like I work in a Hospital so thankfully there won't be much discrimination, but I've just never felt the need to share.

Anyways, what do you think? Do you think I should go ahead and come out, or just ignore it with work. It's not effecting who I am, and I have to wear a uniform, so it's not like I want to wear a certain gendered clothing... it's all the same haha."
[deleted],asktransgender,Complicated Relationships,"So my wife has known Im trans for over 2 years now. The problem is I decided its time for me to transition and told her so 5 weeks ago.

Decided to dress kind of androgynous at first and then go fully dressed up at home. She was fine at first but is now trying everything to talk me out of transitioning. Of course I've made up my mind and will not change it for anyone but she doesn't understand. 

To add to this she is on disability for psychosis and mood disorder. She also decided to start reading the bible again which last time lead to some harsh judgements of me. Im a complete atheist through and through. 

What I want to ask for is advice. Is my marriage salvageable at this point or is divorce inevitable? Ive held off for this long on transitioning for her but I just can't do it anymore. It's not worth it for me to be miserable my entire life to make someone content with theirs. So what is everyone's thoughts?

Thanks for being honest everyone. I should be starting hormones by the end of the year. Although all pf you are right and I know it, I'm just going to see if anything changes by then. Due to her state O would rather her leave me on her terms than me leave her. It would be better on her mind where as I feel like I can handle it and am prepared for anything. If by the end of tue year when I start hormones she is still being negative then I will probably leave her myself."

I talked for hours with one of the staff member about her life and what they do now to work on trans issues in our town and country, and one of their actions is to go to schools to raise awareness about lgbt topics. And suddenly I felt like I needed to do something. When I was 15, if someone came to my school to speak to me about this, maybe I wouldn't have waited my 23th birthday to realize that I was trans, and that it was ok to feel that way.

So right away I said to her ""sign me up, I want to be part of it"". In a few week I will become staff member, and if someday, someone come to me to say ""thank you, you helped me accept myself"", I will be able to say that my life was significant. Education is key to bring acceptance into our society."

I've been full-time for a little over 6 years (and started transitioning 8 years ago) and I still feel like this whenever I see a story about a trans girl who was in her teens (or even younger) and was able to live as herself earlier than me. It's like I feel like a failure and like I've wasted so much time, even though I know I'm lucky to have had the time I've had so far as myself. I saw a story today about a girl who was about half my age and was starting to transition in a fairly grim industrial town (I'm from an economically-depressed industrial town myself) and I just felt so much envy. I should be happy for her - and I am! - but there's just this unquenchable green-eyed monster that pops up.

But on the way home it hit me, I've not told him anything about me wanting to identify as a girl or trans issues in general. Then I got kind of scared. Sure I am out to my moms side of the family.

missgendered72,asktransgender,Who else gets gaslighted at work being called Sir?,"Hi,

In case you don't know, the definition of gaslighting is here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting

One day, someone noticed that I didn't have any hair on my leg, where men should have hair (if they don't shave it..).  Since then, everybody has called me either, ""Sir"", ""young man"" or if I do something really small that's good they say, ""good Man""..

This is beyond a joke.  Everybody in the office is doing it.  I get looks, sniggers, laughs and all sorts of other abuse but nothing physical, although I did get a screw in my car tyre once but that could have been a coincidence.

The company I work for is a large company that is supposed to look after others, so I can't see that everyone would do this on purpose, but...  They know..  and they ""are"" doing this.  I am not sure what their motives are.  I have not told them I am trans.  Since then, everybody else I know has been acting the same way, but if I meet ""new"" people - they don't act in this way.  For example, the shop at the end of the road.  ""hello Sir, what can I help you with Sir?""  ""here is your change Sir""...  If I go to a different shop that I don't normally go to - nobody calls me that and they never used to in the original shop (I have lived here for years)

Now, I know what you are thinking..  Crazy huh?  I have been sensitised to being called SIR.  Not so, as in retaliation I asked the question in general conversation, ""Do you think that bullying should be classed as murder if the subject commits suicide or attempted murder if there is a chance of it?""

Since then, the SIR's have 'almost' stopped...

What do you think of that?  I am not out yet and I don't want to be forced out either.

Could it be a mental health eval?
Could they be thinking that the best thing for me to do would be to come out and say something?  That has had the opposite affect, as now I don't feel particularly safe.

I would class my own MH as good.  The only thing ""Different"" about me is that I don't like any body hair, I prefer men to women in a sexual way, I like longer hair, want to look pretty and wear colourful clothes..  Well, I am trans and I am ok with that.  It could be that they don't believe me, as I have had very manly jobs in the past.

If anybody has any take on this it would be appreciated as it has pushed me way back into the closet due to fears of MH jumping out on me saying I am faking this due to some other disorder.  #spooked."

So, somewhat two years back I came to the conclusion of being an ftm. But, yeah, after  seeing many pictures of masculine women, like tomboys and such, I questioned if I really am ftm I always wanted to be masculine I guess. I didn't really like dresses, or hairclips and such. I never really had the urge to be a boy, but I was really fascinated with the gender spectrum. 
There are things I don't like about my body. But sometimes I'm ok with it. It's like mood-swings. Whenever someone called me ""she/her""  I would get angry. I would think, that I'm not being respected. I don't want to be compared to women honestly.
The thing is, I can see myself kinda happy in both genders. But still, I get depression even when I think of aging as a women. It is weird. I will age no matter what, I know, even as a man. Now I have the fear, that it's just my fear of aging that makes me not able to live as a female. In my current situation I don't really know how to deal with my body. I don't even know what t do with myself. I'm really tired of all this questioning. I'm not sure if testosterone will help me, or if I shouldn't take it. I don't know if I want to be a women, don't know if I should transition further. That's really upsetting.
I actually would like to talk to someone about it. I do have a therapist, but I see him only every 3 weeks.

HeyHeyHeyItsFatShay,asktransgender,How to accept yourself as trans while transitioning? MTF,"So I've been on hormones for about fifteen months, so I'm transitioning, but I still just can't accept myself as trans.

I've definitely accepted myself as female, I just haven't accepted being trans. Like I just wanna be normal, but that kinda isn't happening lol.

Idk. I hate the trans part of myself, I hate being trans and subconsciously I think I sorta hate myself for being trans. I hate having to wear two bras to balance out my figure, i hate having to have perfect posture at all times to make my shoulders look less broad.

 I hate needing ridiculous amounts of makeup to cover up my facial hair shadow (which I find beyond repulsive and totally unacceptable, but I can't afford to get it dealt with), but when I cover it I look somewhat normal (cis), so it's worth it, even though it takes me at least an hour and I lose sleep to take care of it before I go to school.

When I'm getting close with someone/plan on dating someone, telling them what I am can be so hard. I feel like I'm confessing to some kind of horrible crime, to be honest. I always tend to start with ""There's something really really bad about me that might make you hate me"" because that's the kind of reaction I expect. 

I just feel like I'll never be comfortable with being trans, and idk what to do about that. i just feel so ashamed. How can I learn to accept what I am when the vast majority of people won't?"

Day2Day,asktransgender,"Trans Anime fans, has Yuri!!! on ICE been fucking you up as much as it has me?","So I'm in a weird genderqueer/genderfluid place right now (AMAB, non-op for now), and this new anime, Yuri!!! on ICE has just been messing with me. It's adorable as fuck, and it portrays a group of characters exploring their sexuality and gender (not that it's the main plot point of the series), whether that be just in the way that they look at themselves as individuals, or how they present in their performances. Anyway, the characters make a lot of allusions to the fact that they as slender young skaters, only have a certain amount of time left before their bodies develop enough that they won't be able to be professional skaters anymore. Lately, it's been feeling like a warning to me that if I were to choose to transition, I only have a certain amount of time to do so before I'm fucked in terms of passing.

Is it just me, or is the series making others feel this way as well?"
mrlanon,asktransgender,My weekend...,"So I am just gonna say straight of the bat I am venting and am writing this quickly before going to bed as I have to arrive early at school today(00.21). I **really** need to vent though.

So my weekend went **amazing** starting of getting sick due to a lack of sleep(I seriously felt like I had the flu) after a repeated series of my unbreakable habit of sleeping late AND trying to get early to school. So I reported myself sick after trying to power through but it wasn't working. Then the next day after things were starting to look better I ended up in a Civ 5 game on Saturday. The game ended up going on a bit too long(3 'o clock something in the morning). My mom demanded I go to bed and I refused as it was a game with some friends that I haven't played for AGES. Long story short my mother plugged out the internet cable. Then I said I was gonna turn off the main power socket in the house. Then we got into a fight which got really intense(just like to say my mom is by far the worst on my trans situation). I was threatened to be kicked out and insulted(think of stuff like good-for-nothing useless child ect.).  It was then stopped by my mom's fiancee in her favor. I then started getting emotional again and went to that dark spot. I then contemplated killing myself to the point of attaching my belt to one the multi lamps in the living room(I highly doubt it would have gone to me killing myself, needed a better place, which I could have found but...).

Then I more or less hanged myself to get a ""feel"" of how it felt to end it(I was largly safe I was hanging at most a centimeter with me still standing, really it was more assisted choking if anything).

It felt for a brief moment like a lot of weight was lifted off my shoulder, but as my dad said in the past you will have that one minute of reconsideration that will feel like ages. Long story short I reconsidered. I called my dad who suggested to stay at his place for the night. I was packing but once again reconsidered. I then texted and called back and forward between my dad to say I wasn't going. I then went ahead and informed by text and emailed some government folk(youth protection, family management) who I was already in contact with for some time about what happened. I was about to go to bed when my dad called saying he called the police(because he was fed up with the situation as this isn't the first time this happened, only the last time didn't get me as close as doing anything radical as the last time, and the time before, and the time before, and the ti-). I then woke up later to a phone call of the police asking how I was. After explaining things they left it at that.

The only me and my mom spoke was about bedtime around 

And that was the end of that story.

I know I am kinda lazy and useless and sort of don't do shit without initiative, but I am human Goddamnit!

Yes I gave up finding a part-time job after failing to do after 3-4 tries. Yes I do have poor sleep and yes I spend too much time on the internet. Yes I rely heavily on the quarterly government child benefit. I also plan poorly. I do try to do my best! I do do stuff for school. Try to get on time. Don't try to fight too often with my mother. I still am waiting for my gender clinic to pull it's head out of it's arse with it's damn waiting times for things as mundane as a psychological examination.

I feel treated like shit and no-one's pulling a real arm out of me. I only get the equivalent of a ""Get Well!"" card every so often of people. 

Nothing really has changed and I feel my mom can say whatever she wants because I am a lazy good-for-nothing child and no-one can do shit to her.



I am trying goddamnit and I actually am succeeding somewhat at least school wise 

Also I have like 0 dysphoria, but only because I distract myself heavily from reality in my head, online, in books, school, ect. in roughly that order. The more immersive the better. Is there any other solution? Is there any other way out.


I feel right now as if my body consists of my brain, eyes and armst typing away at some keyboard.

For anyone curious I live in the Netherlands.

Distractions, school and life just goes on and progress is made on a cripplingly low speed. Just not crippling enough to speeding things up, but enough to hurt and exhaust.



I think that's it.

SunMoonAndSky,asktransgender,"A proposal for a new term: ""The transition escalator""","In dating land there's the ""relationship escalator"" model of a relationship, which says that a permanent relationship with kids is the marker of a successful relationship, all activities are steps toward that goal, and there are certain milestones that you reach in order: first kiss, then sex, then move in, then get married, then buy a house, then have kids...

It's usually brought up in the context of people ""getting off the relationship escalator"" because it's most noticeable by people who don't want that for their relationship for life. It's important to note that the relationship escalator does work for some people. I for one can't wait to have kids with my gf. The criticism here is that it's the default. The only ""acceptable"" kind of relationship.

I propose and call out the analog mindset for the trans world, ""the transition escalator"", in which the goal of every transition is to become cis passing. First you try on clothes, then you get hormones, then surgery...

This term isn't a criticism of that path, cuz it's perfect for some people. It's a criticism of how it's the default, most acceptable form of transition. I'm hoping that using this term will make it clearer that this is not the only path.

For those of you who want to get off the transition escalator, you do you! &lt;3"
1091114,asktransgender,Any advice for living with your parents? (Not financially independent),"Hi redditors, throwaway here. As the title suggests, any way to make living with family bearable as I try to get life in order?

For context, my family is pretty old fashioned. Dad is breadwinner and mom is designated as the sole housekeeper. Meaning-she cleans every nook and cranny of the house. She's already found out my medication for Spiro 3 times as of now in the last 3 years-I keep lying to her about what it actually is, I throw the bottle away and keep it in a plastic bag :(

So far, she hasn't told my dad because she and I are equally afraid of what will happen to each of us if he finds out. But I'm feeling really quite pathetic because I'm forgetful and all it takes is one slip up and I'll have some explaining to do about my medications. Not to mention, the fact that, as of now, I have no income whatsoever (unpaid intern) 

However, I am working on finding a job (several interviews a week, but no offers so far). I mean I guess my question to you all is, did you ever have to go through this situation and how did you resolve it? 

Having to hide yourself everyday from the people you live with (and support you). I'll be honest, living with them has given me quite a lot of privileges that quite alot of young people who come out to their families don't have-mainly a roof over their heads, food, and internet. I don't know if it's worth the cognitive dissonance-like stress, but I'll certainly have more once I become independent.

And that is ok with me. However, I don't think I'll be able to scrounge up enough money to move out in a few months, it might take half a year or longer. So now I am without my month's supply of spiro (going to have to reorder) and not get caught again, while looking for employment (not out). Anything fellow redditors of this sub can suggest that may help?"
nerdyemily89,asktransgender,Knee problems,I started HRT on Wednesday and today my knee popped out when I was sitting like [this](http://imgur.com/LVKAC0m)  which is how I normally sit in a chair. I was just wondering if this was a side effect HRT (which I don't think it is) or my body being weird? Thanks!
amon_erin,asktransgender,Internalizing all of this?,"So almost 7 weeks of HRT. Loving it so far and I'm really sure that this is the right path. I mean, I still doubt myself sometimes, but I'm at the point where I've reached out for enough help and talked to enough people and found so many commonalities that I can brush most of the doubts off.

It's a weird place to be right now. Mentally, when I haven't been out in public being gendered as male, I'm calmer. But some days the physical dysphoria isn't as bad, and some days it feels like my bottom dysphoria is gone. Like it won't be enough to qualify for SRS eventually. And, of course, all of this leads me to doubt myself.

What this post is about is internalizing and accepting yourself for who you really are. I still seem to struggle on many days with whether or not I'm actually trans, although at this point it seems pretty likely that I definitely am. My problem is that, despite everything I've felt, I still haven't internalized that I'm female. I can say it, and it doesn't feel like I'm lying. But I'll be sitting around sometimes, and the ""Huh, I feel like I did before I stopped ignoring my 'I want to be a girl' feelings."" And that sets me off doubting myself even more, and my anxiety goes up. Even now it's still kind of ""I want to be a girl.""

I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone else had this problem? And, if so, did you ever reach a point where you no longer did? That you finally ""internalized"" the ""Hey, I'm not who I thought I was and I'm definitely this."" feeling?

I know I need to work through this with my therapist, but this is really bugging me right now."

I'm really only worried about two things: have I officially landed the job and would the fact that I was openly trans at my last job show up in the background check? I went by my legal name for the first few months of work there and then my preferred/real name. For this new job I never disclosed my trans status or told them about my transitioning in the other job. I'm worried they'd discover it, think I was trying to deceive or trick them, then automatically disqualify me.


Has anyone else been through this before?

Portalboat,asktransgender,I think I might've screwed up on my injection...,"So, I just did my weekly estrogen injection, and while I was halfway through I noticed that the needle wasn't really all the way in.

I try to push it in a little bit more, but I was focusing hard on not tensing my leg up or anything. 

And now that it's done, I don't have *any* pain or blood coming from the injection site. Usually, there's at least a little. I'm not sure if the lack of it is because I didn't hit the muscle, or because I barely twitched it...

What do you guys think? Did I screw up and inject it into the fat, and I'm not going to get the full dosage now, or am I fine for the rest of the week? "
LesbihonestSeiko,asktransgender,I'm scared my partner will leave me for a trans person?,"So my (mtf) partner has expressed interest in penises, but not in men. And recently (through sneaky means that I'm not proud of), I found out that she slept with another trans woman when her and I first met (but weren't technically dating). My problem is that she won't TELL me about it. She's told me about her other sexual experiences (like sleeping with a man) but she won't tell me about this one. And from what I saw, she enjoyed that experience more than any experience shes ever enjoyed d with me. 

Will she find trans women more attractive than me? Shes been on hrt for almost a year now. "
SoConfused93,asktransgender,Am I still transgender?,"Throwaway account 

After much thinking I realized that dressing for me all started with a prom dress around 7 years old.  Since then I've always been drawn to formal dresses.  I spent most of my grade school life jealous that girls could wear them to school dances.  For awhile they were all I bought.  I would dress up when alone and imagine myself getting ready to go to the school dance.  I'm also drawn to women's clothing made of silk, and satin.  I can sit in the clothes for awhile before I get sexual thoughts.  I imagine myself going on a date/dancing with a guy/girl.  Sometimes it gets sexual but either way I ""relieve"" myself, feel bad for maybe 10 minutes max then go on with my day.  

I'm still drawn to all those things but for several years now I've been collecting more normal everyday women's clothes.  I wear them around the house and I'm very happy but then sad when I have to take them off.   According to the YouTube video on ""The Transition Channel"" I have several signs of being trans.

My gender therapist doesn't think much of it but I sometimes panic and think that all this is just a fetish.  

Does this sound like just a fetish?"

abbxrdy,asktransgender,How do you deal with being outed when getting your blood work done for HRT? Order sheet from the endo lists gender dysphoria diagnosis all over the place.,"http://imgur.com/CcaZwik

I'm needle phobic and sometimes I nearly pass out from having blood taken, so this is already an awkward process. To confound things, my blood work order sheet clearly lists the diagnosis and ICD9/10 codes for gender dysphoria on every single line item. The two places I can go to get this done run skeleton crews so it's highly likely that the person who's going to be processing my paperwork will also be taking my blood. Even worse, I live in a small town situated among corn fields and chicken farms, so the people who work there know my wife and probably know who I am as well. 

The number of people who know about my business has been increasing exponentially over the past 6 months. I had my first endo visit the other day and two people popped in to take my vitals and get my info in the computer. They asked me if I had a thyroid problem as that was the stated reason on my file. I was like, ""umm, no, no thyroid problem .... I'm here for, umm, trans stuff"". Awkward as fuck. Everybody was cool about it though. Thank god I had to drive an hour away to get that done. 

So, how do you deal with it? Is it normal to be walking in with papers that have ""gender dysphoria"" plastered all over the place? I'm not going to be in the mood to answer questions about trans stuff. 

-- Edit --
Thanks for the input, everybody. I've decided that I'm just going to roll on up in there with ""gender dysphoria"" plastered all over my papers and give zero fucks about it. If anybody wants to have a laugh or ask me stupid questions, I'll handle it with grace. The more that lab techs and other health care people see this stuff, the more normalized it will become and the easier it will get for people doing this down the line. "
alessandrawhocodes,asktransgender,Has anyone experienced anxiety WHILE passing?,"I'm starting to struggle with something a bit weird that perhaps others have dealt with before.

Yesterday, I had lunch with a girlfriend. The girl that was our server greeted us with a ""Welcome girls!"" and during the whole meal was coming back and saying things like ""Is everything right, girls?"". My friend was smiling like a fool the first time, but it did take me a bit by surprise since, in my mind, I wasn't expecting that and also wasn't completely presenting. 

As context, I was wearing a pair of pink Converse (which I love), black jeggings, but a mannish shirt and tee below. I did have my hair tied though is not *that* long. And a couple of Zelda Triforce's wooden earrings.

It was probably the best meal I've ever had and the girl got herself a great tip. But still, I was anxious about the moment when she could face ""her error"" and go back and correct herself. It didn't happen, but the feeling remained.

I've been getting this kind of reactions for some time now. Given a girls t-shirt at a conference, being greeted with ""ladies"" when I was with my girlfriend at Universal Studios, and lately, back in my country, as ""miss"" by taxi drivers, restaurant servers and such. And all of that while not actively presenting more than perhaps tying my hair and using earrings or something like that. Perhaps my usual jeans+shirt combo was making me being seen as a ""butch lesbian""?

Evidence (experienced now my girlfriend and this friend I ate, so I can now is unbiased and not something I'm imagining) would leave to believe my boy mode is failing at an alarming rate. And yet I'm struggling with, first, accepting it, but more worrying, being really anxious when it happens since I don't seem to control it and by stressing myself out that people will notice the ""error"", came back, and take away the small happiness moment I had by being correctly gendered. 

Most of the people that know me have shared with me similar experiences (a friend told be, after seeing me since May, that now I looked like a girl trying a lot to look like a guy, another's mom told her that it's impossible I'd been ever been a man and that maybe I had been messing with her all this time and I was really a girl) and all of them tell me I'm fairly passing and now is not a matter of *if* but of *when*. Of me taking the jump, and perhaps go out with an extra bit of makeup (let's say, a bit of eyeliner and lipstick), or adding a more feminine thing to my attire and that'd be it. Even my voice seems to be ok-ish (even if I haven't practised it that much, doesn't seem to dispel the correct gendering so far).

And still, I struggle to believe them. I do see myself girlish on the mirror and I do believe I have to do more work now to present as male for meetings and such, but it's like I don't find it enough. And I fear that things have gone too ""easily"". And it kinda scares me that something is coming to take it away

Whenever I share pictures with friends and they say I look great and passing, my mind fills those words with ""but it's the lightning, it's the one photo I picked, it's her screen, they just want to make be feel fine"". Obviously, this is difficult to keep in mind when things still happen in real life, and by strangers, but still some thoughts lined up (in this case, like maybe I was a bit passing and the girl didn't want to be an asshole, or perhaps it was too dark, or something). I know it sounds stupid and not too rational, but still, those thoughts remain.

Ironically, whenever I get read as male (I'd say, 50% of the time if I'm actively working for that, either by making my voice lower or something like that), I kinda get bothered but it, but feels easier. Perhaps if just what I've grown used to?

I have yet to talk to my parents but maybe this is all signing for me going to go full-time soon and it leaves me with a lot of happiness. But still, with a lot of stress and anxiety. 

Is that normal? Does it go away? I never thought I'd be facing this. I'd never dreamed that someone would correctly me gender as I am. And as scary as I feel, it's the best sensation ever. I just want for it to last."
ThrowingAway1595,asktransgender,I (male) am worried about having sex with my virgin trans girlfriend. Any tips?,"I don't know if this is an appropriate place for this question so feel free to direct me somewhere else if it is not suitable for this subreddit.

For some background I met my girlfriend in high school before she had transitioned to being a girl. We were best friends since grade 9 but she started isolating herself towards the end of grade 12 so we lost touch when I went away to university in another province. I knew she had a crush on me back then, but I didn't reciprocate as I wasn't interested in guys. Anyways back in may when I returned from my first year of school she wanted to meet up with me. I learnt that she had started taking hormones at the end of grade 12 and had transitioned while I was away. She was gorgeous and we got along just as well as before so after hanging out for about 3 weeks I asked her out and we have been dating since.

Things have been slightly awkward since she still has her penis but I have gotten used to that. I know it is a big source of discomfort for her since I tried giving her oral one time and she broke down crying. I have been worried about upsetting her so I haven't really tried anything sexual since. She has recently expressed that she would like to try having sex with me but this is something neither of us are too familiar with and is a little bit terrifying.

I have never done anal and have really only had one drunken sexual experience before. I am worried that I might hurt her, it will be messy, she won't enjoy it or might even break down crying again. I'm pretty sure she has never used toys for anal penetration before so this is completely new territory for her.

Does anyone have any tips for me or her so that this can be as enjoyable experience as is possible for us?"

VeryConfused150,asktransgender,Do cis women get turned on by their own bodies?,"I'm not trying to be controversial or offend anyone and this is a serious question. One of the main arguments against ""autogynephilia"" is that women have it to. Also when I think about it women often purposely expose themselves and flaunt their bodies in a sexual way. This includes everything from music videos to simply walking down the street. It it occurs much more often and to a different level than men. So do women get turned on by themselves and if not then what's the deal??"
GabiCap,asktransgender,Name on a Coffee Cup!!!,"Just wanted to take a moment and share this really incredible (for me) realization.

I had a couple minutes to kill before heading to therapy and since I never go to Starbucks anymore, I went to the one nearby. Though I decided to go mobile order even from the parking lot for one reason: I wanted to use my chosen name.

You see, I'm unsure about myself and thought, let's see how it feels. They called it out, I took my order and in the parking lot I saw it. Printed out was the name ""Gabrielle"" and this incredible just wave came over me.

I can't describe it, and putting my exact thoughts at that moment are hard to do. But, it seemed right. The name just fit. There was no moment of ""this is her name"" or ""this isn't mine"". I looked at that name staring back at me and all I could think was ""Me."" That name is me and it makes sense that the name is on the cup because it's my drink!

I was so happy I snapped it to a friend who doesn't know with the caption ""Sometimes you just wanna use a girl name.""

Just felt so incredible. And now I'm wondering do I feel that way about my birth name? It's a nice name and I see it and I recognize it's me and mine, but Gabrielle seemed nice... and it is good knowing the name fits me.

Just wanted to rant about it and now I'm double guessing of maybe it's just the rush I felt and it's not a sign of anything. And again, I'm just fooling myself into feeling these things and these ""signs."" But that cup makes me smile.

So strange to me and keeps me thinking."
[deleted],asktransgender,Can gender identity be influenced by trauma?,"Kind of a weird question. But let me explain.

I've got a couple of trans friends (one MtF, one FtM) and the more I've heard their stories, the more certain things started to sound familiar. I've been wondering more and more if the feelings I have are worth exploring with a gender therapist (I have no idea how expensive it is, or if my insurance covers it (I can't find anything about therapy in their coverage writeup as per 'is it or isn't it covered), and i'm on a very tight income.

I am currently 28 years old, and for longer than I can remember, I've always been very overweight. I recently started really working to lose weight, but I realized that when I look at women in the gym or around in my daily life.. what I want to find beneath all this 'mess' that i've made of myself is not some lean or muscular guy. That is the single biggest driving factor for me wondering if I might be Trans.

Another part of my brain is saying, ""No you're just crazy, you're just weird, you're just doing this to 'belong' better with your Trans friends."" etc. etc.

I've noticed some bumps that aren't far beneath my skin, and they seem to follow the path of a blood vessel that runs over the top of my thigh from my inner thigh, passing my kneecap on the left and moving a few inches down my outer calf.  

The bumps aren't painful, and my skin isn't discolored.

In terms of size, they are about a cm across, and their texture and squishiness feels like a raised blood vessel.

I notice that they stand out more when I stand up.

I'm kind of a sedentary person, except for a pretty fair amount of bike riding delivering sandwiches at work.

I've also noticed that the place the bumps are at is pretty much exactly in the area where my right leg rests on top of my left leg when I cross my legs.

I know DVT is something that people high in estrogen are at risk for, and the supplements I have been taking for about three months now (bovine ovary, along with anti-androgen herbs) are very likely to have increased my risk factor.

Should I be worried about this? Do you think it will make it harder for me to get on HRT with this kind of symptom?"

athrowawayforsex,asktransgender,Is this right or wrong? I come across this shit at random...,"&gt;Gender vs. sex


&gt;Feminists eager to remove references to sexuality from discussions of females and males not involving mating or reproduction revived an older meaning of “gender,” which had come to refer in modern times chiefly to language, as a synonym for “sex” in phrases such as “Our goal is to achieve gender equality.” Americans, always nervous about sex, eagerly embraced this usage, which is now standard. In some scholarly fields, “sex” is now used to label biologically determined aspects of maleness and femaleness (reproduction, etc.) while “gender” refers to their socially determined aspects (behavior, attitudes, etc.), but in ordinary speech this distinction is not always maintained. It is disingenuous to pretend that people who use “gender” in the new senses are making an error, just as it is disingenuous to maintain that “Ms.” means “manuscript” (that’s “MS”). Nevertheless, I must admit I was startled to discover that the tag on my new trousers describes not only their size and color, but their “gender.”

Soconfused74,asktransgender,I don't know what to do anymore,"So let me start by apologizing for any grammatical errors. I'm really upset right now.

I've had issues with my sexuality for my entire life. There has been a picture of girl in my mind ever since I can remember. I've come to terms with the fact that said girl is what I think I should look like. 

But as I got older I just convinced myself that I was gay because I thought that would make things at least a little easier (it doesn't). I've always been exclusively attracted to men, so I decided to just be...gay.

But today I went to the barber and this is going to sound so stupid but...

My hair has been falling out really bad for the last couple of months and I finally decided to ask him what was up. He proceeded to tell me that I was balding and that there was nothing I could do to stop it and that it was going to go whether I liked it or not.

Now I know this is going to sound so stupid, but the dysphoria hit me like a lightning bolt. All the feelings I've been burying for so many years have just come rushing to the surface.

I want to be a woman. If I were given the option right now I would do it in a heartbeat. I've always seen myself (in my mind) as a woman.

Women don't tend to be bald.

I live in a super conservative place and my parents would lose their minds. I've been homeschooled my entire life because of my mother fears that ""public school will brainwash me"" or something.

On top of this I have to deal with going to church every Sunday. A church that is extremely and openly transphobic and homophobic. 

And on top of that I have to deal with my mother constantly trying to make me date girls when, hard as I try, I can't be attracted to them. I want to be one.

I know it probably sounds like I'm being overdramatic and throwing myself a pity party; I know there are many people with problems bigger than mine. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I just feel beaten. I don't know how to get out of this toxic environment. I don't know if I can.

Sorry if I wasted your time I just don't know how to deal with this alone anymore.

TL;DR: I've come to terms with being a transgirl, but don't know how to deal with it. I'm sixteen years old."

So, I'm pretty overweight. Obese. But the way I gain weight is very even and this includes my face and my legs. I have a pretty nice shape if it weren't for my upper body. It's a source of my dysphoria.
I know that, when you go HRT it's always recommended to take care of any and all weight loss before HRT because testosterone makes you burn calories better because of metabolism (I might have botched that, forgive me).
But what if you wanted to preserve what you had?
I have curvy legs as a result of being big the way I am. I want to keep my legs just in case.

Couldn't I in theory block off my T, making it so that I lose all stomach fat first?

At this current time I'm pretty sure (from my weight loss history) I'd end up losing from my face and lower body first. And that would be bad because I'd just be forever bulky up top. It's not something I want and it's making me worry about whether or not I should even consider doing HRT.

tinyshain,asktransgender,When will I stop doubting my trans-ness?,"I don't think a cis woman would think so much about gender, right? I don't think I'm just a confused girl. But I also worry that I'll wake up in a year or two and regret going on testosterone. Right now, I like all the changes I've experienced so far. I like that my voice is getting deeper. I don't mind being hairier. I like feeling my muscles growing.

I think a lot of my doubt comes from society and social issues I'm experiencing. I'm still not out to anyone except a select few, so when my coworker asks about my voice or whatever, I get anxious that I have to make up an excuse. I'm worried how people are going to respond when I come out.

I look at cis women and wish I were one of them. I wish I was happy with how I was born. And I still wonder if my hatred for my body is due to just plain old body hatred, or if it's because I'm trans. I keep forgetting how uncomfortable I felt in my skin every day until I started T, and while it's still there, the discomfort is lessening every day I'm on T. But I also don't think a girl that hates her body also thinks every day about what it would be like to have a dick and how awesome that would be. I don't think cis girls want a deeper voice. I don't think cis girls would be fine with it if they suddenly sprouted a mustache. 

I mean, I guess I could achieve a more masculine body if I tried really hard to gain muscle and lose body fat. But that's not sustainable, not with the kind of life I imagine for myself. But I wonder, still - do I just want a really thin or muscular female body? I don't think so? 

I look at people and feel inferior. I'm a tiny guy, and I feel like no one will take me seriously. I know I've talked a lot about this before, but it's still something that gets to me. 

I wish I could hide away for a year until the effects of T are really apparent, and I can see whether I'm happy with the results or not. I realized I was trans and came out relatively quickly and started T relatively quickly after my realization. I don't regret moving so quickly, because my discomfort and disconnect with my body has been an ever-present issue for so, so long. And I feel like I finally figured it out, but I also worry that I'm deluding myself because I've just always been so unhappy, and that maybe this thing is what will make it better.

I also am very uncomfortable with how society treats the different genders. I hate that inequality between genders still exist. I am also, however, uncomfortable with how men are often made out to seem like they are insensitive, sex-crazed monsters. I don't want people to perceive me like that. I don't want to be perceived by women as a predator, or that I'm trying to get to know them just to have sex with them. I don't have that issue now, because I'm still largely perceived as a woman. I'm going to miss the camraderie I felt with women. I love women, but I am just so uncomforable being one myself. But the only part of myself I am uncomfortable with is my physical body; internally, I like my personality and my sensitivity and my relationships with other people. I don't want to be seen as this unemotional block of a person just because I will eventually be perceived as male.

Ugh...does anyone else that is going through or has gone through physical/medical transition still experience doubts like I do, or struggle with the issues I mentioned? Being trans is hard.

male2femaleconfusion,asktransgender,"[UPDATE] I came out to my mom and she was accepting, all that's left is my dad now. How do I explain to an openly toxic transphobic person that being transgender is a legitimate thing?","My dad hates trans people and he is open about it. Any time gay people are mentioned, any time trans people are mentioned, any time gay marriage is mentioned, any time hormones are mentioned, any time bathrooms are mentioned, my dad will be the first person to yell and scream about why transgender people are all pedophiles wearing skirts trying to anger god. There's no reasoning, anything you say goes in one ear and out the other. And if you ever do make a point that somehow sticks, he'll say ""But the bible says blah blah blah!"", even though the bible doesn't say jack-shit about trans people.

How do you get through to people like this? I'm basically asking you guys how to move a 20 ton boulder armed with only a feather and fishing rod. Even my mom agrees we should wait to tell him until after I've started transitioning and am seeing a therapist.

SoCalAway1477263273,asktransgender,San Diego health insurance options,"I'm losing the insurance I've been getting through my parents in November. I'm also not too happy with my current endo so I'm open to switching insurance networks, and my employer offers several gold level hmo plans for free. The plan I was on under my parents was a silver level blue shield ppo, and I haven't had a primary care doc since I was like 8 maybe? I've just been going to specialists directly.

The options offered by my employer are:

* Kaiser HMO
* Blue Shield HMO
* Sharp HMO
* Healthnet HMO

Does anyone have experiences with any docs in these insurance networks with regards to trans stuff? Also, if you know, how easy it'd be to get a doc on one of these networks that'd continue my current hrt script with no fuss. My current script is good until February I think.

All of my legal documentation besides state id(cause my current endo is a dumbass and won't fill out the DL 329 until you've had srs, but will sign an affidavit for birth cert and passport and social security just fine and I should stop rambling now) has been sorted already, and I'm happy with my current HRT script. I'm ~2 years into transition and consider it mostly complete except for various surgeries I'm saving up money for. If necessary I can probably contact my old psych for a new hrt referral letter as ridiculous as that may be given that all of the legal docs I'm going to present are going to have an F on them."

amaranthincx,asktransgender,Questions about transitioning (mtf),"Im 15, I'll be 16 in February.  I'm going to be transitioning soon and my parents are very accepting, and they are most likely going to let me begin HRT soon, since they switched to an insurance company that covers it and I have a gender therapist (I'm going to my 2nd appointment on Sunday).  I've partially transitioned socially (I wear makeup, eyeliner, girl skinny jeans and have a pretty feminine voice).  I also need to mention that I haven't yet officially been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

Anyways, I have a few questions.  Firstly, I was told by my mom that if you have any psychological issues a doctor won't be able to give you a diagnosis.  She told me that my mood has to be under control (it has been for the past month or so.)  I've also had a history of self harm and depression and by Monday I'll be 3 weeks clean of self harm.  So basically I'm wondering is this true that a doctor won't diagnose you if you have any other psychological issues?

Second question.  How long did it take some of you to begin HRT after being diagnosed with gender dysphoria?  And how many sessions did you go to until your therapist made a diagnosis? 

My final question has to do with fat redistribution.  I've got about an inch or less of belly fat and I'm wondering if it will be redistributed?  Or should I lose it before I begin hrt?

"
Celery_Duff,asktransgender,I guess this is happening...,"So this will be a bit of a long post, but bear with me...

So I have felt like I might be trans for about five years now. In high school I started cross dressing and camming in private without showing my face. In college I came out to a few friends, about two years ago, but didn't really do anything from there and haven't since come out to anyone else. I go through long periods of time where I'm totally content being male (or at least I think I am) where I fetishize trans women and andro's and cross dressers, etc. but almost every winter my seasonal effective disorder kicks in and I have a breakdown and start to shave my legs and eat super healthy and work out to try to be more feminine. Last winter I went as far as getting prescribed hrt, which I took for a few weeks and then gave up on because I had serious doubts and started seeing a girl that I didn't want to have this discussion with. Fast forward to this winter, I had another ""episode"" if you will, and have decided to start hrt again. I've been on them for about three weeks and am forcing myself to continue because I feel like it will make me take this further and come out to those close to me. I'm like not totally miserable as a male but I'm 22 and if I really am trans I don't want to put this shit off any longer because I still have a pretty good  shot at passing I think. My issue is that so much of the time I'm relatively comfortable as a male. Like I have these doubts that this is just some fetish that's gone too far, and I'm hypnotizing myself into being trans. Has anyone else had an experience like this? I'm so fucking unsure and I just want to be certain of something for once. My goal is to continue with hrt until I'm forced to come out if it doesn't happen sometime soon. I'm so scared of everything, of not being accepted and not being able to find a good job or a partner who accepts me for who I am. Plz just talk to me I need all the advice I can get."

Effowrecks,asktransgender,"Hey, you! Are you questioning? Are you struggling? I've been there, and I wrote this for you.","Here's my story.

Two and a half years ago, living abroad in Canada, I started figuring it all out. I'd known on some level for years, I'd done my best to run away from it. I did my best to deny and repress it, but that feeling always came back.

Eventually I decided to address it, to stop running. I sought therapy to help me with my feelings around gender identity. I saw a fantastic therapist who really helped me to investigate and wrap my head around it and begin to accept that I was in fact a woman. Nontheless this was an incredibly difficult time for me, my head was constantly filled with dread and anxiety, I felt constantly depressed, dysphoric and at the verge of tears about it. It was on my mind from the second I awoke to the time I eventually passed out each night. I wrestled with suicidal ideation for a long time. It's a mindset I can no longer really understand, but I remember how it felt. 

I eventually shared my feelings with my partner at the time. She tried her best to be supportive, but she couldn't handle it. Months later, as our relationship dwindled due to the elephant in the room, she eventually ended up leaving me as I moved further toward making the decision to transition. The breakup did however give me the resolve and freedom to begin to really undertake transition.

So there I was thousands of miles from home, heartbroken and more or less alone. It was an indescribably hard time for me as everything I'd known was turning on its head, and I needed support then more than ever. I needed connection, so I started coming out to close friends back home, a real select few, and I found nothing but love, understanding and support from them - much to my surprise.

Eventually, with the help of my friends, I gathered as much courage as I could muster and crafted a letter of over 10,000 words to my parents. I did my best to explain and preemptively answer any questions, to give them something to read and read again. I wanted to be honest with them, to give them the full story, because I was through with lying about who and what I am. Clicking send was the scariest thing I'd ever done, because it made it real.

The following day I read messages from my Mum, Dad, brother and sister in law. They were filled with love, understanding, sorrow and with relief. They'd known something was up for years and they were glad I had finally told them what was going on, because now they could help. I'd been emotionally distant for years due to the metaphorical armor I'd clad myself in, and now I was starting to let them in.

I went on with transitioning, my therapist eventually signed me off with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The green light to start taking hormones, the first step of many that would take me down a road to happiness and wholeness. Three months later I'd see a specialist who would prescribe me my initial dose of estrogen and anti-androgen medication. Taking that first little handful of pills was an amazing moment that I won't be forgetting. It was achievement, recognition and vindication rolled into one.

Time went by and I was still mostly closeted. No-one beyond my immediate family and a small group of close friends had any idea. I'd not yet gathered the confidence to make any move in presenting as myself in the real world. I'd decided I would publicly/socially transition as and when the hormones I was taking caused me to fail at passing for male. By my estimate that'd be around six to nine months after starting HRT.

One night, in March or April, only two or three months into HRT, I recieved a message from one of my close friends who was 'in the know'. He was asking me who I'd shared my story with. As it turned out, people back home were talking about me, there was a rumour going round that I was trans. I immediately felt sick to my stomach. My initial reaction was to go outside and chainsmoke. I don't know how long I was out there, ebbing and flowing between softly crying and hyperventilating as I tried to process the fact that I'd been outed and that I'd have to somehow address this. The voice of anxiety inside my head was louder than ever and it was a struggle to placate.

Some time later, after I'd calmed down and numbed somewhat to the situation, I went back inside to my laptop. I found out the full story of what was happening back home from my friends there. I pieced together what had happened. I found out who had outed me. I'd misplaced my trust in someone else who was LGBTQ, thinking they'd have discretion and respect, being 'under the rainbow' themselves. I found out to whom they had outed me - a pair of nasty people I'd long since cut out of my life for other reasons had got hold of my story and were peddling it to my friends in an effort to impress and gain influence, in a very childish 'I know something you don't know' way.

I realised there'd be no point denying the rumours only to later come out. I'd been pushed into a corner and my only viable move was to come out, to reclaim ownership of my story, and to point out what a shitty thing it was for these people to act as they had. So I took to my laptop and started writing a post to go on facebook. Eventually, after reading and revising a thousand times I clicked post. I muted my phone and turned off my laptop. Unreachable and at peace I went to sleep.

[This is what I woke up to.](http://imgur.com/a/fd2vX)

As I read through the replies the following morning, watching yet more appear one by one, as the private messages from friends far and wide popped up on my screen, and with every 'like' on my post, I swelled with this peculiar feeling. It was something I didn't rightly understand or really recognise at first. The alien sensation was pride. 

For the first time that I could remember, at the age of 23, I felt proud of who I am.

The weight was lifted, the pressure and discomfort of living in the closet was over. I could be me, and the people in my life had my back. It seems silly to me now that I ever doubted that'd be the case, but I know too well how easy it is to listen to internalised transphobia. I know intimately how depression and dysphoria can taint your view and expectations, leading you to assume people will react negatively, to lack self-worth and self-love and to feel isolated when you've got a secret. But being trans doesn't have to be a lonely experience. It took me a long time to figure that out.

That's why I'm sharing this story. I owe an awful lot to this community. Reading an account like this when I was at my lowest might have helped me, have given me hope. So I'm paying it forward. I know how hard it is, how bleak and alone it can feel to be trans, especially in the early days of figuring it all out. Looking back, my story has had its ups and downs, but here, today, I can look back and say it's been wonderful, and a far cry from what I expected it to be when I first started seriously exploring my gender identity. Today I'm back home in the UK, I've fully transitioned and the world knows me as Kim. I'm happy and comfortable, more so than I've ever been.

***I want to now talk directly to you, the reader - especially to those of you who are questioning their gender identity, struggling and wrestling with their dysphoria, their anxiety and mental health, with their apprehension and fear:***

I want you to know that it's not all doom and gloom. Media and statistics can be very discouraging with this kind of thing, but your story *will* be different.

Yes, things might go wrong. You're going to face challenges and struggles, those you've anticipated and those you've not. But you know what? It's worth it. And what's more, you're going to find out that you're stronger than you ever thought you could be, and in the end you're going to be okay.

Friends will surprise you, family too, with their love and understanding, with their support. It will get better. You will get better. You will make it through this.

Throughout my transition, my story, I've found that every time you've a bridge to cross or a hurdle to vault over, you're gonna get better at it. Though they might seem insurmountable at the time, just go for it, because you'll make it, and you'll look back and wonder what you were worried about. Each time you take that leap into the unknown it makes you stronger, which makes the next challenge easier to handle.

Then one day you'll find yourself where I am now, looking back at the hardship and struggles that you've faced. You'll be able to contrast it with the happiness and love you feel from others and for yourself that comes with living an authentic life, with unashamedly being who you are. Most importantly, you'll feel the same sense of pride that I'm feeling now.

I believe in you. You've got this.

tl;dr: Being yourself is awesome."

Consequently, while they may be around, I have a lot of time and space to work on voice and other aspects of being femme.

That all said, my hair is goddamn short.  Another project?  Well, not short short (It's just touching my ears), but getting it cut is pretty much a nightmare.  My hair is actually my favorite feature.  I have a fairly thick head of hair, It's a nice, appealing brunette, and I get a natural wave when it gets long.

So, I'm considering just growing it out.  My concern is am I hire-able with long hair?  I mean, this second career is as a social studies teacher, right?  I need to look presentable as a male for the next year or so.

So, I guess my question is about this: http://menshairstylesweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cool-Long-Shaggy-Hairstyle-for-Men-363x500.jpg

1.) Obviously, going with a cleaner, tucked behind the ear look would be better for an interview, but would you hire a guy with hair that long to teach your kids?

I'm so depressed, I keep having thoughts of ending my life, and I nearly had an emotional breakdown in school the other day(I had to hide the tears streaming down my face.)

And, one of the reasons I feel that way is the guilt I feel concerning my dad. He doesn't want me to jump to any conclusions or label myself, and I understand that, BUT I WANT TO BE A WOMAN! And that's all that should matter.

Even if I haven't started talking to Someone, I want to be considered his daughter as soon as possible. It feels like I'm living a lie and I hate it. I just want him to accept me for who I am. It's not that he's AGAINST me being trans, Its just his parental instincts getting in the way of taking me seriously. And he needs a professional opinion, and I get that.

I just find it harder and harder to cope every day and just ending my life so I don't have to burden anyone with this seems like a more promising option everyday.

So, to keep my sanity and make me feel better, would it be slot to ask my dad to start calling me by my real name?

marmitamise,asktransgender,Having doubts about transitioning; can any one advise (sorry for same old kinda question),"So I've pretty much accepted that I'm probably trans. My experiences don't match everything that I always see on here but a lot does match. It may not mean much but I also meet the DSM criteria for gender dysphoria which is kinda reassuring.

But of course none of that means I ought to transition and I'm really torn about this--or rather my therapist has been hinting about hrt and I'm not sure whether to take this up. I've tried writing out the pros and cons but it feels stupid because it always comes out the way I want it to---pro transitioning---and then you can go round in circles about what this means.

The real issue is that sometimes I certain I oughtnt to do this; that I'm fine as I am in my male body and that my life is pretty good and doesn't need to change. I can't tell if this is fear of the unknown or uncertainty or a genuine indicator to reconsider

I know it's possible to go on hormones for a short time without huge consequences (possible sterility etc) but im reluctant to do a big thing halfheartedly. I've also tried visualising how I'd feel if I made a definite decision---this came out as pro transition to but it didn't change my mind.

Final thought: I basically want you to advise me to transition and I guess that's evidence of an kind but really if anyone can help advise my rational self I'd be so so grateful

Throwaway591983,asktransgender,Hormones drastically changing someone's sexual orientation?,"I [18/M] am with a [18/F] transgirl who I've been in a relationship since December 2014. On March 2016, she began hormone therapy, and in April 2016 we met in person for the first time for two weeks in my home country, as we previously were in a LDR (her from Australia, myself from the US). It was pretty much everything we expected and more. 

In July 2016, I moved in with her because she's been struggling with severe depression due to going to one of the most competitive all boys schools in the country, and we both agreed that it'd be best if I moved in with her for her own safety due to her having suicidal thoughts and a desire to self harm. We originally planned my flight for when she started university, but this was alright too since I had graduated from high school in June.

However, she's experienced a drastic shift in what she's attracted to. I found out a week ago that she was having a very romantically/emotionally intimate relationship with another transgirl for about a week, bordering on sexual and would have likely got to that point if I hadn't found out. This was something we definitely considered to be cheating, but I wanted to give her a second chance.

But there's an issue. Her sexuality has changed to the point she's almost exclusively attracted to those on the very far end of the femininity scale if we were to create one of stereotypically masculine and feminine characteristics. She's been struggling to feel and show affection, whether it be emotionally/physically/mentally. The therapist she's seeing has suggested that this could just be the result of her being a young person going through a pretty impactful medical process, and that it wouldn't necessarily be permanent.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this beyond ""moving to a foreign country at 18 for that purpose probably wasn't the best idea?"" Which, granted, it's not, but we factored in pretty much all the variables except... her suddenly having a major attraction shift, I guess? She previously identified as bisexual. She mentioned to me that if she was with the transgirl in question, she'd want her to transition first, so it's not her now thinking that I'm an uggo or something because she still feels that I'm just as attractive as I always was. I'm just not overly feminine. "

alex_the_bolshevik,asktransgender,Is Far Harbor about being transgender?,#
RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,Beating feet or staying?,"This may be a bit long, but I have a fairly major decision to make in the coming weeks.  I've gone over it myself, I've gone over it with friends, and I've let the family I'm out to chew on it a bit too.

Oh, and transwoman (back) on HRT for almost three months now.

So, I'll jump right in.  I'm 34, and a few years ago -- honestly in a depression fog and with zero fucks to give -- I decided to go back to school and nab my teaching license.  I'm now a fully licensed teacher in Illinois, a state that is flat out broke and can barely make even marginal payments to districts.  So, hiring is tight.

I ended up subbing (the pay isn't bad, honestly) at the district I did student teaching, with the idea of putting everything away, work on as much of my transition as possible, and then leave for greener pastures.  I've begun quietly coming out to some of the people I worked with during my student teaching.  I was basically polling them to see how I should handle my transition.  Should I come out beforehand or after, how they think I might navigate administration and parents and community.  Big stuff someone in ""the shit"" would know, right?

The deal is, coming back I realized how much I liked these people.  They were super cool with my trans status, they got a kick out of my pickle jokes, and they've been aggressively helping me ""meet the right people"" in the district.  I'm even out to the department head.

I really want to stay now.  Other factors exist too.  I like my therapist.  I like my endo.  I like that my GP is fully on board.

The incentive is there.  But, getting in will be difficult.  I'll likely have to pick up a kinda low paying aid position ($25k, but health and dental) and wait for an opening (could be as late as 2019).  They almost exclusively hire internally.

I could also transition sooner.  If I nabbed an aid position in the spring (Well, January, but school lingo being the spring semester) and my eventual department knew I was trans I have immediate inside allies to help me navigate the process of socially transitioning on the job.

Or I could beat feet, run for a state where I have the same protections and probably more jobs.  Then, though, I have no support network, and I'd likely have to establish myself for several years before I could do anything.  I'd also have to drop a good bit of cash on the license transfer and I need to do it soon, hence the time table.

And, well, I guess the big wrinkle is there is the dysphoria to contend with in waiting and the fact that I've already got boobs. Hehe.

I'm heading to bed, but I thought I'd let the night crew (if you're American) chew on this and give me their advice."

is_Briana,asktransgender,Can anyone relate?,"Long post ahead…

Another ""is this normal/does this make me trans"" post.  Sorry… I know you can't answer it, I just want to know if anyone can relate really.


I've been questioning since I was around 10.  May have been a little earlier.  It started when I was playing with my sister.  We were playing some sort of pretend thing, and I pretended to be a mother or something.  I can't really remember exactly what we were doing, but something clicked in my brain in that moment, and I haven't been the same since.

Sometime around this period (shortly before or after this event), there was this thing on NPR that my dad was listening to about a transgender woman.  The only thing I can remember thinking about was how her voice was messed up because she had some surgery that didn't go so well.  I don't know if it played into any of this, but I still remember it happening so it has to mean something?

I started visiting online forums (started with Transfemme message boards), and found someone I could chat with on AIM who was around my age.  I was cross dressing pretty regularly in this period in whatever I could find, I also was fetishizing it somewhat.  Anyway, I talked to this person extensively about my transgender feelings, and they convinced me to tell my parents.  So I told them, and the next day I ""untold"" them, and said I was just a cross dresser.  This happened when I was 15, and I somewhat believed myself.  Of course the feelings didn't go away, and I eventually caved and told my parents again when I was 17.  

This time I tried going to a therapist, and was just short of actually doing something with regard to this when I decided it was time to ""untell"" my parents again.  I told them I was wrong and that this wasn't what I really wanted, but deep down I knew this wasn't the truth.  I had been through this before with myself, and I knew it wouldn't go away.  Anyway, for whatever reason I decided that it just wasn't worth it, so I bottled it up again.  I stopped cross dressing for a bit after this, but I couldn't quit doing that.  I needed some sort of release.  I soon realized that cross dressing wasn't enough, but I was too afraid to ""come out"" to my parents about wishing I could be female.  I kept it inside for a few years, until I was ~20.  I told them again, and found a therapist on a list on Laura's Playground.  This therapist turned out to be a pretty bad match and had me convinced I was a normal guy and that I should stop trying to be something I could never be.  Basically she said I am handsome as a guy and I wouldn't be pretty as a girl.  So yeah, that hurt and I bottled it up again.  During this time, I was experimenting with psychedelic drugs, which actually helped with my dysphoria until I went to this therapist.  After going to this lady my life got pretty dark for awhile.  I started to smoke weed heavily, and kinda just numbed myself.  I was also drinking heavily one day per week (Friday).  

Since this last time going to the therapist, I haven't talked to my parents about it again.  I am 26 now, and I am not really any further than I was when I was 10.  I mean, I know more now than I did then, I have even tried to self medicate hormones which really helped to be honest.  But for whatever reason I just feel like I am not transgender.  I feel like, after all I have been through I would have figured it out by now, and the fact that I haven't makes me feel like it just isn't true.

And honestly that would be great if this is the case, because then I could move on.  But, alas, I can't move on.  Taking hormones only confirmed to me that I want to take hormones, yet I am terrified of what they will do to me.  I am terrified of the eventuality that would cause me to be outed because of taking them.  I don't know how I could even consider socially transitioning ever, because I don't think I would ever pass.  It makes me feel like it just isn't worth it to even try, but that doesn't matter anyway because regardless I am stuck with this feeling.

I know I am not CIS, and I don't feel ""Trans"" enough to do anything about it.  I just feel stuck, and my mind has been in a clusterfuck for so long now that I don't even know what to do about it.

I went to a therapist, and they were able to help me sort through some of this, but in the end it comes down to me making a choice between moving forward with it or not, and I am absolutely terrified of moving forward with any sort of transition, whether it be physical transition or social.

Anyway, sorry for the long post about my life.  I just want to know if anyone can relate with this in anyway.  I am very alone in my life right now, and I know I can really only blame myself for that, but it would help to know that I at least have something in common with someone."
Hrttt,asktransgender,Does this thought mean I'm probably not a transgender woman because I'm doubting?,"I just thought to myself ""If I go on HRT and I regret it or don't like it, it doesn't matter"". "
oncerydia,asktransgender,Body Dysphoria is ..... Horrifying?,"(Way too long; sorry.)

So I never used to experience body dysphoria. My shit was always like, ""wishing""-based, and envy-based, if that makes sense. But none of the stuff about ""I can't stand my own body!"" Or ""my [insert primary or secondary sex characteristic here] disgusts me!"" Instead I always felt like my body was irrelevant, like I didn't even live inside it, but more like it was just a construct I could control with my mind.

So six weeks ago or so, I finally figured out that I am transgender. One of the biggest, most immediate, and initially very strongly positive consequences was that I started to feel ""embodied."" That's the best way I can describe it really. It's something that only makes sense to me in comparison with the *absence* of feeling embodied that used to define my reality for nearly 40 years.

The positive aspects were, and continue to be, that I feel ""present"" almost all the time, that sensory information feels ""more real,"" and that I can feel my own body in a much more immediate and constant way. The closest I ever got to feeling like this in my former life was when I was stoned; stativa strains would often give me the feeling of sensory""presence,"" while Indica strains would often make me very conscious of my own body (I usually found this experience to be unpleasant, but it was tempered by the euphoria from being high). Now it's like I get both of these all the time and without having to spend any money on weed or endure the unpleasant side effects that it often caused in me.

Over the ensuing weeks, I've come to realize there's negative effects as well. Namely, I seem to have become vulnerable to body dysphoria. At first it was relatively mild, but in the past week it's fucking exploded in intensity, to the point where doing things like shaving my face or even just glancing in the mirror have given me panic attacks. (Having never had those before, I can say that they're even less pleasant than I imagined they would be.) Yesterday in the shower, I also got the urge to vomit while shaving and from washing myself. This morning I got a huge dysphoria episode simply from changing my clothes.

What sucks the most about this for me is not how surprising it is, or how much I'm like feeling fear about ""what's next?"" or any of those things. The worst part for me has been the *terror* I've felt during some of these episodes. It's like something is screaming at me that this body isn't mine, and I feel so scared. When talking about it today with my wife I was basically like, imagine you woke up one day inside my body. Wouldn't that scare the shit out of you? Because that's how I feel right now.

I'm not sure what to do for the time being other than to try to use distraction and dissociation techniques like meditation and mantras and shit. I do not want to have to get fucked up drunk just to be able to shower without fear (or get drunk at all, for that matter), and I'm not sure it would even help. I have no idea what to do.

Anyone have any advice? Other than ""start HRT right away"" because I can't right now."

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,People are nicer to me?,"I'm mtf transitioning, but I'm not out. I still have facial hair and I wear baggy clothes and all that jazz. So it's not people thinking I am girl. 

But for the past month or two , I've been noticing that people are more nicer to me in general. People hold doors for me even though I'm far away, people randomly initiate conversations, people smile at me more while and wave high. I dunno it's really weird. None of that's ever happened before at this amount. 

And the other weird thing is, that there are always people staring at me. Especially in lecture. I'll randomly look over and make eye contact with someone, who is obviously staring at me, and then they quickly smile and turn away. And then I see them staring at me again later. It's so strange. 

In highs cool I was the quiet shy kid in the back who never spoke and most people didn't even realize who I was. Now people always stare at me and I feel out of my element. 

My personal theory is that since starting transtion, I am not as angry as I used to be and I probably don't look like I'll bite your head off anymore. 

I still don't know why people are staring at me though.

* I Met my new endocrinologist (Endo#1) who, upon hearing I wasn't interested in bottom-surgery, tried to strong-arm me into getting a psychological evaluation. She was also highly dismissive of any advice I had gotten from my previous doctor, which irked me a bit.
* Endo#1 scheduled me for blood tests and labwork.
* Endo#1 told my my results looked great!
* I looked over the results myself and noticed she didn't actually test my testosterone levels at all.
* I Point out the discrepancy to Endo#1, she re-orders the ENTIRE round of tests + the missing one.
* Results look fine, but Endo#1 thinks differently and lowers my dosage without discussing it with me.
* Fought with her over email and over the phone, got her to put my dosage back.
* Fed-up with the situation, I file a formal grievance and get switched to a different Endocrinologist (Endo#2).
* Endo#2 orders ANOTHER full-round of blood tests (I guess she's assuming the first TWO rounds are in-error?)
* At this point, a HUGE bill comes in the mail for the first two rounds of blood tests.
* File ANOTHER grievance to get the bill corrected, because I'm not paying for 3 full rounds of blood tests when the first two were (apparently) in-error.
* They say they'll take 30 days to figure out what to do with me, but I plan on calling once a week until it's sorted-out.

NewPerspective5,asktransgender,[MtF] How to find content as a woman pre-HRT?,"tl;dr: Does anyone have any tips on how to look more natural(or cis I guess) pre-HRT?

The process has been long and I am finally feeling like I am beginning to understand myself and where my biggest challenge is, finding content or satisfaction with my look.

I know now that being a woman is the only way to experience sensuality and that the sexual drift is quite strong in me but requires a female body. However when it comes to gender expression I have always presented male and never believed in me being able to present as a female (even though I have wanted to at times).

I have tried to experiment with women’s fashion and style(alone home) but I am always disappointed. I feel like a freak or not looking decent enough to let anyone else see me. I come to realize that too feel comfortable I need to look good/natural enough in a female expression that still feels like myself. 

To present full-time female is a requirement to start HRT where I live, so starting HRT before going full-time is not an option.

So does anyone have any tips on how to look more natural(or cis I guess) pre-HRT?

I have been thinking about going to a neighbouring town to get a full make-over via personal shoppers, make-up stores and hair saloon. But I am scared that they are inexperienced in concealing the male characteristics and that I will only be wasting my money. Have anyone tried this, and what was your experience?"

zauraz,asktransgender,"Loneliness, apathy and certainty..?","I am tired of being like this. For over 10 months I have been thinking about my gender 24 hours a day.

The first month was different. I was happy, it felt like a puzzle piece had fallen in place and I had a certainty or 'vision' about what I wanted. I came out to my mom and my bestfriends and started getting regular therapy.


The following months were not as easy however. My certainty/happiness turned into a constant spiral of doubt and confusion. I kept researching even if my therapist told me to stop doing so and found the Null Hypothecis. It shed light on it all and made me feel that I was able to accept being trans until talking to my mom. She seemed to get mad whenever I brought it up these first months and it crushed my hopes. For every hour of every day I thought about if I was trans or not.. I felt like I made no progress etc.. My desire became less clear during this time aswell and I started if what I had wanted was true..

My therapist managed to make me avoid thinking it for some days/weeks but it returned thereafter and worse than before. Around this time I started talking to a transwoman over internet and she rekindled the hope in me about transitioning. I brought up to my mom that I wanted to get gender investigation therapy as it is called here and did so eventually.. 

Shortly after this I also managed to find a chat group for trans people online that helped making me feel a bit more certain in this. However now my gender started affecting my relations to people.. I got more sad/tired and I started feeling like a 'liar' and 'fraud' to people I met talked to. It felt like I was putting up a face and they never saw or knew the 'true me'. Doubts returned alongside this and now I started to get less of a reaction internally out of talking with people.. My mom also started teasing me by saying thinks like ""you can't be a girl due to [stupid reason]"" and it only put more fire on my doubts and even hurt sometimes.


 Now I am waiting for my gender therapy after finishing the preliminary psychiatrist meeting. However I have lost my path.. I don't have a desire to try things or do anything as it won't bring me closer to having a body I want. In general I feel mostly apathy about it all or end up in a spiral of doubt from time to time that is equally unproductive every time..

What is most horrible for me is the fact that I know what I truly want. I see it, the evidence, the desire. But there is this internal invincible barrier that makes me deny it.. I am too scared to admit to neither myself nor anyone who cares about me... Its too big a change and will bring so much consequences etc.....

It's not normal rage it's different. Like I've  felt this before in my teens but it's come back now. Will this go away at some point?"
ThatGirlOverThere9,asktransgender,If my therapist recommends my endocrinologist me off of my hormones because of suicidal ideation can I get an informed consent hormones?,I'm afraid that might happen and if it does and I can't get back on hormones pretty much immediately I know that I will have his a psychotic breakdown and almost certainly end my life. Thus defeating the purpose of the contract I signed. My therapist said she's going to try and work out a different contract with me but she has to talk with her supervisor and she also said that she is obligated to tell my endocrinologist but she's not legally allowed to do so without my verbal and written permission. Please help I'm scared.
Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,Dating in early transition questions.,"Hello ladies and gents!  I'm about 4.5 months into hrt and I've been doing fairly well with my social transition. I'm not out at work but I am presenting everywhere else.  I've been out for two weeks now. I went ahead and got on a couple of dating sites for shits n gigs, and to see if I got any male attention. I did. There have only been like two creepers. O these sites I decided to be up front on being trans. First question: should I do this is I am interested in going on dates or should I wait? 

Should I even consider dating? Not necessarily looking for the 'one', I mean if it happens great, but I'm just casually dating. I pass within reason, some people gender me female, and I'm sure some people clock me as trans. 

Anyone else have experience?"
APhoenixRisesFromAsh,asktransgender,Coping?,Do any other trans people have specific coping mechanisms? I have tried everything but the dysphoria is at an all time high. Its taking its toll on me now. There isnt a thing now that I can do without thinking about being a girl. It sucks.

dopplershift94,asktransgender,"I identify as ""straight"", but I just started dating a FTM guy.","I have always identified as straight, but then I met this guy who I had a weird attraction to. I didn't undertstand it, but I later found out that he was transgender. 

I know that biology works in many different ways with pheromones and other things. So, I'm still accepting that fact that I'm dating another guy, but I love him. 

I don't know how to identify as straight, but then introduce people to my boyfriend. I can't tell them that he's trans because it's not my right to tell them or out him. Although, I'm not a shame of it. 

How do I resolve the difference between my sexual identity and the person I am dating?"
RedRobyn21,asktransgender,Shoulder dysphoria,"Before starting HRT my dysphoria was really bad about my height, hands, forehead, hairline and shoulders. Since starting a month and a half ago everything has lessened somewhat, except the shoulders. 
 
Does dysphoria around shoulders usually go away somewhere down the line or is it just one of those things I can't change that I'm gonna have to deal with? 
 
I'm 21 btw if that makes any difference "
[deleted],asktransgender,"Trans, homeless, unemployed, treatment-resistant depression... How do I get out of this?","I have pretty much no one in my life and I don't have much hope. I have nothing to fucking live for. I tried working but got fired for my depression. I don't even have clothes I can interview in even if I could work. Nothing fits. I'm getting tortured by dysphoria every day and HRT only does so much... And I'm nonbinary, so I both hate my body and hate that I have to restrict my expression so that I don't get misgendered. I have no way to make friends since I'm not in school or working. 

I'm in a youth LGBT emergency shelter which is a really shitty environment that's taking an even greater toll on my mental health. I already had to switch rooms because one of my old roommates was getting handsy and saying uncomfortable/suggestive things (he's bi and made a comment about my tits because I changed shirts in front of him, and kept talking about how much he wanted some pussy when we were in our room together) and my other roommate was jerking off over my unconscious body while I slept (I think he was gay though so yay for passing or something I guess).

I just don't know what to do. All signs point to ""just fucking kill yourself already""..."
Dannyboyy1993,asktransgender,Hookups apps,"Back when I was single I legit had to educate about 100 guys who didn't know or cba to google what ftm means and then asking if they could see -_- 

I actually did meet up with quite a few guys (mostly bisexual) mostly of them inexperienced with transmen and you could definitely tell. Met up with a gay guy who knew I was trans but when we got down to business he says *its* freaking him out. That was a disappointment. Also had a fair share of 'straight guys' who didn't think this may be a little bit gay. 

How did everyone else get on with these? "
BerryKnight,asktransgender,Finally something good happening!,"I've been trying to get treatment from Dr Webberly (the GenderGP doctor) and at first I was worried she ""didn't believe"" me or wasn't sure I was serious (I'm really bad at expressing my thoguhts and feelings so she was thinking that) but Sunday night I basically emailed them again and just poured my heart out about things and I got a reply today saying she thinks going ahead with the treatment is a good idea, so I  think next step is blood tests and then starting hormones so I could be on hormones before xmas I'm hoping!

I really don't know how to feel now though, on one hand I'm super hyped and so happy I can finally take steps to reconcile the divide between my ""me"" and what the world gave me, I'm hoping so much that I can finally stop just existing and start living again (I made a thread about it a couple days ago, I basically can't bring myself to care and do anything anymore, I fail at keeping a clean house, taking care of myself I even fail at enjoying myself)

But I'm also terrified that I'm pinning to much on this and it'll be like people are warning me, just a tiny change that will barely help at all....if that is true it'll break my heart because this is honestly my last hope, nothing else has helped, anti depressants do nothing at all, counselling was a bust....I'm so scared my life has hit it's limit, that I'll never accomplish anything toward my dreams

I'm so confused right now! It kinda make me glad I barely feel anything or I wouldn't know if I should bounce around happy or be terrified ^^"

But... my roommates. Oh god, I hate them. Everyone's deadnaming me. One of them went overboard with his stupid joke and i said to my landlord that if he won't do something about him, I'll move. And guess what? My landlord misgendered me in a text.

debraMckenz,asktransgender,My Journal of first 10 days off Spiro (before getting vaginoplasty),"*I thought this might be helpful for anyone else getting ready to have surgery. It was back before I had vaginoplasty. They made me stop spiro for 2 weeks before the surgery. I had been on full HRT for 1+ years at that point.*

*Names have been changed from the real thing.*

Day 1 - Everything felt fine this day although I did start to feel like I didn't have to pee as much. I still tried to drink a lot of water but I felt less dehydrated.

Day 2 - Pretty much the same as day 1. One of the times I went to the bathroom I did catch a whiff of my urine and it smelled slightly of a familiar smell from my past. Not something I'd smelled in a while. I also started noticing I wasn't ALWAYS HUNGRY like I had been before. I just didn't have those constant hunger pangs. I found by the end of the day/evening, I was becoming irritable and even lonely. I was tempted to call a guy friend to have him stay the night but I resisted.

Day 3 - Today I woke up with a slight erection. More than I usually do anyway. After I took care of myself, I got up and started getting ready. Before I washed my face, I noticed I had little red dots in some places on my face. I think these are an allergic reaction to the dustmites on my pillow. When I stopped spiro, I also had to stop my daily zyrtec so that's probably the cause. I'll have to throw my pillow in the dryer again to kill the dustmites. A guy friend of mine texted me a little while I was getting ready and a few of his comments turned me on. I think it's safe to say my libido has gone up already. =/ By 11:30am, I got ready to have lunch and realized I wasn't very hungry again. I ended up having dinner because I went to a friend's house. My libido felt fine the rest of the day, manageable. My friend had a cat and they gave me an allergy pill but I still was sneezing and getting a sore throat so when I got home, I took another airborne. I also put my pillow in the dryer for about 30 min before bed.

Day 4 - I woke up today with a mild headache. I drank some water but it wouldn't go away. I had to go get Tylenol and after a few hours went by, that had done the trick. Hunger has been manageable today. At lunch I was hungry and I was still hungry afterward. But after an hr or so, I felt fine. I had some grapes an hour after that and nibbled on them for another hour or so. My libido has been low today. No extra desires and it seems under control. Tonight Drew is supposed to come over and at the thought of what could happen tonight with him, I can feel my libido ready to jump in so it's not completely gone either. No new red dots this morning on my face so the pillow seems to be fine....although the red dots that were there yesterday are still there kind of , maybe slightly faded now. Later on, my headache started coming back so I drank more water. My hunger started coming back and I came home and ate some chocolate and I was full. At 9pm I almost made nachos but I stopped myself. It was late, 9pm...and I wasn't really that hungry. Just going through the motions. Drew didn't end up coming over and my sex drive felt like it was on the verge of being accessed plus I was feeling annoyed in general. I started feeling totally out of sorts, didnt want to do anything, I was annoyed, depressed, horny, frustrated, and so much more all at once. I finally just went to bed.

Day 5 - Today things were pretty ok. I was out on the town with my adopted mom and brushed off a couple people ""reading"" me. It felt pretty good that I could just ""not care"". Libido kind of stayed manageable from here on out....although if Drew would have showed up , I would have still been down. I wasn't very hungry most of the day but I ate some.

Day 6 - I noticed today that my genitals smell like ""guy"" again instead of the fish-like smell that it was. I had tullys for breakfast and mexican for lunch and didn't eat anything till like 10pm...just a couple cookies. My constant hunger has completely flown the coop.

Day 7 - Again finding my hunger not as frequent. I had tullys for breakfo and BBQ for lunch. I notice some hunger pangs in the afternoon but not very harsh ones. I will prob have something small for dinner. Everything else seems pretty manageable at this point. The first couple days, the T must have been a shock to my system or something but its getting used to it again.

Day 8 - Sweating like crazy! Argh! And I wasnt hungry AT ALL today. I had tullys for breakfo and tullys for dinner and lunch was gyros which just turns my stomach so I didn't have it. I did my last yoga and it felt good. Was starting to feel like the Testosterone was leveling out.

Day 9 - I woke up with a headache early in the morning. I took tylenol and went back to sleep. Headache went away by the time I got up. Hungry this morning but not overly. I got a rice krispie treat with my cocoa but could barely get through the thing....ended up feeling sickly full after that.

I talked to a friend who still has my ex-wife on her facebook and she told me about the pictures of her wedding. I posted about that separately but I felt really bad for her after that. My eyes filled up with tears...right there at work.

I had olive garden salad for lunch and some home made nachos for dinner. Not much really. Still sweating like crazy and at both the hair place and at Olive Garden, I felt self conscious....the look in peoples' eyes was one of curiosity which usually means I'm not passing. After lunch, my headache came back no matter how much water I drank. I started getting cranky and emotional at work by the end of the day. I cried about something else at work but I Forget what it was now. I ran some errands and went home and tried on my goods from Victoria's Secret. The bikini tops did not fit very nicely and it wasnt the size of my boobs as much as how wide my chest is in comparison. I was really sad about that and frustrated. Then I tried on the new bras. These bras are NOT ultra-padded but barely at all, slightly pushup but when I tried all 3 of them on, I looked in the mirror and I felt myself and they fill the cup and it looked amazing and I cried tears of joy. It just felt and looked so right for the first time in a long time....like it had a long time coming. Also I think the realization: ""I can fit into regular bras now!"" was HUGE.

After that I watched a couple TV shows and found myself unable to hold back both tears of sadness and joy at the events in both of those shows. I really am an emotional wreck tonight. Mom thinks it may be at least partially nerves. People ask if I'm nervous and I say no, I'm not .... but I suppose there is a part of me that *IS* nervous but the optimist side of me won't let it dominate me and cause me to worry....so maybe it's getting expressed in other ways instead.

Day 10 - This morning I feel very vibrant and happy. Quite odd. I was hungry but after the cocoa back to ‘not so much’. Wore a new skirt and got my hair just right so I'm feeling pretty and sexy and just plain good about myself. We'll see how that changes as the day goes on."

kernalmustache,asktransgender,Hair Removal Cream Tips?,"I just tried hair removal cream for the first time and it worked pretty good considering I refused to trim or shave my hair before using it (I have sensitive skin so my skin would become more irritated than it already is). The thing is, while a lot of hair did come off really easy, a lot more is only coming off if I pull it a little. It's hard to distinguish which hairs are going to come off easily and which ones are still fully healthy, but even if it weren't there would be too many to get rid of them all like this. I tried a lint roller, but it wasn't sticky enough. Will it all just fall off eventually? Is it a bad idea to try again tomorrow? Anything you can tell me will be helpful!"

SmurfsAreTasty,asktransgender,8 months in on HRT (MtF). I'm having sudden weight gain issues. Is this normal?,"I was down to 155 for the longest time and exercised moderately. I'm 6'0"". But all of a sudden I've started gaining weight the past two weeks and I'm up to 171 today. I even went to walk around and barely ate a thing and my weight went up from the morning. Getting really frustrated. 

I know there was supposed to be some weight gain, but I thought that was all earlier on. And it was just supposed to be some fat redistribution.... Or am I just getting fat because of these freaking hormones?!

I really want to eat a few cookies out of frustration..."
Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I feel like I'm Different (M2F),"I feel like I'm different than most trans people on here.  Before I write anything, I'm not on hormones and cannot go on them right now.  Now that I got that out of the way, when I read other people's stories and experiences with themselves being trans, I can't help but feel mine are very different.  For example, most people say that they felt discomfort at a very young age.  I didn't.  While yes, I was always drawn to the idea of boys turning into girls, I had never associated that with myself.  It was nevery really a comfort thing, it was just something that I was drawn to.

Also, I read earlier today about someone saying that living as a male is humiliating.  I don't feel that way at all.  In fact, I find it comforting because I was taught for so many years that was my comfort zone.  In fact, the idea of being treated as a girl sounds humiliating because that is outside my comfort zone.  The problem for me is that I find the idea of growing up into a man to be disgusting.  I despise the rolls and expectations that would be expected of me.  I also find the idea of having a son that will call me dad and a wife that will call me husband to be awful. 

The problem is, I'm not sure if I like the words mom or wife any better.  I don't know.  All I know is that I love the idea of living my life as a woman and I hate the idea of living my life as a man.

It just feels so weird though because my experiences feel so different from everyone else's.  It's those differences that make me think that I'm not trans.  Sometimes, I feel like I'm not trans it's just that I want to be.  If someone were to tell me that I wasn't trans then I would feel awful, awful, awful.

I feel like I just went on way to long of a rant.  If you managed to read till the end, please message me your thoughts.

Thank you."

tao-nui,asktransgender,I got a girlfriend. It's great... But I'm more confused than ever.,"Hey there.

A week ago I was about to make a post about how I got a girlfriend. At the time I was so happy, because I have found this girl, she's gorgeous, smart, funny, and we click on so many levels. I told her right away I was trans and that I was going to transition. And miracle happened, when I asked if it changed anything between us, she said ""Come what may"". Since that She said things like ""I'm going to teach you makeup"". She made me try her heels and I was just confortable doing it, because now I know she's like that, she likes me, for who I am.

But I have a problem now... (LIKE IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR FUCK SAKE).

My dysphoria as faded. Not completely, but to the point where I'm confortable being me. I still have the desire to feminize myself, but sometimes now it just freaks me out. My dysphoria is not as violent as it was a month ago, and I am not completely sure if it's just that I came to accept all these feelings or because I feel confortable being myself near someone I care for.

Now I am in this weird no man's land of mixed feelings between the joy of spending time with this wonderful human being, and the extreme confusion that it causes, and sometime a feeling of distress.

So... What should I think about it? Does anyone out there can relate? What happened?

&gt; *There are so many things that I don't understand*

justsallygirl,asktransgender,[PSA] Are you new to transition? Here's [almost] all of the information I wish I had at the start. Enjoy!,"If one lurks here long enough they see the same questions repeated over and over. It's not terribly easy to find information about transition topics for most people, though it's getting better over time. 

A little over a year ago I started organizing and collecting information that I was posting in response to people; partially this was for my own sanity to avoid copy/pasta headaches but also to provide our community with some organized resources. So if you're new to transition or in the midst of *the adventure*, the following content is for you. If you have questions that aren't covered feel free to PM me!

Transgendersecrecy,asktransgender,Desperate to get hormones,"So, I'm fifteen, so therefore I'm a minor (obviously), and I'm desperate to transition, as I've found out that fifteen years will give me a high likelihood of passing as female, and I can't legally get a prescription for AA independently without emancipation. My parents strongly oppose me and believe that I want to be trans because ""I think it's cool to be different"" and then they say ""Just because I read it on the internet it doesn't mean I am one.""

To prove how serious I am, would it be okay to go on a hunger strike for spiro?

Agh, now that I think of it, are they right? Am I taking this too far? It was only around three weeks ago that I had the realization that I wanted to be trans.

But every time I've been accidentally called a female pronoun I've enjoyed it.

I have fantasies with men in them, caressing me, but I still know some pretty girls. I just can't imagine me *sticking* myself *inside* them without getting disgusted. I can imagine myself kissing either gender.

Maybe I only avoid eye contact with them so they don't get the wrong idea. Maybe it's jealousy that they're cis *and* pretty. Stupid happy people.

I'm going through this conflict every day, but I feel good and confident when I imagine myself as petite and feminine, and always have. It's like my mind wants to please society, but not me because for some reason I have a voice in the back of my damn head that questions my decisions, telling me that my parents are right, that I should stay a cis male. I haven't actually felt a *consistent* urge to have sex with a man until like three weeks ago ago, but you know, I still felt confidence with femininity. Now I'm having fantasies every day.

So now a woman in me wants a man to caress her and kiss her until she feels like she's melting from the affection."
Transgendersecrecy,asktransgender,How to transition without parents finding out? How to get a petite body?,"I've been researching waist cinchers, as well as estrogen substitutes, but the results were nothing in the latter. Here are some of my problems: I have a big rib cage and I don't know how to deal with it, I am fifteen and already 5'7"", and I don't know how to approach my parents to help me get foods with high phytoestrogens without my parents catching on to the whole transgender thing. You may tell me to inform them about my identity problem, but trust me, they will belittle me and treat me like I'm their damn pet, which they already do. The situation will just get worse. I know this because my mom is homophobic. Also she's Asian. A *stereotypical* Asian mother. My dad tries to think for me, and every time I point that out, he brings up some bullshit about how I'm too young to make my own decisions. He constantly mocks me, makes fun of me, and treats me like a domesticated animal, as stated above. So telling either of my parents will just depress me. Ehem, anyways, I need to find a way to stop growing, and to shrink the width of my bones before I grow too much. Yes, I know some men don't mind tall girls, but I'm a perfectionist and want to be as feminine as possible; no room for doubt that I am female. *I* will not feel good if I do not look 100% female, and probably never will be.

firstusernat,asktransgender,Right Wing queer people???,"Note: This is a frustration post for not-right-wingers, not a discussion. All you Trump voters could you please carry yourselves elsewhere, all you third party right wingers I guess you could stay if you'll happily sing along to my anti-rightism tunes  

Do they not get it? Do they actually exist in the real world? Are they a grand community of internet trolls supplemented by a few real and bizarre needles in the haystack?  

My frustration at people that will vote for the people actively killing queer people, especially queer youth is surmounting. I'd get it if they had so much mounting privilege (rich, white ie the ideal republican) that it blinded them to the aspect of them the republican is trying to erase from existence...but republican trans people exist? Do they?

DerBelmont,asktransgender,Anyone here with Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD)?,"So... my therapist recently diagnosed me with Schizoid personality disorder. For anyone that doesnt know, SPD among other things makes you emotionally dull, resent social activities (they stress you out extremely) and turn towards your own mind. Plus it also causes  me a really severe lack of motivation that makes it really hard to consistently pull through any sort of changes in my life (its really a miracle I am where I am right now...). That kinda makes me unsure about everything right now because I had hoped that most of what I listed would go away once dysphoria diminished, and I cant even tell which feelings are dysphoria and which SPD anymore. I guess both kinda awkwardly fits together somehow, I still have the burning desire to be a woman, but I dont necessarily hate my body because I dont really feel hate? Somthing like that.

Does anyone else here have SPD and experiences with transition?"
Hayleybuggy515,asktransgender,"Tranzion, a promised land for trans people?","Imagine, a place where no cisgender people are allowed unless they're visiting. There can only be less than 1% of our population in cisgender people, so they feel outnumbered like we do every day, meaning they won't dare turn on us. We could be self sufficient, meaning no reliance on the cisgender world. We could cut ourselves off completely, besides sending our cisgender children older than 14 to the cis world and the cis world sending their trans children over 14 to Tranzion. A place where we're normal, in charge and not threatened by transphobia and death on a daily basis. A place where we can be free; our promised land. Thoughts?

Edit: Maybe I wasnt so clear in my original posting. This isn't forced migration, reverse oppression or anything of the sort. What I'm proposing is a sovereign ""safe place"" with a regulated trans-heavy population. No one has to participate, in fact if you're happy in the normal world I encourage you to continue to be happy there. However, some trans people live in places where maybe they have one or two allies and a few thousand bigots in one town. There should be a sanctuary, for ""refugees"" of the trans persuasion. Also I'm assuming someone more sane than I would lead this nation."

SRBs_FTW,asktransgender,Anyone in the UK had experience with gendergp.co.uk ?,"I am currently being seen by the UK under 18 service for trans healthcare, I am being maybe given blockers sometime in november of this year.

I was referred to the northamptonshire adult gender service in about april or may, maybe june at the latest. Given that according to this service, those who recieved first appointments in september were mostly referred in december last year, my wait for a first appointment will probably be a long while. I turn 18 in March. If I am still not being seen by adult service 1 year after I first recieve blockers I may be prescribed estrogen. I am looking at these times and although it could be worse, frankly I just want to get this over with and I am done with the waiting, having been referred to under 18 services a year and month or so ago. I have seen gendergp.co.uk and it seems like the sort of place that could be good in terms of getting a prescription for estrogen with less of an unbearable waiting time, though it seems a little too good to be true. Anyone know more about it? Any advice based on my situation? Anything at all will do, thank you.

Transthrowawayy123,asktransgender,I feel like I want to detransition but I want more clarification for what I may be feeling.,"I have been feeling crappy about my transition lately. Hell I've been depressed for the most part lately. This is what I know about me transitioning so far: 

- I'm 11 months on hormones and I like the changes 

- I feel like the margin to be happy is narrow for transitioning but the potential is higher(and the opposite is true for living as cis higher margin but lower potential for happiness(if that makes sense) Living as male fucking sucks compared to girl life there's just so much more potential. 

- I've been unhappy as a person since well since I started high school. I was homeschooled til high school and that left me feeling socially fulfilled(not really though) until I got to high school and I realized how socially inept I was. I barely made any friends moved on to community college where I commuted for four years and then went to a 4 year uni graduated without making any real friends in either case. I joined a club at the four year and was made fun of for my voice by a girl I just met. I HATE MY LOW VOICE. (So essentially I've haven't had much socialization with anyone at all. Except for a few special people) **All of this emotion ultimately pushed me to transition.** 



- As a result of above I feel like I've become severely emotionally unhappy. I feel things pretty intensely and teh fact that I'm unable to obtain anything as male makes me feel incredibly stupid and emotional and thus makes me seek something.  

- I feel more power/confidence as a girl. As a guy I feel like biggest stupidest piece of shit asshole in the world by default. I'm a punching bag to everyone. 

- I'd rather be in a dress than a suit. 

- I don't want to penetrate a girl or have sex with a guy as a guy. I just feel like I can't get into it. I don't like my genitals.

- I have always wished I was born a girl but not super intensely(since I was 9) but I have no idea if it's just a weird fantasy. I have also crossdressed for many years off and on through high school and college years.

- Whenever I feel crappy about my transition I see myself in the future as a guy in the third person crying intensely because of how much I regret transitioning and wish I didn't transition(can't have kids or a normal relationship/everything is harder) **The part that scares me the most :/**

I just don't understand my feelings. It's like I WANT to transition but feel so weird/awkward about it.  

Like maybe I'm just a sensitive insecure male who likes to crossdress. idk"

At various points, my mother and my psychiatrist have asked me this question: ""Why are you transgender? Why can't you just be yourself?"". I think it's possible that they really want to know why I have to be a boy and why I can't just be a super butch woman, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm also not sure why it is that I want to be a boy so badly, even though I have been very comfortably identifying this way for three years.

-Jen-,asktransgender,FFS In South Korea,"Hey Everyone!

So I am getting surgery in South Korea this December. I'm not sure if this will be of any interest to anyone:)

A weird thing happened: After posting my pictures on forums and requesting information about the clinic in question. I was contacted by them about 2 days later saying that if I would be a feature on their social media platforms, website, and a tv show they are doing, and that they would essentially discount the surgery by 60%, and provide a concierge service in return for me also documenting my experience with them.

I think they either see me as a charity case, or see potential for radical changes. I have no idea but either way, I'm comforted by the fact the surgeons will want to do good job if I they are using me as case study on  various platforms.

I wont name the place as I have been told I can't, but I'm pretty confident in them after speaking with many former patients and seeing their results. I also completely understand that a lot of trans girls would be uncomfortable going over there for surgery, given the language barriers some may encounter, and concerns about the final outcome.

Just to let you know, I am caucasian, not asian, and I originally had consults with Facial Team in Spain and also Dr Deschamps Braly in San Francisco, so I'm fully aware of the best FFS surgeons out there, but decided to change my mind after a lot of deliberation.

I am still getting my forehead done with Facial Team in the new year but everything else will be done in Korea. 

I'll probably do a vlog or send a link to my results once its all done and I'm not black and blue. 

If anybody has considered Korea for surgeries, I am happy to help provide any non biased information they need, since I have done a ton of research on various hospitals and procedures they offer. I don't claim to be an expert by any means, but I just wanted to share my story and what I know.

I'll probably document it on Reddit once I arrive and do an AMA post surgery or something. Jenx

SolviQorda,asktransgender,Trying to build a binder sizing app to make buying easier.,"Hey,

So on the request of a friend, I'm trying to put together a simple android app that would make it a bit easier for anyone using binders to figure out what size they would need to buy.

All the sites seem to have different sizing guides, so what I thought the app could do is:
--&gt; Show you where to measure.
--&gt; Store your measurements
--&gt; Use them to give you a list of what size you are in a list of ten different stores, with a way to click through to open the store you wanted in a browser.

Is that something that would be helpful? Is there any other kind of functionality that you think should go into it? I would really appreciate any thoughts. Also I haven't been able to find any, but is there anything like this that already exists?

It's made what I believe to be social dysphoria so much worse this week. I'm on the verge of giving up HRT and I don't want to. When I think about stopping I get even more anxious than normal, enough to the point where earlier my body was almost literally shaking uncontrollably.

Sorry for the rambling there. Did anyone else find that their depression got worse on HRT? Because I really don't want to stop. Ever.

I have this friend who was the first person I told about these feelings as an adult. I told them like over 2 years ago. They were cool about it and everything and asked non-intrusive questions.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I tell them what is going on. I tell them what I’m doing and what I want to do. They’re being supportive and positive and all the things I need. They’ve always been someone I felt like I could tell anything to. 

And then they made a comment about their partner getting turned on by it. And they made comments about them getting turned on by it. I sort of laughed it off, even though it made me feel somewhat uncomfortable, and they didn’t make comments about it for a while.

Until last week. I was freaking out over an unpleasant experience in a security line (forced to use the male line since I still present as male), and I texted them about being upset. I made the comment that I was wearing a bra. And that led to more unsolicited comments about being turned out. 

This is making me very uncomfortable. Enough to the point where I’m afraid to tell them any details whatsoever. They want me to visit them, and I want to visit, but I’m afraid to because I don’t want to be viewed as some sort of sexual fantasy. I’ve known for a while this person has these fantasies, but I assumed they would be more respectable because we’re friends. Granted, we have a drunken sexual history together, but ugh.

How do I deal with this person? I don't want them out of my life, but I'm tired of the unwanted comments."

courtenayplacedrinks,asktransgender,My approach to pronouns — is this reasonable?,"If someone I know tells me they are transitioning, or if I've just met someone and I hear their friends use a particular pronoun, I follow their lead.

If I've only just met someone and they look and dress like a woman I use ""she"". If they look and dress like a man I use ""he"". I don't give much account to ""behaviour"" because I'm around a lot of gay men and lesbians whose behaviour isn't stereotypical for their gender.

If I've only just met someone and there's ambiguity I discretely ask a mutual acquaintance whether the person in question ""is"" male or female and use the applicable pronoun.

If I was backed into a corner — like we'd all made friends with someone whose gender identity wasn't obvious and everyone was too chicken to ask — I'd find a polite way to bring up the subject and start using the pronoun so other people could follow my lead.

I've never met anyone who uses any other pronouns besides he or she, but I'd give it a go if asked.

I feel like my approach balances pragmatism (most people aren't transgender) with respecting the reality of diversity. Is my approach ok or am I being too cis-normative in some way.

any thoughts?  anyone else taking DIM ? "

[deleted],asktransgender,Did anyone else not really feel physical pain prior to transition?,"I'm not talking about reduced pain tolerance. I felt pain just as acutely before, but because I felt so detached from my body, I could just cut myself off from it. 

I used to get into trouble because I'd quite happily stick my hands into hot water to fish something out, or laugh when I tore my hand open with a lathe (afterwards I couldn't use one of my fingers for three weeks). I have a rather impressive set of scars on my hand from work from sticking my hand onto a basket that came straight out of a fryer. I just laughed it off and kept working (much of the tissue between my thumb and forefinger's now gone a dark brown and one of my knuckles has a largeish permanent callus).

I feel every little thing now, and I honestly think that because of being so disconnected from my body that I didn't really have the capacity to feel pain prior to HRT/transition.

Did anyone else notice something similar?"

searchlightdreamer,asktransgender,Help me plan my first trans related doctor's appointment? (MtF),"Hi! I have finally booked an appointment to speak with a physician regarding gender dysphoria! It's been a long time coming. I am quite nervous, but I think my excitement is starting to outweigh my anxiety.

I am going out of town for this visit. This is partly due to my therapist referring me to this location, but also for my own safety as I know much, much less people in this town. I have a very conservative (and nosy) family, as well as working in education in the south. I will take caution over convenance until I am ready to come out.

That being said, I want to make this visit count. So!
- What can I expect?
- What are some good things to ask? Or things you wish you had discussed at first?

This is an IC clinic, and I have a therapist's referral, for what it's worth.

I am mostly visiting for a consultation and to see what the doctor believes is best moving forward with where I am. My main goal was to get there, but I want to get a plan going. I am not ready for (and am not currently intending to) socially transition, but I would like to get the ball rolling on at least some small physical progress. It would be nice to at least leave with a plan for spiro or finesferide, or possibly low dose HRT.

In truth I don't really know what to expect, and my thoughts are running rapid due to excitement. I'd love to hear any advice anyone has. :)"
Daroniclis,asktransgender,Stuck with all of the blah feelings..,"For the last few months I have been reading stories on this subreddit. For the longest time now I have felt stuck like my emotions aren't quite all there. I get feelings of being jealous of friends who are pregnant, and feel that I wish I could be in that situation. I have openly admitted to a friend that if I could I would swap places with her. My biggest issue is I don't know how to pursue the feelings that I have. A big part of me wants to try and transition, but another part of me wants to not because of fear of being disowned by family, and possible problems with work. Parents are old school for the most part, and I am not really the greatest at communicating anything other than how work days went with them. If I did go to transition I am not even sure where to begin. Would stealth really be an option for someone like me? Who would I speak with and put myself out there?.. Sorry for swapping subjects and rambling with asking so many questions.. Thanks in advance for any words of wisdom that can be offered towards me."

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,How does one prepare to be ostracized?,"When I came out to my sister, she told me she knows that it must be really important to me to undergo a transition regardless of what people may end up thinking of me, because that's something I worry about a lot. 

I always knew I would be happier living as a female, but I never want to disappoint people. If you knew me, you would know that I'm always paranoid about what other people are thinking about me. I was made fun of a lot in elementary and middle school for non-trans reasons, all those years enduring bullies made me ever so mindful of every snicker or whisper behind my back, and I immediately think it's because of me. I worry a LOT.

So, this is one helluva can of worms I'm opening up for myself, and that's understating it. I'm not going back, I know this change has to happen or else I'm gonna regret it. Besides my birth sex, the one thing I've always wanted to change about myself was to not care what anyone else thought about me, because it holds me back way too often. Exposing myself like this, making me very vulnerable to everyone around me, may be what I need to not care anymore, but I feel like such a hopeless case, I feel like I will never change how much I care. Especially in the tiny Bible belt town I live in (not gonna move cause I love my family too much).

This past half a year after finally accepting I had to transition, I've made myself ignorant of all the people who will hate me, because not being full time, I don't have to deal with them yet. But that's a good thing because I'm always worried about the future! This past hour I was exposed to some spaces where they really hate people like  me. It was a rude awakening. I've been so happy about finally transitioning that I made myself oblivious to reality for a few months. Reality is a bitch and I feel like there's something I should be doing to prepare myself, but I know I shouldn't be worrying either!

Ugh I'm so conflicted atm. How did people here cope or prepare?"
irl_2016,asktransgender,"I'm gay, but I recently hooked up with a transguy. For the first time since I was a teenager, I'm confused again. What do I do?","So, I'm an openly gay guy and have never once been attracted to women. My first crush was on a boy, and so were all the rest of them. I've been with women when I was younger and it just wasn't for me at all, so I accepted that I was gay and I haven't looked back or questioned it.

Last week, I met a really cute guy on Grindr. He was cute as hell with a nice body and a great personality. He then shared that he was genetically female. Despite not ever being attracted to or liking female parts, I liked HIM, so I shared my concerns and questions and he was super cool about answering everything and being upfront. I ended up deciding that I would see if we still had chemistry when we met and I'd just figure it out as we went. 

We ended up meeting and very soon after had sex. We played around with oral and I topped him in his front hole. I was super attracted to his body and honestly the sex was about the best I have EVER had. I've been with straight girls before and had vaginal sex and I was grossed out and it wasn't at all fun. This was completely different and just...so amazing.

But... the thing is that I LOVE topping him, but his plumbing grosses me out as much as any other vagina when I look at it. When we have sex it's like a whole new world of pleasure, but unless I'm actively inside him, I really don't want anything to do with his parts. Don't get the wrong idea, I still make sure he gets his and we both really enjoy our time together. But, yeah, now I'm just past confused. Its one thing to not like girls, and its another to like a man who wasn't born with a penis. I get that completely. Do I actually like him or what? With cis people, it was simple. I didn't like anything about my experiences with girls, and I love everything about my experiences with boys. With this guy, I like so much about him, but that only partial aversion to his plumbing has me just so confused, especially when the parts I like are better than anything I ever experienced before. So it's basically like being at both far ends of the attraction spectrum, but at the same exact time.

I know there is no way to not seem like an asshole for asking this question, but I really am confused and I don't know how to figure it out, what it means, or anything. Sorry if I offended anybody with this question, I just don't know what else to do here. Figured I'd ask for help.

Thanks :)"
gaia1852,asktransgender,What's going on with me? I don't even know who I am anymore.,"So, I know I have been posting a lot here recently, but some major life changes have been going on for me. :)

So, I kinda realized something today. My dysphoria, or at least what I think MIGHT have been my dysphoria, seems to have completely vanished in the past week.

A few weeks ago, I was a mess, but I have started shaving legs and arms and face regularly, maybe crossdress a bit more than before, I have been dressing a bit more androgynously, and by this point I am presenting as female full time online (and with my vocie training, passing reasonably well) and you know what, I am happy where I am. And, looking at my referral letter for HRT, and the massive implications for the rest of my life it represents, I have to wonder what exactly my goals are.

Right now, I find it very hard to see myself as Rachael in a year. Like, logically, I can see that, yeah, in a year I will have probably started going full time, and all that, but I just can't see who she would be.

And with this lack of gender dysphoria recently, I wonder if transitioning is really the best road for me. That, looking back, a lot of my issues have less been me wanting to be female, more just... wanting to be less male. And, hell, I wonder if what I was experiencing was actually dysphoria, or just regular old depression. And, more than that, I am just confused as to what I even identify as. Maybe I am just a rather feminine gay guy, like my mom says?

Really, what I want to ask is; has anyone else here been in this position?  Could I possibly be non-binary, or just a really confused cis-guy? Do you think transitioning would actually do me good, or would leave me just as confused as I am now?"
fullmetalhusky,asktransgender,Just a bit of what's going on in my life!,"EDIT: Boobs and Butt warning, should of had that in the first time. My bad

So... my life's been a roller coaster these past 5 months since I started HRT and I guess I just want to get out their, on words what my whole situation is and see if I can get a bit of feedback or something on it.

So to start I've been doing this all behind my parent's back, because you know, on one side theirs my mom who lied to me saying she is fine with me transitioning to then refusing to call me by my name or use the gender pronouns i asked her too, even after I explained to her everything. Then theirs my dad who has openly stated that he is against trans and gay individuals because he just think it isn't natural, which first off sorry dad, you helped birth both of those things, and two I haven't told him since he has anger issues and I feel like if I did tell him I would be putting myself in the way of a fist and well... I don't need to have my face punched.

Now this has me at my current juncture and plan which is something I never thought I would do in my life. I'm moving out from my state (NJ) out to WV. Now I'm using college as more of an excuse to get out their, sure I could finish it here but it's toxic with my family so I will be finishing my education and history dual major with a certificate in special education their. I have a friend who I'm going to be living with who is transgender, bless her heart, and her two roommates who are pretty amazing as well.

So now here I am at my current college, typing this up, because I'm a lazy butt and honestly... even though I think I should be scared shitless I'm excited! Just being able to get away from all the hate in my family and get to a place that I can just be the pretty shy nerd girl that I am. Plus, HRT has been super kind to me I feel, [I mean just look at this!] (http://imgur.com/a/uwapk) and yes while my photo quality, smiling and, shooting skills is um... poor to say the least I think it progress! 

That's all that their is really, just kind of wanted to get myself out their a bit, get out what I'm doing with my life and show my progress which is you know... Exciting! Well I thank you all for listening to my crazy ramblings and all, please feel free to leave any advice, comments, etc. I would appreciate it!

As I am approaching my HRT appointment, I feel more and more insecure.
My dysphoria is gone, I even feel like I never really had real dysphoria, I just always wanted to be a girl. I never even felt really uncomfortable as a male, but if I had the choice, I'd rather be born as girl.
I don't feel like a woman, I don't identify as one, but who feels his/her gender anyway?

Right now, I'm feeling insecure. I want to start HRT, but what if it is a mistake? I feel like many, that I'm not trans enough.
Maybe I won't even be able to become a teacher, because of discrimination and so on.

cuttlefish98,asktransgender,should i detransition?,"So a little background I'm a freshman in college and I just came out as trans halfway through the semester.

So I went to my classes in girl jeans and some eyeliner and cleanshaven and a brah and people just kinda called me a guy still. so i told my proffessors im a girl and want to be called natalie. everythings been really akward since then and I've been wearing the same sort of girly not really clothes for like 4 weeks straight because I dont own anything else. Im to poor to get a second pair of pants. i had a job for a few weeks in the beggining but i wasnt getting my homewrk done then. so i quit. but anyways no money to wear what girls wear but im out and it would be weird to wear guy clothes again, although i still do it sometimes. but then it ruins my voice when i use my guymode voice. any who, im super ugly, already been on mones for 8 months so not much more is gonna change. i know i wont be able to get a job as trans. because im litterally so ugly i make ppl who thought they supported trans people stop supoorting us. i have a straight boyfriend who i always wear makeup and use girlmode voice for, so thats something to think about. 

clifs- trans girl has came out akwardly and looks like a hypermasculine man in girl jeans even after 8 months on mones, is unprepared with only one pair of girl pants, and has a boyfriend who sees me like a girl somehow.

I don't know what to do at this point.  I'm 18 years old and I've never been more confused in my life.  I don't really know if I'm trans or not, I don't feel like I've been through all the trouble that many of you have either.  I've only been experiencing dysphoria for about a year and before that I can't really remember.  I know I got reprimanded a few times for doing things that wasn't ""normal"" but other than that I can't remember any dysphoria until last year.  The only other thing I remember that could be related is that when given a chance in video games I've always picked the opposite gender if that means anything.  I've tried crossdressing a few times and it felt both nice and horribly wrong like I was some sort of abomination.

I don't know if any of these feelings are real or if it's just a phase.  It would help if the feelings weren't so intense.  I think about this way more than I probably should and sometimes I even get mental breakdowns over the state of my body.  I've also been incredibly depressed for a few years and all the anti-depressants I've tried don't do anything at all to help.  It's like they don't work in the slightest even though they are supposed to.  

I grew up in a really socially conservative household.  Well I grew up with my grandparents so that was kind of unavoidable I guess.  I got asked more than a few times as a young teenager ""Why can't you be normal?"" and ""Are you gay?"" things like that really didn't help much.  I also tended to be extremely jealous of transpeople when I was growing up, something that made me get really angry at them.  Sorry about that, I really feel terrible about it.

I am currently seeing my college's therapist but it's really hard for me to talk about things and even when I do talk about it it's really embarrassing and doesn't seem to go anywhere.  

I'm not really sure why I'm typing this out, I just feel like I need to try to put my feelings somewhere.  I don't even think this is the correct sub but...

pzzq,asktransgender,"So, the single friend whom I was really close just shared a bunch of really shitty opinions with me... I just don't know what to do.","It started with her claiming out of blue that a lot of ""girls"" pretend to be trans men for attention. When I've called her out, she told me that she's skeptical of trans people, unless they have official document ""proving"" they're trans.

Then, she basically came to conclusion that extreme gatekeepery (which is closer to psychological abuse here in Russia) is necessary, because ""what if some cis person hurts themselves with HRT?"". When I tried to argue with her, she also told me that trans people who are too dysphoric to get through the doctors to get HRT should ""get over their dysphoria first"" and if they can't, well it's ""natural selection"". She was extremely determined in her opinions and no amount of evidence of her being wrong affected her at all.

She told me that it wasn't about me, since I've talked to a psychologist (it was about mostly unrelated issues and he couldn't diagnose me anyway...) and that if I wanted, I'd definitely be able to go through that evaluation (which is really doubtful). It didn't make me feel better, since she still was basically invalidating my experience and experience of basically every trans person...

I'm just really sad. We've known each other for almost half a year and I really enjoyed her company. She always was supportive and accepting of me... I had plans to invite her to my birthday but now I just feel like cutting her out of my life completely, just like any other asshole.

It sucks even more, since I can't really make friends that easily and barely have any people with whom I can talk and spend time. And with her gone, I'll be even more lonely.

DerBelmont,asktransgender,Gender is a lot more about attitude than I thought,"So this is just a thing I am living right now, and I must say it has helped me feel better quite a bit. It's mainly for the people pre-anything and still presenting as their gender that was assigned to them at their birth.

See I thought everything about being a girl that isnt related to your body comes with hormones. Emotionality, a caring personality, good manners(lol). But after becoming a whiny and bitchy bitch and pissing off a few friends of mine(and after almost doing it again a few days later...) even without any hormones, I realised that... if I want to behave like a girl... I should just do that. You know just... show the people in your life that you like them instead of being the sarcastic asshole noone likes(and you know that you are one). Stop the cynicism and show fascination towards what you can do and achieve. Walk throught the world with a smile. Maybe even find faith(I know I did hehe)? I feel so much more whole now that my actions align with what I was meant to be. It makes my masculine body almost bearable. 

My mom once came into my kinda messy room and jokingly(or not. probably not.) said ""A girl's room isn't supposed to be messy"". And even though thats like suuuper cliché and stereotypical and whatnot... I noticed I became a lot more tidier. I can't really say why... a good 20 years of my mom yelling at me haven't done much of anything. But suddenly, and that may sound stupid, because being tidy and clean makes me feel feminine... I became tidier. It makes me feel feminine and just good. I feel like a good girl. Super cliché but it certainly helped my mental state. 

Now that was just one example, but I'm honestly convinced that a lot about being your desired gender is in your brain and can be adjusted accordingly with your attitude. And that may even help you cope with dysphoria, who knows. If not anything, it's gonna help you be a nicer person.

blueeskynoise,asktransgender,Why ask for my name if you're not gonna use it? [rant?],"So, I came out August 31st to my parents as FtM. I told them that day I would think of names etc and they assured me when I told them what name I liked, they would use it. (They also said they'd start using male pronouns that day, but changed their mind and said they wanted to wait until I told them my name.)

Anyways, I told them my name 3 days ago (It took me a while to tell them because I wanted to be certain I liked the name), Jeremy, after they were **getting SEVERELY fussy** because they knew I hated being called my birthname. My mom was a bit disappointed I didn't choose the name she liked, but said 'Oh, okay. Whatever name you want.'

Meanwhile, my dad had a god damn hissy fit over me not choosing the name Alex (I think he wanted me to choose that name because it's semi-unisex) and still hasn't really been talking to me.

When I told them my name they promised they'd use male pronouns along with the new name. No more ""she/her/miss (birthname)"". I told them it's okay if they got it wrong, as long as they made an effort.

They haven't even *tried.* Not once. No ""Her-oh, I meant him."" or ""(Birthname)-Oh, I meant Jeremy."" Like, they haven't done ANYTHING. 

I asked them why they were pressuring me so much to tell them my new name if they weren't even going to use it and they just kind of ignored me.

I'm tired of feeling guilty over being trans. I feel like I'm subjecting my parents to some sort of torture by trying to be *myself*.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I'm terrified of the Possibility that I am not Trans,"Sometimes I worry that I am not trans, that it's just a sexual fetish.  The possibility of that terrifies me.  I'm afraid that I am not trans, that I just want to be.  I know that sound contradictory, but it's my fear.  Last week, I posted on here on how I thought that I was different than most trans people, I still think I am but I was happy to know that there are many people like me.  Yet the doubts still persist.  I think the reason why is because in the research that I have done on trans people, the pattern seems to be that their decision to transition was comfort based. Like I mentioned last week, I don't feel that way at all.  It is based on the fact that I am revolted by the idea of becoming a man.  I do not know why.  There is nothing particular that draws me to the desire to be a woman, it is simply how I feel.

I'm worried that because my decision to become trans isn't comfort based, that I am setting myself for failure.  I'm worried that I will transition and hate it.  That is probably my worst nightmare.  I want to live as a woman but I'm terrified that I will end up hating my life.  However at the same time, I dread the idea of growing into a man.  Please help.

Also, do not mention that I should start hormones and see how they make me feel in the comments below (I cannot do that right now).

Also, I already see a therapist so no one can say that eithet.

VioletJane,asktransgender,Question about Estradiol patch.,"Hey I hope everyone is having a great start to the weekend! I'm hoping I will too.

If I don't get my new patches in the mail tomorrow, then what do I do? I don't want to go the 50 or so hours, until Monday evening, without any E. Can I just leave this patch on longer and hope for no ill effects?

finallybeing,asktransgender,Visiting Portland to meet trans people?,"Hello Everyone!

Ever since I joined the community here, I have been hearing about Portland and the meetups and resources there. I have been on HRT for a few weeks and I feel that in order to have a better mindset about my new life, I need to meet more trans people and make friends. I haven't interacted with many trans people and where I live, it's not that easy to meet people. Being the only trans people in what is such a cis world around me makes me feel very isolated and confused. 

As someone visiting Portland for a month or two, do you think it's easy to meet with the community there? Also, is Mid Nov - End Dec a good time to be there? 

If you have any other resources on the community there, I would really appreciate it. Thanks Gals and Boys! :)"

I was sort of hoping that either I'd fail boymode and then somewhat seamlessly transition into a passing-ish woman, or at least the dysphoria and the momentum of transition would have forced me too socially transition by now.

Is there many out there who were on HRT for longer before socially transitioning? Almost everyone knows I'm trans but I haven't changed clothes or pronouns. I'm way too self-conscious to do it.

Is there a chance I'll be like this forever? I want to live as my actual gender but at the moment the dysphoria isn't as bad as my embarrassment/anxiety about presenting female."
Falinlv,asktransgender,I am a cismale who historically identifies as heterosexual and i have started dating a friend who is afab agender. I need some input.,"Hi, as the title said i have recently entered into this potential relationship with a friend who came out to me a few months ago as asexual and agender. At the time i did this i had a bit of a crush on them, but when they came out it complicated things for me a bit. We are both college students and this happened a little before the summer break. We didnt see each other in person over the summer but we talked online a fairlt good amount. We became pretty good friends during this time and i think i sort of developed feelings for them again. I revealed these feelings to them a couple of weeks ago and they decided we should give it a go.

The first week we moved way too fast. I also have a lot of anxiety in relationships, and for me in this relationship that tends to manifest as an intense fear that i am misgendering my friend on some level in my mind (perhaps without realizing) and that my attraction to them is predicated on misgendering them as a woman. I really, really don't want to do that. The first week ended in a big anxious mess with me breaking things off because my anxieties were becoming too great.

A couple nights ago my friend revealed they wanted to try again. 

Yesterday, my friend and i hung out for a few hours and talked things through. I talked to them about whether it was possible to be attracted to someone because they had feminine features without that attraction causing someone to deny the person's gender identitiy. My friend seemed sure this could be a thing. So now my anxiety is more focused on determining whether that is what i am doing, or whether i am using this concept to convince myself i am not misgendering my friend but that maybe i still am underneath it all. 

So i suupose my question is this: does anyone have advice on how i could tell what's going on in my head? Whether i am misgendering my friend or whether maybe i am actually attracted to them in a non transphobic, non cissexist way? Does anyone have general advice?

Thank you for reading, and i sincerely apologize if anything i said was transphobic or cissexist. I am pretty damn uninformed on trans matters and i dont want to offend anyone. Please let me know how i could do better (or point me in the direction of some helpful resources) if i have mistepped."
Mossmise,asktransgender,Has anybody had an orchiectomy on the NHS?,"And if so, what was your experience with it?"
radiant-night,asktransgender,"Cannot figure myself out, feeling like I'm going crazy","So, I'm 21 years old AMAB and for the past few years I've been having intense conflicting thoughts on my gender. The first time I've thought about being a girl was 3 years ago and throughout the years it's been an on and off thing, I tend shut off the thoughts and think I could just live on normally but they always come creeping back eventually. One moment, I feel certain that I'm transgender and feel giddy and the next, I start having doubts and the whole thing topples over. I've decided to post here how I've felt throughout my life.

Since as long as I can remember I've always been a social recluse. I rarely spoke to anyone as a kid unless other people engaged me. I've always spent a whole lot of my day online on my PC, mostly playing video games. I don't remember any straight-forward transgender thoughts as a child. The closest I can think of is looking for female friends on online communities because I couldn't relate to boys and as a pre-teen, feeling envious that female video game characters looked so prettier yet I was stuck with the male because I was a boy. I went to an all-male middle school so I had absolutely 0 contact with girls. I remember feeling envious of my more feminine peers, small things like having neater eyebrows and higher voice. I used to wish really hard that I was more feminine and hope that my body starts to change but being an actual girl didn't ever cross my mind. Since as long as I can remember, I always got very anxious about one day having facial hair and hoped really badly that it never grows. As a teen, I always wanted to be smaller-framed and once again, feminine and felt good when I saw that I was smaller than other boys. I also grew out my hair long and pretended I hated being compared to a girl but I secretly liked it. Also, in all my sexual fantasies, I always imagined myself as a girl. This used to cause me a lot of stress as an early teen as I wanted to be ""normal"" but eventually I just accepted it.

Now, more recently, I strongly suspect that I'm Klinefelter's or something similar. I have feminine hips, very few body hair, absolutely no facial hair (even at the age of 21) and very little muscle mass. I have no reason to get it checked out as I absolutely do not want to get testosterone treatment since I ~love~ being feminine and I'm glad that even though I wasn't born a girl, at least I have these feminine features. The thoughts of getting older and stopping looking feminine, having to live life as a typical man, scares me.

The first time I've thought about actually being a girl was about 3 years ago. I was having a sexual orientation crisis because I had always felt 0 desire to date girls as a boy so I decided that I was gay even though I'm not really sexually attracted to men but I liked the fact that I can be more feminine and even actually pretend that I was a girl in my head. Sometimes late at night, I spent hours thinking about how much I wished I was a girl and remember once again feeling really anxious about the fact that my facial hair could being to sprout any day now. I always feel giddy when people talk about certain traits girls have that I associated with or when people accidentally use feminine pronouns to refer to me. I remember feeling incredibly euphoric when I went bowling with my friends and the attendant that set up our game accidentally typed in the female version of my name on the scoreboard instead of my current name and my friends jokingly called me that throughout the game; I had to consciously hide my happiness from them. Occasionally, I have dreams in which I become a girl with no repercussions and in each one of these dreams I remember feeling incredibly happy. When I wake up, I feel bad about how it was only a dream and write down the premise of the dream so that I can have a memento of sorts of the dream. I often imagine myself as a girl when doing mundane things with my friends, often unconsciously, and it makes me feel happy. When in the presence of girls, I often like to imagine myself doing the things they do as a girl. Lastly, since as long as I can remember I've had low self-esteem issues, especially with how my body looks and my favorite time of year is winter because of the less-revealing clothing.

I know that this is getting way too long and I doubt anyone is going to read it. What remains to mention are my doubts. As a an early teen, it never occurred to me that I wanted to be a girl, what if I'm just a feminine man? I also haven't mentioned that I've been diagnosed as OCD and I have very obsessive personality, what if I'm just obsessing over something, trying to find a reason why I'm socially inept and why I'm probably going to spent my life alone? Also, the worst doubt is, why do my ""dysphoric"" thoughts if you can even call them that sometimes disappear completely? Sometimes, I get tired of thinking and completely forget my body, just getting through life ignoring it, completely shut out any thoughts about this whole thing only for it come back eventually. Even stranger, occasionally when the dysphoric thoughts leave me I try to bring them back because I want to feel like a girl and want validation. I want to figure myself out but I have no idea how. I figured I should wait it out but it's been close to 3 years, should I simply keep on waiting hoping something eventually clicks and I make up my mind?"
StinkSupreme,asktransgender,Is transitioning even worth the risk?,"18 mtf pre everything, I've known that I'm trans for about 4 years, wanted to transition the entire time. But now I'm just worried that I won't pass and will just end up being a freak. What's the point if I'm just going to keep living as a miserable wreck?"
anonymousTgirl,asktransgender,I feel like cisnormativity in many ways paints a negative light on those who only want an orchiectomy- thoughts? NSFW subject. (Also little rant).,"A big part of the reason I made this account, was so I could anonymously finally talk about some emotional hardships I encountered related to me being trans. My other doesn't feel anonymous enough, so this is to protect the privacy of everyone involved.

Long story short, the only part of my genitals I feel dysphoria about are the testicles. And apparently, it seems lots of people find it confusing, and some are even seemingly offput or disturbed by it. I very briefly dated a guy I'll just call A, like just a few weeks as I remember. It started out with him praising me like I was some beautiful goddess, literally even describing me with that word.

But when he found out I just wanted to get an orchie and didn't want SRS he seemed very disturbed by it. He kept saying things insinuating I should either get NO SURGERY down there or get SRS. He then said something implying if I had no testicles but didn't get SRS that I couldn't feel sexual pleasure anymore. My other friend tried to explain that this was not true but he didn't seem to listen, and it didn't make him any less disturbed... I even remember him saying ""Keep your balls"" unless I want a vagina.

It all lead me to a new conclusion on cisnormativity: By ONLY having an orchiectomy my body VISIBLY moves EVEN FURTHER from cisnormativity, and I believe cisnormativity is why some people find the thought of such a body disturbing.

I mean, how hard can it be to understand? My dysphoria is 80-99% hormonal, as in related to testosterone. It doesn't mean I dislike my entire penis, just my testicles cause you know those produce more than enough testosterone to make me incredibly dysphoric.

It also made me think a lot more about dating as a trans woman. People talk about pre-op and non-op vs post-SRS trans women all the time, but it seems like people very rarely talk about how cisnormativity effects those who only want or get an orchiectomy. I also can't help but wonder, how many people out there, claim to like non-OP trans women, but if we just get an orchiectomy they get all disturbed? I hope not a lot... Yet I fear this isn't very rare.

How many people claim to be fine with non-OP trans women even so far as dating us, yet to me it feels like almost sadistically demand we keep our testicles when they are the primary culprit of so much of our dysphoria?

I mean If I have primarily hormonal dysphoria, don't feel attached to my testes, and an orchie is much cheaper, risk free and simpler than SRS... DOESN'T that sound like the LOGICAL thing for me to do? Especially when the worst dysphoria antagonist is high testosterone in my body?

So in a sense, even though I'm sure about transitioning either way, this makes me feel lonely. Knowing that I will feel whole, safe, and perfectly content with just an orchiectomy, yet so many people apparently only view my body positively if either A I have testicles or B I have a vagina.

Oh yeah, and anyways, he shortly afterward dumped me to become a priest of a certain religious order that doesn't accept people like me, cause being with a trans woman especially one that doesn't want SRS/actually feels fine with a non cisnormativite body, I suppose he felt wasn't compatible with his dreams of becoming a priest.

Anyways, this is all something that I've been needing to get off my chest for a long time. Because of the very deeply personal nature of this all, I needed to make an anonymous account for this subject.

That all said, anyone have any similar experiences? And how much do you think cisnormativity effects trans women like me, whose endgoal clashes with cisnormative ideals like that?"
ShadowAccountW,asktransgender,Need advice for shaving!,"This is [a question I've asked before on /r/crossdressing a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossdressing/comments/2eurn3/q_hair_removal/), but after taking a long break from shaving I'm trying to find my way back to smooth legs.

Essentially, every time I shave I end up bleeding on some part of my legs, usually just north of the knees. I use *Shick Xtreme3* razors with *Skintimate* shower gel. Some things to note:

* I typically shave every third day, against the grain. Shaving with the grain means I have to shave every day or be a walking cactus. The other problem, of course, is that the hairs can catch on my clothes which causes extra, painful irritation later making shaving even harder.
* I exfoliate during every shower using *Olay Daily Exfoliating with Sea Salt* body wash and a loofah. On days I shave, I don't actually know to shave before or after exfoliation so that would be helpful to know.
* I pat dry after shaving and apply *Olay Quench Ultra Moisture* body lotion generously onto my legs immediately after drying off. On days where my legs have a painful itch, I'll use a nylon bristled brush up and down my legs, tilted in the direction of motion, as a dry exfoliate.

I really want smooth legs, but between bleeding during shaving, ingrown hairs, irritation from clothing, and everything else, it seems like a losing battle. My therapist has suggested laser, but I simply can't afford it, and I'm not sure that waxing would be much better.

Do I even have options at this point?"

Sgeo,asktransgender,Could ASD be the reason I seem to know a lot of transgender people?,"I'm a cisgender male on the autism spectrum (Asperger's), and noticed that I seem to have a surprising number of friends and acquaintances who are transgender.

I suppose it could be confirmation bias, because I start noticing and whenever I learn someone else is transgender, it just serves to confirm the notion that I know a surprising number of transgender people. It's not like I've been counting how many people I know.

But I've heard that there's a correlation between autism and transgender, and wondering if that could be related? Maybe I end up in social groups more welcoming of ASD people, and ASD people are more likely to be transgender?"
ElitistHatPropaganda,asktransgender,Funny story...,"Right, in around May/June time, I met up with a girl for a date. We both had a super good time, and it was all very cute. But, she said afterwards that she had just broken up with her ex and didn't feel like seeing anyone at the time. We kept in touch and talked most days. I had just graduated from Uni, so with no job or place to live, I moved back home for a bit.

Last week, we decided to meet up again to hang out and get drunk, since I was in town to organise a place to live. She was very enthusiastic about it, but a couple of hours before meeting up, she said she had been recently seeing someone and they'd be coming along. OK whatever! No big deal! After about an hour or so, I was really obvious that she 1) still had a bit of a thing for me, and 2) that she had more of a thing for me than this other guy. Not exaggerating (or trying to be arrogant), but I was better than him in her eyes. In the sense that everything that every time I made a joke, she found it hysterical, more funny than anything he said, every time I said something interesting, she found it more interesting than anything he was saying, and so on. Not to mention he came in dirty jogging bottoms and had bad skin. I think after a while, he started being fairly rattled by all of this.

When we went out, we went to a club night most of my friends hang out at, so I went to chat with them most of the night and left them both to be amongst themselves. About a hour or so later, she found me, danced with me for about 30 seconds before making out with me. Didn't really expect it, but whatever, I went along with it. It was more passionate to be just plain drunk making out as well. Only about half way through did I realise that the other guy was right there. As in right there. We make out in front of him for the best part of 5 minutes. Still don't know how to feel about that - mainly weird. All 3 of us went outside for a smoke and chatted for a bit, but when I went back inside, I heard him say, ""Let's get fucking out of here! Please!"" and they both left (I'm guessing, went back inside and they both didn't come back in). He sounded super, super rattled :/

I told my friend this story and she said that she thinks this girl is just confused and has no idea what she wants. I agree. I can equally imagine our talking everyday fizzling out into nothing or us being in bed together in 2 weeks time. Also I'm transgender (MTF) and she's queer. Basically, my life is weird right now.

Tl;dr - Got made out with someone I went in a date with months ago while the person they're currently seeing was next to us. Was fun!"

helsbellz,asktransgender,"So after years and years of struggling to get help, I dont even know if I want to transition.","So I've repressed the suspicion that I was trans for most of my youth, and now that Im 25, finally got my doctors to listen to me, got a private therapist to diagnoze me and been recommended to the NHS for support, I dont even know if I want to even go onto hormones or pursue any surgery at all. I've made several changes to my body already.

1. I've lost a lot of my male muscle mass
2. I've taken permanent hair removal on my male pattern body hair
3. I'm looking into facial feminisation surgery

I have found recently from a lot of tests that I've developed a low serum testosterone syndrome, and frankly Im fucking happy about it to tell you the truth, I'll never be more masculine than I am now and I'm happy about that in a lot of ways. No more irritating erections is a massive bonus, no more sex drive making my body feel awkward. Im happier and more comfortable than I've felt in a long time.

I do still present female and prefer to do so, I still feel myself not to be male, I just dont know if I can bring myself to go whole hog on transition when my testosterone is so low it's reducing my masculine features naturally that were the big triggers for me.

The moment I have to put that legal ad in the paper(Despite most people don't bother with the paper anymore) I'll be opening myself up for harassment. (My deadname is VERY masculine, any girl with this name would be ridiculed for life.)

What she brought up was, they'll likely want me to put down my address.. is that an actual requirement? My parents and I already came up with a crafty lie we can tell anyone who asks in our neighborhood.. but I'd rather not just scream to the world ""I'm Trans and you can find me at _____!"" Especially since my dysphoria is one of the stronger calibur and this name change is one of the largest steps I need to get my brain and body to synchronize.

I envy those of you who can live with telling the world you're trans, and those that want to be heroes of the trans community but I am not one. I just want to go on with my life and be a woman with a deep, hidden away trans history."
amon_erin,asktransgender,I need help,"I'm sorry this isn't really a question, but I need help and /r/transsupport doesn't seem to get much traffic (I posted there, too). Does anyone want to talk to me? I'm so lost and  in a really bad place right now.

Quick rundown: Felt mostly good yesterday. Best day I've had in a while. Today started out okay, but it's currently at a voice in my head (not hearing actual voices) shouting me down and telling me to give up HRT. I don't want this. I think about having to go back to the life I lead before I started down this path and it seems so hollow. I love running on estrogen, I really do. My breasts hurt today, and despite this stupid voice in my head when I close my eyes and talk deep breaths while feeling my body I love that I can feel the starting of breast buds. Mentally, I've been better lately. 

If I truly were a cis male why would I get so emotional about this? I'd think I'd just accept that and move on.

I guess I need someone to talk to and talk me down. I don't want to talk on reddit really, but I have Kik. PM me if you want. 

I feel like a piece of garbage."
interop32,asktransgender,How can I ask for help/opinions on passing?,"I've been really up and down on this lately.

I have a friend who I feel like is really uncomfortable now that he thinks this might be more than a joke and really hurt my feelings with some remarks about my passability.  While I initially had some positive feedback on the passing board, one post attracted some negative comments.  Still, I did what was suggested and now...nothing.  I see imgur getting hits but few votes and fewer/no comments.

I'm new to Reddit so I don't know if I'm posting at bad times, broke some kind of unwritten rule, or nobody wants to tell me my nose is too big.  I don't feel like I can ask friends or family for obvious reasons and getting clocked in public is too pass/fail to learn much from.  I'd really like to know what's wrong, how fixable it is, etc, without blurting out ""hi, hit me with both barrels!""  Any advice?

KizzyQueen5,asktransgender,Having an anxiety attack regarding my identity?,"Hi everyone. I have come to terms with the fact that I am MtF and will be transitioning soon. However, I am having like a 24-hour long anxiety attack that began yesterday and I am struggling really badly. Hopefully someone (either MtF or FtM) can relate to this and tell me it's normal. Ever since I was young when I'd see girls in movies or TV shows I would emulate them. However a couple of years ago, I started looking up to one female celebrity in particular as a role model. I follow her on social media and during my adolescent years I would act like her and even imagine myself as her in my head. The thing that is freaking me out all of a sudden and that is causing my panic attack right now is like ""Wait, do I have some sort of borderline personality disorder?"". I sort of adopted this role model's personality and made it my own. It wasn't an issue however just yesterday this panic attack began. Is it normal to do this? Like I imagine in my head when I'm walking in the grocery store this person as me. And when I eventually transition I can visualize myself as her. 

I'm honestly just so stressed out right now because just as I'm coming to terms with my gender identity, now this is a new thing to worry about. The thing is I've sort of looked up to this person all these years and my personality is very similar to hers. It's like this particular role model is the person I want to be. I'm still a teenager so maybe it's because I'm still forming my own personality/identity? I'm honestly just so scared that i have borderline personality disorder now or something. Does anyone else have a specific role model that they imagined themselves before transitioning? Any responses would be appreciated. This anxiety is really stressing me out and I can't focus on anything other than it. Thanks :)"
Futurist110,asktransgender,Are there any non-OP trans-women and/or non-OP non-binary/genderqueer MAAB people here whom I can ask some questions?,"Basically, I am an aspiring eunuch who wants to become *extremely* feminine. Thus, while my own desires certainly aren't the same as those of trans-women, certain similarities in our desires (for one, a desire to eliminate large amounts of our masculinity) make me want to some trans-women some questions.

Also, for the record, I am especially curious about asking questions to trans-women and other MAAB people who are non-op (as in, who don't want to ever have GRS/SRS done). After all, I myself don't want to ever get a vagina either (though trying out a *prosthetic* vagina would certainly be a different story for me)."
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"Follow-up: I found a new Endocrinologist who doesn't treat me poorly, is very kind and warm, and less rigid and prone to low-dosing","This is a follow-up to [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/56eugw/im_in_a_state_of_shock_at_how_badly_my/), in which I talked about the poor treatment I had received at the hands of my last Endocrinologist.

**Short version:** My last Endo visit went terribly, but I found a new Endo who is very nice, and now things are looking up for me.  She's a little more flexible in terms of HRT, and a much much nicer person.

**Long version (I apologize for it being so long):**
Monday morning, my case manager called me to follow up on how the appointment with my Endocrinologist had gone.  I said it had gone poorly, and talked about what had happened, and accidentally began crying while doing so.  When I was done talking about what had happened, the case manager said that she was sorry that I had experienced that, and that that hasn't been her experience when seeing Kaiser Permanente doctors.  I agreed, and said that apart from that experience, I have been treated excellently by Kaiser doctors, and greatly enjoy the convenience of having everything in one building.  My case manager asked me what Endocrinologist I would like to see, and I asked which one has the greatest number of transgender patients, thinking that would be a reliable indicator of experience.  She mentioned the name of a doctor who had briefly treated me while my former Endo was out.  I remembered her as being warm and very nice from the brief time we had spoken on the phone.  I immediately said yes, and we made an appointment for the next day, and I apologized for bursting into tears at the beginning of the call.  Her office was a bit far; 2.5 hours away round trip, but located in a nice area, and I figured it would be nice to look around while I was there, take some pictures with my phone.

Just to be sure, I sent my new endo an email, telling her I was scheduled to see her tomorrow, and asking if the time my appointment was scheduled for was a bad time; if that would be hectic time for her, I could reschedule for a better time.  She said no, that appointment is fine, and asked me why the follow-up after seeing my Endo 4 days prior.  I explained to her that that appointment had gone badly and I was unable to raise some of my issues, and my case manager had assisted me in scheduling a second opinion with her.  She thanked me for the explanation and told me that she would be very happy to meet with me and establish a positive relationship in person.

The next day I got up early and headed to my new endocrinologist's office.  I arrived extremely early, just out of caution, because I didn't want to arrive late, and waited for a long time in the waiting room, watching The Daily Show on my phone.  I was called into the exam room right on time for my appointment, and for once the nurse didn't ask me why I'm 13 years late in getting a pap smear; even my eye doctor had asked me if I wanted to schedule a pap smear, and I had told each of them that there was no pap to smear; I didn't have a female reproductive system, I have an intersex condition called Partial AIS, and take female hormone patches.  Their reactions had ranged from a polite and professional neutral expression to one of mild surprise.

My new endocrinologist knocked on the door and came in, smiling, telling me it was good to meet me in person finally, and I smiled back at her and said the same.  I told her what had happened with my former Endo; I had rocked the boat, asking for Progesterone, knowing that half of doctors won't prescribe it, and things had gone downhill from there, and by the time I headed to the appointment that my case manager had scheduled for me, my doctor had been very angry to see me.  I now needed a new Endocrinologist, I said; I couldn't go back there.  She said she was more than happy to be my new Endocrinologist.  She looked at my lab results, and first reassured me that my hormone results are a bit off, but still a great improvement over where they were before I started HRT.  I agreed.

We talked about my [estradiol levels](http://i.imgur.com/OrnBDNq.png).  She said she'd like to get them to somewhere around 130-150 pg/mL, and I shook my head happily, but she mentioned that it can be hard to actually target a fixed number, with hormone levels tending to fluctuate.  I asked her if injections might be, in the end, the most sustainable way to get Estradiol into my body, bringing up the issue of keeping Tegaderm patches on my skin for years (but rotating them from one side of my body to the other every week), and the skin issues that might result.  She responded that she's a bit leery of Estradiol injections, and talked about how E2 levels can rise above 1,000 pg/mL during the peak, and worried that with such high levels, patients taking injectables are ticking time bombs.  And there's also a national shortage of Estradiol injections.  She said that hopefully in the next 3-6 months she can get my E2 levels up into the new target, and we can talk about injections at our next visit in 6 months, and she does have 2 patients who are currently on injections, so if that's something that I very much want to do, it's not out of the range of possibility.  I told her that sounds very reasonable.

Then we talked about progesterone.  I told her what I knew: that progesterone might help, or it might not.  It might even be counterproductive and stunt breast growth, and in cis women, P production started after reaching Tanner 5.  I told her that I'd read that Medroxyprogesterone Acetate was synthetic, and really bad stuff, causing nasty side effects, but that Micronized Progesterone, which is bioidentical, has fewer nasty side effects, and that when it comes to P, cycling it seems to increase side effects.  She agreed, and added her own emphasis that MPA is bad stuff.  She said that she doesn't currently have any patients who are on Progesterone, but that she's not ruling it out, and if in 6 months I'd still like Progesterone, then sure, let's see what happens, but in the meantime she wants to try and see about increasing my Estradiol levels.  I agreed, saying that sounds very reasonable.

She gave me an exam, and I was so thankful to finally be getting one, after 15 months of not having seen a doctor in person who might examine me and tell me if I seem to be making any progress as a result of the medication.  I took my bra off, and she examined my breasts, and told me that there's a little breast tissue in them, but not much yet; more in the left breast than in the right breast.  I asked her what Tanner stage I seemed to be in, and she said that in her opinion, 2.5 to 3, but that she wasn't an expert in those matters, but knew another doctor who was at another medical center that's 4 hours away round trip.  I've suspected that I might be in Tanner 3 for a long time, but my bra size is a very very shallow 34DDD, so I think my breasts are mostly fat, although my weight, at a BMI of 23 or 24, is not overweight by any means.  So there's always been some question there about what stage of breast development I'm in.  I asked her if my hips seem to be taking on a female shape yet, and she said they look more androgynous.  Ah well.

I told her how appreciative I was, and how I remembered the day she called me and told me it was okay to start HRT, June 29th, 2015, at around 1pm, and that I had immediately gone to pick up my prescriptions at the time she specified, about 4pm, and taken them at 5:45pm without a moment's hesitation, and it was now a kind of second birthday for me.  I also noticed that she was several inches taller than I am, and yet despite being tall for a cisgender woman, she was very beautiful, and that gave me comfort, since at 5'8"", I felt self-conscious about being taller than women are on average.  I told her that I noticed her eyeshadow, and how it has glitter in it, and it looks very beautiful.  She said thank you, it's NARS.  I oohed, and was impressed; NARS is fancy stuff.  We hugged and said our goodbyes and she left.  I went back to the waiting room, and told my Facebook profile how my appointment had gone great, and took a picture of me doing a thumbs up.  I left the Kaiser building, and walked around outside, taking scenic pictures for a while, then realized that if I didn't start back soon, I would get stuck in terrible traffic.  On the way home I stopped at a burger joint and ate a bacon cheeseburger and chili cheese fries.  I was grinning like an idiot after seeing her, and walked around with that same stupid grin plastered on my face all day.

By the time I got home, the sun was setting, and I was surprised that I had set out at 10:30am and only gotten back at 6:30pm.

Looking back on it, my new Endo is a moderate improvement over my old one in terms of how aggressively she'd like to treat my too-many-masculine-physical-traits-syndrome, and a fantastamazing improvement in terms of bedside manner and my ability to talk to her.

A day later, I emailed her about Estradiol pellets, telling her that from what I'd read, they seemed like the gold standard in terms of getting E2 into your body (seemingly being better than both injections and patches), with constant hormone levels for 4-6 months, costs that are competitive with the Climara patches Kaiser's pharmacy provides, and you implant them into a subcutaneous fat layer in a procedure that takes 15 minutes, and then put in a stitch or two.  She thanked me very much for that information, and I hoped that E2 pellets might be in my future."
OhmSafely,asktransgender,Being completely honest!,"Hello strangers,

So I just didn't know where to post this but figured this might be a good avenue. I'm gonna be honest for I don't give a damn about the he said, she said. Moving forward I'm a straight guy but sometimes wish I could be on the otherside. My big thing is clothes and shoes so many styles (Womens shoes are great many choices). I really enjoy dressing up on the low. The times I feel like having female gentials only lasts for minute or two. I like my manhood and what it represents but, wish I was a girl so could go out dressed as a female. So recently I have come to terms that I wanna keep this just as a private at home type thing. I'm interested to hear about other guys who enjoy womens attire and where they stand. "
TypingGarbage,asktransgender,Lupron Depot treatment,"So, I recently turned 16 and next month I'm going to a trans clinic to decide whether or not to take lupron depot before T... I read some of the side effects but I wanted to hear anyone else's first hand experiences with it. 

The only side effects that worried me are the stomach and digestive stuff since I already have those kind of problems due to stress(?) and I feel like it'll make it worse. 

So yeah. How was lupron depot for you? Is it a good choice? "
ehecatlinoz,asktransgender,PSA: Don't go cold turkey on Spiro.,"So, I just saw my endo to talk about switching from Spiro to Cypro (for boob reasons). 

One of the main things she told me is that Spiro, like cypro, should not be just interrupted, and you need to slowly reduce the amount you take. The reason is not related to testosterone levels, but, rather, electrolyte levels. Stopping spiro cold turkey could upset your electrolyte levels (pottassium, sodium, etc) and potentially be life threatening.

Just throwing this out there because I have read here before that its ok to just stop spiro and I used to believe that."
Rsvrdoge927,asktransgender,What is it about yourself that makes you feel one gender or the other?,How did you figure out you were a boy or a girl? Are there any certain qualities? Is it an overall feeling?
Alice5000,asktransgender,Had to use deadly force. What the fuck life?(x post r/mtf),"Tldr; had to use deadly force. my ex was crazy and it got out of hand, almost died. How to cope?

So towards the end of July I defended myself from my ex... He had mental health problems, the kind you have to take heavy meds for. Well he stopped taking them a few weeks prior because he ""felt good and didn't need them anymore"". I was laying in bed early one morning and hear a commotion downstairs. I wake up enough to realize my ex isn't in the bed like normal and I grab my rifle because I'm scared. It was propped up against the wall with one in the chamber . I always kept my mosin nagant by where I slept. Well before I could even get out from under the covers my bf storms in and opens fire on me with a ruger assault rifle. By the third time he fired, I just responded by firing a single shot center mass. I'm fairly sure I hit his heart. He stopped shooting and fell to the ground. I realize I'm not hit and I immediately telephone 911 and check for a pulse. I couldn't find one and he was barely breathing. Then I manage to throw on a skirt and tank. This all happened in a span of just a few minutes. I'm completely in shock. The police are first on scene. They handcuff me and I brief them on what happened. They put me in the cop car and take me to the station. After putting bags on my hands they cuff me to a bench in the processing room. I'm crying hard at this point but manage to spit out my proffered name and legal name and also throw in that I'm a firefighter a county over. The cop then says oh yeah we saw your gear, we didn't know who was the firefighter. I emphasized that I was and that I want to know if my bf is alive. The cop ignores my request and I start crying a lot more. As I sit there in complete terror all I can think is that I'm going to prison no doubt. Then after 8+ hours chained to a steel bench they come and unlock me. A female officer comes in and I ask her about my ex. She said he was pronounced dead at the scene and they had called off the ambulance. I'm now devestated all over again and feel betrayed by the emergency services. Like they had let him die. Why the hell did I feel like that? I knew where I placed the shot and I know I couldn't find a pulse. But still I loved the guy, I wanted them to try I guess. After I calm down a bit they take me back to the house to get my clothes and anything critical. We lived with his mom and I became homeless immediately afterward. I managed to grab my purse and my hormones and managed to bag up most of my clothes, but forgot my favorite skirt. Fuck that skirt. I had been committed to this man for the last seven years. Was engaged for 1.5. Before we got kicked out of our campground host job we bought a Texas heeler puppy and named him Buck Rodgers. He wasn't harmed durring the firefight thank god. But his mother refused to let me take him. We had a deal that if anything happens to him or I. Then I would take the dog since we were his parents. But whatever I just lost everything in my life. I even lost my job. I worked as a mobile mechanic and am a certified diesel mechanic. But all my tools got left behind and my parents have told me to just let it go. So I lost everything in my life and the only good side is I'm not dead or in jail...so now I live with my big sister while jobless and I'm trying to not sink back into pre transition levels of depression. But I'm only one year and seven months on hormones and I am full time but very much still in that awkward phase. All of this Is steadily beating me down. I am seeing my therapist but I don't even know how to live. I'm scared of everyone now and am always on the verge of a panic attack. Best of all my birthday is tomorrow and I'm so sad that I have nobody to just cuddle with on my b day. I can't understand why all this happened? Why did I defended myself? Why didn't I just lay there and die? How am I supposed to live with this for the rest of my life? How am I supposed to move on and love again? I so very miss him despite the years of abuse I suffered from him. He was getting better, he was trying so hard to improve the relationship but his issues got in the way. Hell I think I miss Buck the dog even more cause he was my favorite dog in the world. I don't even know why I'm posting this wall of tragic text. Maybe I'm hoping that someone has some words of encouragement??? I'm new to reddit and this is the best I can do while crying. But it takes all my willpower to be strong durring my transition. So how do I get over this tragedy so I can refocuse on transition????"
reallyconfusedabout,asktransgender,Kind of confused about my sexuality and would really like to hear your guys opinion,"Ugh sorry if this is going to sound a bit incoherent or rambly but i've never really talked about this before. Okay so i am a 20 year old guy. I consider my self pretty straight, I don't have any desire to be with a guy i thought i might be bisexual in my mid teens but experimented a bit, nothing serious just a couple kisses, I concluded i wasn't into dudes at the time, however the reason i thought i could be bisexual is because i often fantasize about being a girl having sex with a guy, but i also fantasize about just having sex with girls as a guy. It's like i find it kind of hot to be a girl having sex with a dude but i'm not actually attracted to guys, well im not attracted to guys while being a guy if that makes sense. I don't think i'm transgender either because i want to have sex with girls as a guy as well and i'm pretty stereo-typically male. I feel like im attracted to women but also the idea of being a woman and having sex with guys as a woman but also the idea of being a guy with a women all at the same time and its really confusing as fuck. I know this might not make sense but i'm not really sure how else to explain this. I am really sorry if this is the wrong place to post something like this but i don't know where else to post and really have no one to talk to about this stuff.

TLDR; fantasize about being a girl and having sex with guys while not really being attracted to them, also fantasize about just normal sex with a girl as a dude.

Have any of you experienced anything similar to this. This isn't just a passing thing either. I've had these thoughts for a few years now."
Zeuphrosyne,asktransgender,Cup size,"I started taking hormones 3 months ago now and my breasts began to grow slowly but surely. I am quite happy with what I got in only 3 months because I am only on 1mg of E a day (my endo wants to imitate at best a female puberty with the progressive rising of level of hormones because I am 17). Anyway, every month I measure my bust, hips, thighs, and breast to see any changes and I was wondering what exactly an A cup is because I am kinda lost..
My bust is 28 inches and my breasts are 30 inches.
I went on different websites and some say an A cup is a 1 inch difference and another says an A cup is a 5 inches difference, so it doesnt make any sense because I would be a B cup according to one and no way I am a B cup..
Thanks for your help!"
Throwawayok989,asktransgender,So confused. Looking for some advice,"Hey. I'm Jay. I'm 25 from the UK. And really I'm just looking to vent and if you can offer some advice that would be great. 
I'll start at the beginning.
Ever since I was about 5 I've been more interested in being a girl than I have a boy. I remember staying at my grandma's when I was younger and asking her to dress me up in a little frilly dress she had in her dressing up cupboard (full of all sorts of random clothing cause there was 6 of us that used to go there often).
Anyway I don't think I knew I wanted to be a woman then. I just wanted to dress like one. I didn't know why. I was a kid. 
Fast forwards in my teens I got into computer games always playing the female character. Had my cousin dress me up as a teen when I'd stay at hers. But played it cool you know made it so it was her idea kind of and made it sound I wasn't too keen haha.
It went all through my teens. When I left school at 16 and went to college I started drinking and went into an immense purge and blocked all my feelings and became quite depressed. It was a dark time. I considered killing myself. Not much like but it crossed my mind a lot. 
At 18 I stopped drinking as much and started smoking weed. I believe that's what saved me. I was no longer depressed. This is also when I started to grow my hair out.
I came to terms with the fact that I was transgender. But I have never felt brave enough to actually act on my feelings due to the fact I'm such an anxious person and always have been. Socially anxious. I managed to get hold of a nice dress and I'd wear this when I was home alone. And this truly confirmed my thoughts. I had never felt so comfortable in my own skin apart from this moment. Just to look pretty and go about my life I was content.
Eventually the purge came and I got rid of bits I had accumulated.
At age 19 I met my wife. This was the best thing that had ever happened to me. We met in an unlikely place and fell in love from the first second our eyes connected. The feeling in my heart was like an awakening. 
Up until 21 I would have thoughts but constantly purge them. Ignore the fact I knew I was transgender. I became really good at this. I was always worried I'd hurt my wife. Ruin the relationship we have built. She's my best friend. My only friend. We spend all of our time together and are the best team.
At 21 I lapsed and bought a few bits. After having them for about a week I felt so guilty that I had been behind my wife's back and crossdressed. This point I got rid of anything and the guilt dug into me really bad. I felt I betrayed her. Now thinking back I should have told her what I had done but I didn't. I still feel guilty about that moment now. Since then I haven't done anything apart from dream about it daily.
I have come to terms with the fact I could ruin my life by transitioning. And don't think I would have the courage to do it anyway. I'm happy as a man.  I wish I could be more feminine. 
The main thing I'm worried about is everyday I'm lying to my wife when she asks me if I'm OK. I fake a smile and say of course. I mean I am happy with us. I just feel dead inside. I have had a few pictures taken since I was 18 and they were my wedding. I look happy but my eyes are dead. It was the best day of my life.
I'm rambling now.
Long story short is I don't want to lie to my wife. Should I tell her I'm transgender? Should I get the courage to transition. I do look quite androgynous anyway so I know I would be happy as my true self. 
Should I just carry on and regret my decisions when I'm 50 thinking what could have been.
Should I tell my wife I want to crossdress?
I'm sorry if this makes no sense.
I'm writing this over the course of a day when I get chance.
I wish it didn't get me so down. I find myself thinking of killing myself a lot. I think that would be kinder for everyone.
I've tried telling my wife before. Like the words are there but won't come out..
I've tried letters but can't hand them over.
I feel miserable
I'm lost. Please help
Jay"
liv_rose,asktransgender,Wondering whether transitioning is worth it?,"Hi /r/asktransgender :) I just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. I'll try not to share my whole life story but here's the key bullet points.

* I'm 24, AMAB.
* I remember having desires to become a girl as young as five, but only vague fantasies. I never felt an objection to being ID'd as male as a child.
* Strong questioning of gender came in puberty. Expressed through secret crossdressing and repeatedly wondered if I was trans during my teens, but also repeatedly repressed those thoughts. Suffered depression (not life-threatening but certainly social-life-ruining)
* General life improved at my second uni. Built up the confidence to question my own gender without repressing it. Came to conclusion that I was in fact a trans woman about two years ago (most of my previous posts are from that time).
* Came very close to coming out as trans but questioned myself as to whether I really was, or if transitioning was for me.. Came to new conclusion that I was genderqueer/bi-gender.
* Have been out as bi-gender with my girlfriend and my friends for almost 18 months. Closeted with work and family. Have been out with friends in full dresses/make-up and felt great - as did receiving occasional female pronouns. Girlfriend is supportive but I can tell she still sees me as primarily a man.

Being out in this way has made me much more comfortable with my gender than being cis was. The label of bi-gender, I thought, fit me quite well. Presenting as female and being labelled as female by my peers has given me fantastic feelings of euphoria. At the same time, I can be comfortable presenting as a male. I have rarely experienced dysphoria in the sense of hating my male characteristics - there are times they even give me confidence. But a large amount of the time, I do feel dissociation with my body. I can get up and go to work in male clothes and be fine; I want to present as female, but most of the time it is only a nagging feeling, not an incredible desire.

When people explicitly ID me as male, I feel a little upset. Not internal-crying upset, but a kind of small jolt of unpleasantness you get from a stranger bumping into you. It has led me into the gradual realisation that I want to be perceived as female. When I ask myself what body I would choose if I had a magic wand, I know with 100% certainty I would be a cisgender woman. So I have started questioning myself, and wondering if being bi-gender is just me settling for transgender-lite, being able to express myself as female without the terrifying, life-changing upheaval that transitioning would bring.

I'm at a little bit of a cross-roads in my life right now. My partner and I are looking for new jobs and want to rent somewhere together, and I suppose that's making me question my life choices a bit more. On the one hand, I do know deep down that I am a woman more than I am a man. But I think I am also capable of living a happy life as a gender non-conforming male, which would be a lot less complicated. Is that just living in denial, or making a smart life choice? I'm not sure. And so I wondered if anyone else had ever been at the same point as I am - knowing you are trans, but not being sure if living as a woman full-time is what you want. What choice did you make? And how did you become sure of that choice? It would be great to hear other people's stories and know what you all went through.

Of the 1,829 who received androgen deprivation therapy, 7.9 percent developed dementia within five years, compared with 3.5 percent of those not treated with ADT.

Finasteride and Dutasteride are the usual treatments for prostrate cancer patients I believe. Should we be concerned?

Another weird thing with a different friend is that after i told him i was transitioning he tried to invite me to go to a drag night at a punk bar. he's a straight married dude but i think he might be a chaser since he and another friend were talking about Baily Jay and he seemed to know an awful lot about her.

panick35,asktransgender,HRT effects coming too fast,"I started hrt diy before I got the prescription for HRT. I still live at home, with all my old country high school friends that I don't get along with. I isolated and focused on getting an official prescription (I was 2.5 months in at the time). I've only had one friend but I work a ton so it hasn't been bad. Fast Forward a bit. 

Anyway I thought I would start to pass slowly, and at month 10 or so I could try to start passing. (I have extreme anxiety about passing in my town). So I got the official prescription and jumped in. Its month 7 now, and I'm male failing very often. Rollercoaster of emotions. 

Just today when my friends brother arrived home (whom I hadn't seen in a 2 months); thought I was my friends girlfriend! And tonight when I went to pick up my pills at the pharmacy. the staff referred to me as female the entire time! I was boymode too! at least I think its still boymode??? I fell apart with happiness that everything I ever wanted is happening earlier than I thought but I'm not prepared! I was supposed to go to college and do this whole transition thing 10 states away!

  I still have all my old contacts, faces, job, crud. People can be very bigoted if I don't do this right! Idk even know how to do makeup lol. I'm so happy but I'm not ready at all and I think something bad could happen. Idk what do?"
nrdgrrrl_taco,asktransgender,Wondering if I ever knew what real attraction felt like,"Ok, basically I'm struggling with the thought that I might be straight.

I mtf. I spent the first 37 years of my life thinking I was a man. 13 months ago I started taking hormones and transitioning to female. I've been living full time as a female for 9 months. Started progesterone a week and a half ago.

I never questioned my attraction to women and when I realized I was a woman, being a lesbian made absolutely perfect sense.

Then 8 months on hormones and something weird happened. A guy looked me in the eyes and I fell for him. I mean, I got sexually aroused, tingly from my genitals on down to my toes. My brain turned to mush and I couldn't think straight. And if there was any interest from him I would have melted in his arms and let him do anything he wanted to me.

I've never felt this way before. Not to a man or a woman.

It happened a couple of times since. Finally I admitted to myself and came out as bisexual.

Since then I've been on a dating site chatting with men and thinking about the possibility of having a relationship with one. And fantasizing. And getting really excited and really turned on. Seeing a guy on a dating site and imagining caressing each other, sex, laying in bed spooning... Oh god it's happening right now.

Anyway, I never felt like this with women. I thought I've felt sexual and romantic attraction to women, but never like this. There is a woman in a coffee shop who I think likes me and I thought I liked her. Now I'm starting to wonder... Am I attracted to her or do I really just want to be her friend?

I realize this isn't exactly a question, but help... Please share your wisdom and experiences."

Duskwolf58,asktransgender,"I am ready to start hormones, but am afraid of the negative effect it'll have on my family.","Alright, so I'm almost 20, and i'm FtM. I have been living full time for over 2 years and am fully socially transitioned. I've changed my name, my gender marker, etc. 
I believe that I am prepared to start hormones as an individual. i.e, if my family wasn't around i would have started them a long time ago. However my family does not believe that hormones will help me, and that I should be learning to accept my body for how it is instead of changing it. I do not believe that that accept im trans. They (especially my mom) think that it's a symptom of another mental issue. 
I know that this is bullshit. I don't believe them when they tell me that, but because they think that way, my mother has told me that i can not start hormones while in her house. I only stay in their house for breaks and holidays and stuff, and am perfectly capable of subletting a place to live if i need to. 
I really don't want my family to fall apart over this. I need to start hormones, but my mother is really upset about the whole thing and she's been doing very badly mentally recently. I'm afraid that kicking me out and having me ""kill her daughter"" will push her over the edge. 
My grandmother is another concern, because she is very old and has been having a lot of issues of her own. she is very concerned for my safety and very stuck in her ways. If i do this she will not be able to sleep at night because of her worry, and i'm afraid it may actually kill her. 
I care a lot about how others feel, so i've been holding off on starting hormones for the last couple of months, but i'm being stretched very thin. I don't know what to do, and we've been having family therapy sessions, but i don't think anything is going to come of it.

Izzabe11e,asktransgender,"My mum snooped around my room and found all my cosmetics and stuff. The lack of privacy is making me paranoid (literally). Is she invading my privacy, or is it just me overreacting?","I was already sure she thinks I'm gay, but now I'm stressing about her finding out I'm trans before I'm ready to come out, which is a long time aways. (I'm really not ready yet). 

I buy my ""girly"" stuff online because I'm nervous about shopping for that as a man... People judging me and all that... Well, my mum doesn't seem to understand that sometimes you don't want people to know what you're buying, and she always persists to know what it is. I say some vague thing about grooming and hygiene stuff (or whatever), but that's not good enough for her. 

Then I have to hide the things in my room in a drawer or somewhere, so they're out of sight. But she obviously snoops around my room because today she basically indirectly admitted she found my stash.

She just said something about how I should be careful what I buy online and stuff, and mentioned by name something I had delivered not long ago. I just answered vaguely like I didn't know what she was talking about and walked out the room. 

My lack of privacy and constant ""surveillance"" is causing me actual mental problems. I'm developing the symptoms of paranoia. And I'm not just saying that.

I am used to my mum sneaking behind me and looking at my laptop/phone screen or asking to check my history. I know they sound like things all mums just do, but it's beyond that. I am constantly looking back over my shoulder, (even when my door's shut and I know I'm alone in my room) like I'm expecting her to be there looking at what I'm doing. I am considering buying a lock for my door to stop her just barging all the time too.

I'm probably sounding like a spoiled kid right now, but it's seriously stressing me out. I'm terrified she will find out about me being trans, or already knows. I've written about it in my journals and she might have read it when she found my other stuff. I am not ready to come out to her (or anyone) yet, (I'm sure she thinks I'm gay anyway, but that's a whole other story). 

Am I just overreacting, or is she invading my personal space? (I wouldn't be so stressed if I wasn't hiding something so big, but I'd still be extremely annoyed by all this.)

I just had my blood checked and it's at 260pg/ml estrogen and something crazy low like 2 mg(?)/ml. My doctor, who works with many Trans patients, has been going over my results with me regularly and he doesn't seem concerned.



Looking through the posts here though, it seems like my e levels are rather high and that my t levels are relatively low (yay), but I wonder if the disparity is too much. I'm on 200mg of Spiro and I do injections, with the blood test at the end of each cycle, so I assume my e levels are even higher usually...


Anyways I'm just wondering if a) this is potentially hazardous to my health or b) I even need Spiro,  seeing as the e is keeping my t levels low

_Shaana_,asktransgender,Are we losing the fight against transphobia?,"I spend a lot of time online, and I feel like transphobia is arising from everywhere.

I see a lot of people lumping us with SJW and telling that we are no better than ""the guy who identifies as an attack helicopter"". 

When I see a casual conversation about us, gender dysphoria is rarely mentioned (we either are special snowflakes; people conflating feminity/masculinity with being a girl/boy; or delusional people ignoring reality), biological sex is usually reduced to chromosomes (while intersexuality is often ignored) and our high suicide rate is supposedly the proof that we are mentally-ill and that transition is useless (obviously, the shitty society has nothing to do with this). It seems like the vast majority people initially don't want to understand or sympathize with us. I feel like everyone forgot Leelah Alcorn and her message.

I really wonder, is the public opinion towards us really becoming more accepting? While far from being perfect, society is today more open to LGB people; but what about us? I feel like it was better years ago, when lot of people didn't hear about us and when being transfriendly wasn't seen as being sjw. Yes there were still discriminations, but I think the public opinion wasn't so extreme by then."

Okay, as the title implies, this is about genitals.

Maybe I'm in the wrong place (if so, please tell me where to post), but I seriously need some input.

I'm a 36yr old hetero male who lives in a relationship (12yrs). She may be asexual (really don't know what's the problem), so we don't make sex. Yes. Never. Nothing.

I know, I can step down, but somehow I can't. We tried to fix this many times with no success.

The problem is, I'm a closet crossdresser since about 17 yrs. This, and the problem above is causing real problems for me. While she knows my crossdresser side, because we don't make sex, I can't dress with her, so I should do it when I'm alone.

Now I really don't care about ""real"" sex, but fantasizing about a male partner. I'm almost 100% sure that I couldn't make it while I'm a man, but while dressed as a woman? Hell yes! Not long ago, I thought I can do with a male in a MMF-threesome, now I don't really care just want to look pretty and do everything for someone who value my devotion.
As I said, I'm crossdressing since about 17yrs. I've experienced many problems since then, but one thing is sure. It's getting worse year by year. Starting from when should I seriously think about I'm trans? I know this sounds like a very silly conclusion, but thinking about going the trans route isn't started yesterday.

MightBeMagic,asktransgender,(Possibly Urgent?) Lasting rib discomfort after binding.,"(cross-posting from /r/ftm since I've had no luck there)
So I've been binding for about 4-5 years and have never had any real problems. (I used to use one of those cheap $8 binders from ebay, that one hurt so I switched to Underworks, and I've since switched from that to a GC2B half binder)

But since Sunday evening (Oct 16th) I've had this weird rib discomfort that won't go away? (I wasn't binding for long or doing any activity. I wore it for 3 hours to go see a movie) It hasn't necessarily gotten WORSE, just more and more infuriating as it won't go away or get better. It's not really pain, just discomfort. Like as if someone was lightly grabbing the bottom ribs on my right side, and I've found myself having trouble breathing because I can't really expand my ribcage much.

I was hoping it'd sort itself out, but since nothing has changed in close to a week, I'm not sure what to do. Ive gotten almost no sleep because I can't get comfortable, and I can't sit for very long because it puts pressure on my ribs and causes shortness of breath. I'm going to see a doctor this afternoon, but I live in a small rural town and I don't really trust them to figure out what's wrong with me, so I was hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction.

I've tried googling the problem, but everything I've found talks about sharp pain, not weird discomfort. I'm kind of out of ideas, so any help anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Went to see my doctor, but she really had nothing helpful to say and basically told me she has no clue what's wrong. Gave me some Aleve and antibiotics in the hopes that it'll fix it, but I'm feeling doubtful and I've tried taking the Aleve and ibuprofen and nothing has helped."

Clarnico,asktransgender,What to do about comments at work?,"(Just a bit of background info, I've been at my job 3 months. When they showed me around they made me use my deadname, so a few people know it, but have always presented as myself. Most of my coworkers are 40+ cis men, if the attitude when they grew up changes anything)

There's often a bit of ""banter"" (almost always short jokes because I may as well be a hobbit...) but today I feel like it went too far. 

One coworker always...speaks his mind . Let's call him Douchecanoe: *""You're a weird little freak, aren't you?""* It really stang. I got picked on a lot as a kid, but honestly thought a 50 year old would have a shred more tact and maturity than the assholes on the playground. 
I've had lots of little comments, but it's the first time anyone has been that direct in real life (besides probably drunk idiots yelling at me in bathrooms). Douchecanoe has also brought up my trans-ness (for lack of a better word) several times even though I've made it clear I don't want to talk about it (I just want to be seen like anyone else, and not treated as a ""freak"". Looks like that didn't work)

Other coworkers keep misgendering me. They saw me *once* before but don't seem to care they've known me for 3 months as a person rather than some sort of act. I present as masculinely as I can, but given my features and proportions will probably never pass as a cisgender male (additional random question, is there a male equivalent of FFS? I'm terrified I'll be stuck ""halfway"" forever.) 

Later I heard this vile conversation about a transfeminine celebrity (assuming Caitlyn Jenner). They make crude comments about ""how a bloke got all that work done to look female"" and these shitty comments about ""desecrating one's body"" and how people ""are the way they're born and shouldn't change that."" They know I'm trans yet still said it. Bunch of smegheads. 

What is it with people's obsessions over what parts strangers have between their legs? 

It just hit home what assholes think, how I'll always be a freak to them. I just feel so alone. There's nobody else remotely close to my age, yet alone trans (it was mentioned it's the first time the company has had to deal with it, so guessing I'm alone). I moved away and live in a tiny flat and haven't had a proper conversation with someone who doesn't think I'm a freak for a long time. Sorry for the rant, I'm just lonely, kind of down (had to come off antidepressants because the side effects were causing worse problems), and kind of pissed off with how it feels like the world is full of assholes. I tried finding a ""real life"" support group. The youth one was too ""edgy"" (was basically a lesson telling a bunch of 13(ish) year olds that drugs are bad); and most non-youth group ones seem to be almost exclusively for trans women and/or in big cities...

I have no idea how to make friends and just feel so alone.

 Am I overreacting here? I just ignored everything and put my headphones back on, pretended I didn't hear. I don't want to get people fired, but at the same time I don't want this to become an ongoing thing...

Sorry for the rant!"
-Naven-,asktransgender,"Used to use dysphoria as a tool to figure out my path to transition. It's not as bad anymore and I feel lost. Additionally, I don't know if I should stop puberty blockers for ~3 months to bank sperm. :(","For years, I have had depression, anxiety, and (of course) gender dysphoria. While dysphoria sucks and is annoying, it helped me figure out what I wanted to do and how I wanted to transition. After about 6 months on puberty blockers, I am happier than ever. I don't have nearly as much dysphoria especially considering that I am growing my hair out (very slowly). Even though I can make the connection that the more feminine I get, the happier I seem to become, I worry that I am wrong and this transgender stuff is all just a phase or I am making it up or something like that. I would hate to masculinize and get back into male puberty again (however when I ask myself why would I not like it, it confuses me because it throws me back into a loop of uncertainty). In other words, I question literally everything I think regarding transgender stuff and it makes me doubt myself more. My dysphoria was helpful in the way that it let me know that I needed to fix something and gave me guidance(such as transition). Because I don't have as much dysphoria, I'm getting really nervous. As I become more comfortable with myself, I worry that I am not actually transgender. Please note, all my dysphoria is not gone, there is just significantly less.


Additionally, I don't know if I want to bank sperm. I would love to, but I would have to get off puberty blockers for about 3 months (or maybe longer). I'm so close to getting on estrogen and starting HRT that I feel like stopping the puberty blockers would reset all my progress. In the past, I just told myself that because I'm bisexual, I would just marry a man and there wouldn't be that much use for the sperm. The second most likely outcome is if I end up in a lesbian relationship, in which case the sperm would come in handy. I also worry that I might end up preferring women (I am attracted to males and females, however I feel more attracted to woman; maybe?). I have thought about it and came to the conclusion that I could always adopt a child, however having a biological child is pretty important to me. For such a long time now, I have been set on transitioning, and I still am, however I have been waiting so long for this yet I feel so guilty (?) and nervous / doubtful / uncertain.


I want to start HRT and see if it's right for me (which I am almost 100% it will), however if it isn't, I'm also anxious about having to tell everyone it was just a false alarm. How is it possible that I could have had gender dysphoria for such a long amount of time (just didn't become significant until puberty) and now it wanes and is negligible (maybe a little bit more). 


Could anyone ask me a few questions regarding how I feel and my dysphoria, maybe I just need to hear other people's opinions?

cl_g,asktransgender,Doubting myself,"This is the first time I've ever talked about any of this, I had always been scared of telling others about it, so it's hard to really put all of my thoughts together.

I'm in my mid-20s, born male. For a long time (at least over 10 years now) I've often fantasized about being female, thinking at times that it would've been nice to have been born female, but I had never really seriously considered the possibility of being transgender until recently. I guess I sort of convinced myself that it would be some sort of ""phase"" I would grow out of, that obviously I must be male and I would come to fully accept that... which obviously never ended up happening. I've also always had doubts about my sexual orientation, which, I guess got most of my focus and blinded me to my bigger issues with my gender identity.

Over the past year I've had some acquaintances come out as female. One of them last month posted a picture of her current progress, and I couldn't stop thinking about how great she looked, which made me realize: I was jealous. Jealous of how she decided to change herself and come out as who she truly is, while I was still trying to deny myself of who I want to be. Since then I've thought about it more and more, seriously thinking about how deep down I want to be female, of how much happier I'd be being able to finally understand myself if I can fully accept it.

But... I just can't bring myself to do it. I just can't help but have doubts about it. I don't know if it's just that it sounds too good to be true, that I could actually truly be female and be happy. I can't help but deny it still; that I had been male my entire life up until now, which I've been uncomfortable with at times but still can't convince myself that it was all a ""lie"", that there's possibly some part of me that would still want to be male and I would come to regret the decision. This has started to severely stress me out the past few days, making it difficult to focus on anything else, and I'm honestly terrified of talking to anyone I know about this. I just want to be able to finally understand myself so desperately, to know for sure if I'm actually female, or if I'm all wrong about myself and I really am male, or if I'm something in between. Does anyone have any advice for what I can do here, what can help me determine what I am?"

SammyXO7,asktransgender,My dad is the only one who still calls me by my old name,"Literally everyone I interact with has tried to use my new name and pronouns. For my mom, she still slips up from time to time, but she's trying, and I can see the effort. My friends, coworkers, classmates, all call me by my new name. I've told my dad multiple times to stop, especially in public, to no avail. 

I really can't take it anymore. It's been 6 months, and not once has he used my new name. Not even tried to. Is it too harsh to cut him out of my life, at least until he changes? I've never really been close with him and we've always had issues, but ever since I came out a year and a half ago, he's treated me differently. What should I do?

It worked sooooo well, I felt so smooth! 

BUT it's definitely a men's branded shave cream. HEAVY masculine scent to it. It makes me smell like my grandfather, the manliest man I know and I am super not into that.

raphmer,asktransgender,Guess I'll have to give up,"So, to make things short, I think about cancelling my HRT appointment next month.

During the last months, I came out to those who are close to me. They've all been understanding and supportive, even my girlfridn said she'd support me.
Actually, she doesn't. Today I went to bank sperm, we had a huge fight before and after. I can't imagine how it's gonna be when I start HRT.

As you can read in my former posts, I always had to decide if it's her or HRT. 
I mean I love her, and to be honest, if we break up, she'll have problems paying her bills, which means that she has to rely on me. I just can't separate from her. If I knew she had somebody else and that her life would be easy, it would be somehow easier for me to break up. Apart from the fact that I love her...

As for now, I have been looking forward to HRT. It made me happy, I finally had something to look forward to in life. Then there were these moment where she told me that she can't be with a girl and that she can't see how I 'destroy me body'.
These are the moments that depress me the most. The feeling of being torn apart and having to chopse betwen her and myself. At these times, I'm mostly thinking about ending my life in order not to take a decision. It's even worse than dysphoria.

Right now, even though I'm not sure, I guess I have to cancel the appointment and live on this shitty life. No matter which way I choose, there's always sadness and loss, so why not chosing the way I already know? Maxbe we won't stay together for long, maybe dysphoria will become even worse... who knows.

Tomorrow is my 26th birthday. One more year in a life I want to change, but I just can't because of the girl I love. All I wish for is that she lets me go my way and tries to stand behind me, trying to love anf support me. She knows it's the only thing I ever wanted.

I'm born male, 19 years old and I'm like so confused. When I watch various trans YouTubers, I can't help be feel different? Like I feel way way way more feminine and womanly than male? I don't wish to have like breasts or a vagina and stuff like that - but in the moment I feel out of place? I'm already a feminine man too. It's just every now and then for short periods of time (like not even an hour at a time) I feel different.  
  
Hasn't really be happening for long. And I should also mention I do drag, however I see that as an alter ego that I take off and for performances etc if that makes sense.

eyelashesthatcutyou,asktransgender,Was a month of HRT enough,"Hello!  Posting on a throwaway here.  Late 20's MtF here, living in a very conservative state.  I've experienced gender dysphoria my whole life, I just didn't know what it was until a few years ago.  Since then, I've been blocked at every turn by therapists and doctors who would rather pump me full of antidepressants and have me in every month for blood tests and anything else they can bill my insurance.

I have been talking to other trans people online and in support groups, and I've managed to find a counselor who can get me a letter for about $200.  Of course, then I'd need to go back to my doctor and make yet another argument for why I need HRT.  Then more bloodwork of course, and the whole dance continues (only this time with prescriptions that *should* help what I'm going through).  I will admit I have suffered from major depression for about 10 years now.  In that time, I have tried nearly every antidepressant on the market and they have been almost entirely ineffective.  I have been off all SSRIs and other meds for over a month now, and the one constant in all of this has been my dysphoria.

I have heard that most people who go on HRT often know very soon whether it's right for them or not.  My friend said he knew right away that testosterone was what he had been missing since puberty (I've always had very low T).

I know it's not wise, but I am running out of options, and I just do not have the ability to weather another year of medical professionals dragging their feet and bogging me down in bills and red tape just to see if this is actually what has been causing all of these feelings for so long.  Since my last round of bloodwork a few months ago was a-okay (aside from low T), I have been knocking around the idea of either going to a clinic and using informed consent, or going online and getting a month's worth of low dose HRT.  I could get a month's worth of pills for $50 or so, and I feel like I should get at least some resolution from that.  Or, I could continue to spin my wheels and spend my money without ever finding out if HRT could help.

TL,DR: Was a month of HRT enough to know you made the right choice?

EDIT!!!  Thank you so much for the kind words and advice.  I'm going to contact the clinic and go the informed consent route.  I've got nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Thank you!"
rosalievivos,asktransgender,I feel like I'm not part of the trans community,"Ok let my start this off by stating the obvious. I am transgender. But I've never met someone like me before. like super passing wise I don't mean this in a pretentious way but many of the trans people I meet started a long time after me. Ive only JUST turned 19, Ive been on hormones for a long time, I pass 100% of the time, and I'm in one of the top sororities in my University. Right now none of my friends, or boyfriends, or anyone in my sorority  know that I am transgender. I've never met a ""stereotypical"" college girl like me that passes just as well and goes to parties and mixers and frat events and is in my age range. (I'm also having srs in 8 days , paid for by insurance!) idk, I mean I've been living deep stealth for a long time.  I've never met another transgender person that's exactly the same as me (and I don't mean this in a mean way) it's just that I'm 5'4 and most other trans girls are taller. Or they can't get surgery paid for. Or they have passing problems. And other people have other problems too. Like I feel like my transition was handed to me on a silver spoon and I feel bad because I grew up in California I guess I don't have the problems as the other ones. Am I still part of the trans community? I feel almost like I'm not. Because most people are worried about looks and stuff but sometimes I think blending in completely is even harder. :/ I think maybe living extreme stealth has givin me depression and anxiety too :( "

Calypso57,asktransgender,Is anyone here not a liberal? Anyone also not a feminist?,"I feel kind of secluded lol. I guess I might lean toward liberalism a tad bit but I'm pushed back to elsewhere from the abundance of uneducated liberals (I'm talking universally lol not y'all) who really have nothing to say besides play victim to every action and bandwagon everything media puts out and isolate themselves to feel special.

This is similar with feminism. What was a movement about equality has become his thing of just demeaning and demoralizing men in a really cruel way. Feminism has now secluded itself in this area in which most women ignore. There was this huge poll in which around 92% of women were for equality but only 7% or less even followed feminism. On paper feminism is just equality though anyway but in reality that isn't really what it is anymore. People are crying rape when no one has raped them which is just demoralizing actual rape victims and on top of that just making themselves look worse. There is no wage gap... I mean it's obvious to look at the countless times it has been debunked because women obviously are more likely to stay at home, work part time, work less etc. I get confused when feminists think this is an attack saying that women can't work full time and work more then men. They can! I mean when I get a job I will! It's just that the majority don't. Also nowadays women are getting hired over men! If we want equality we should be rooting for men to be equally accepted in jobs. (Technically depends on the job but I'm talking more average/middle-end jobs. Not really janitors, construction workers, garbage men etc)

Anyway I'm not going to keep ranting lmfao hopefully this isn't too long everyone ignores it. Or anyone just goes straight to the comment section and attack me."

I don't feel too badly about the way I *looked* then necessarily, but every time I see a picture of me as a toddler wearing a dress or something like that, I start to feel almost physically sick. For me I guess it's less about seeing a female body than it is about seeing what is technically myself behaving like a feminine girl.

Japanbracheck,asktransgender,I hope this is the right place to ask- I am not trans but want to find out about binders,"I am very sorry if this post is inappropriate for this sub.

I am deeply uncomfortable with the movement of my breasts. I totally hate them and they interfere with my work and life all the time. I am a 32H and have been busty since childhood. I have a shoulder injury and have chronic nerve pain as a result, bra straps are a daily agony.

I'm cross posting this message after being directed here from /r/aBraThatFits.

Here is the relevant content of my original post:

I live in Japan where my bust is the (very much hated) recipient of a huge amount of unwanted staring and comments. I cannot buy bras anywhere except the internet here it seems.

I have been attacked and sexually molested on the street and train as a result of my breasts. I have also be catcalled and followed in my home country and here. I hate my bust with a passion and would love to get it all surgically removed, but that is not an option financially. I am 35 and have been dealing with this since my teens, so I doubt it's something I'm going to grow into being ok about.

Measurements are: 
Snug Underbust: 32.5 inches 
Tight Underbust: 31.5 inches 
Standing Bust: 42 inches 
Leaning Bust: 45 inches 
Lying Bust: 42 inches

Narrow roots, a little bit outer full, VFB, TONs of projection.
Seeing as I have no choice now but to live with this- what recommendations does anyone have for locking down movement AS MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE PLEASE?

I work teaching 12-18 year old boys. I cannot teach effectively if they can't stop staring at my breasts because they're wobbling/jiggling whenever I move. 

I need something to divert as much attention from my chest as possible. I literally want no movement whatsoever. Short of surgery that's the best option.

I have painful inverted psoriasis where my underwires go (thanks bust), so worry that a binder would exacerbate that. 

Does anyone know about binding or other lock-down options? I guess the FTM community may be my best source of help with this issue if anyone would be kind enough to help me. I'm happy being female sexually, but I absolutely hate hate hate my chest. I am becoming increasingly distressed with it as I age and it sags and becomes even more mobile.

Thanks so much in advance. Sorry for being so negative, I honestly just can't right now."

Ellie6718,asktransgender,Any transwomen that kept their penis? Lamenting my (kinda lack of actually :/) sexuality,"sorry about the format and stuff, I'm writing this at almost 2 am, and I'm pretty confused atm :(

It probably sounds weird, but I'm kinda upset that I have never had sex (or a *proper* orgasm...), and that if/when I start HRT (I'm still not 100% sure to be honest :(, but that feeling comes and goes).
So how has sex/masturbation changed after starting HRT? Cause honestly I usually masturbate (ugh, hate typing that...)almost once a day for stress relief (with terrible orgasms :/, which is probably another thing I'm lamenting about), and I'd rather not lose that outlet...

I really should see a therapist... Honestly I'm still not sure I'm definitely a girl (I mean I could just be very feminine, but IDK :( kinda confused still, this has been very sudden for me)"
Tgheidi,asktransgender,I sometimes wonder if any average looking cis woman would rather be a beautiful trans woman.... Please hear me out.,"This is just a weird thought that suddenly came to my mind. I don't intend to hurt anyone. I am not saying being trans is superior or inferior to being cis. nor that looks are more important than gender identity. But have you ever wondered what would cis women prefer to be if they could choose between being a average looking cis woman or a stunningly gorgeous trans woman? 

If some of the average looking cis girls, for whatever reason, say that they would rather be a beautiful trans woman, would this make you feel less sad about being transgender? I know I would feel better about being transgender if I knew cis girls could be envious of transgender women too."
Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Using the women's locker room as a trans woman without being a nervous wreck?,"So I've started using the women's locker room recently (after avoiding locker rooms altogether) because I've started swimming again and I'm not going to change on the pool deck or ride home wearing a dripping wet swimsuit. I should add that I get clocked as trans all the time and am not sure how much I pass even as a trans woman when I'm just wearing a gaff (which is how I tuck when I swim). I'm also lucky to live in an area where gender identity is legally protected, so I have no legal issues, and the pool is at a women's college (which I don't attend) open to the public. I've been showering on the pool deck (showering in the locker room feels unbelievably scary) and covering myself with a towel when I change (which I did even before transitioning, lol), so it's not like I'm in people's faces with my transness (though for safety and not out of guilt -- anyone having a problem with me is not my fault).

My problem is that I'm a nervous wreck in the locker room. Do any of you who use public facilities have either 1. any tips on things I should do other than be non-confrontational and to keep the gaff on or 2. ways I can think to keep from being a nervous wreck. The last time I was there I heard a girl coming in while I was changing (I really should have anticipated this) and I felt like {violence warning} Ted Cruz was about to billy club me on the head and throw me on a plane to Uganda (sorry if that offends anyone, but that was exactly what flashed before my eyes).

atgtoss,asktransgender,"Have pretty much stopped questioning, but I'm still feeling off.","Been dealing with the strong possibility that I am likely trans (mtf) for a couple months now. It's been an unconscious/unacknowledged thought for me since I was in grade school. 

I always assumed I was straight but simply had no sexual interest in the women I liked. Soon after puberty started I realized that it wasn't purely attraction, but more of an envy of their femaleness, their role and physical traits, clothing, social habits. Never had any interest in dating, for any reason, only minor crushes I never acted on. I was far closer to my female friends and felt it was easier being myself with them; I felt more genuine, more me. I always felt antisocial in my male peer groups, especially in sports, until I put on what I felt was an 'average' male persona, an adopted/false attitude to fit in. Just acting more 'typical male' just to get along with others well. To talk about which girls were hot or attractive and why. It felt/feels like a calculated mad-lib of sorts putting together sentences and conversations that would pass unnoticed. Nothing that would make me stand out in any way. Nothing that would make me seem anything but a 'normal guy' who did 'manly' sports and hobbies.

Upon graduation of high school and attending college, I eventually discovered the erotic side of the internet. I could never put myself in the role of the man in traditional or even unconventional pornography. The thought of penetrating a woman never even crossed my mind. I didn't realize I was always visualizing myself as the woman until later, after hearing my roommates boast of their sexual conquests and the thought of penetrating anyone disgusted me. I buried those thoughts for years, and more recently re-examined them and myself. The obvious conclusion seemed to be that I could be asexual or at least gray asexual with rare sexual desires.

I've since explored more, finding many descriptions for different sexual orientations, genders, etc. I don't think that I'm necessarily asexual, but rather I don't feel sexual attraction living as a male. I think I may be transgender and would be at least a lesbian, if not bi if I were born a woman. This has been a source of a lot of distress to me. Looking over the DSM5 guidelines for gender dysphoria didn't help much, only confirming and outlining many of my feelings towards myself. I've consciously felt a number of ways towards myself that fit the criteria.

I've discussed how I feel with a therapist, who aside from being very helpful and supportive has offered to put together a list of trusted gender therapists for me. I felt oddly better after talking about it, but it's faded somewhat. Aside from the fears of coming out and hoping for some degree of acceptance, I'm scared because I don't feel like my desires have anything to do with whether or not I will transition. It feels out of my control, like I need to, regardless of what I want. It feels like a deeper need than I've felt before. It feels like an inevitability. And I'm scared. I'm not sure what's next."
atranscouple,asktransgender,Achievement Unlocked: Unexpectedly gendered correctly at TSA,"Recently I took my first flight since I started transitioning (4mo ago HRT).  The horror stories I heard about the TSA made me super anxious about this; I'd been avoiding flying this whole time.

So, I opted to go in boy mode.  I wore some andro baggy clothes, put my hair up in a ponytail, removed my nail polish and kept my voice lower than normal.

I get to the security line at the airport and my heart is racing.  The id person looks at my passport (Which is from when I was 12, so it's younger and more feminine), and he glances back and forth at me several times.  Then hands me my passport without saying a word and looks at my face again in an expression that read 'I have my eye on you, don't try any shit here'.

I get to the scanner, and this is where I'm really worried because they have to select a gender on the scanner and if they select right, I will show up with an 'anomaly'.

I get in the scanner, and two security people (one woman, one man) are standing on the other side directing me to put my hands above my head.  The whole time I'm walking into the scanner, I can tell they're looking at my body to get a reading on my gender.    As I'm facing forward in the scanner and put my hands above my head, I can see in my peripheral the two arguing silently about what gender I am.  After about 7 seconds, the woman selects a button.  The scan finishes, and I see the woman had selected the 'female' button.  I totally freak out (but appear calm).  The man looks at me and says 'She will pat you down in a second'.  Turns out it was my right shin."

AprilCD,asktransgender,How to know when you've crossed the line from genderfluid into transgender??,"Hello! Long time lurker. AMAB. Hopefully this question isn't dumb. 

I'll try to give the details pertinent to my question.  I've been in the whole 'crossdressing' and genderfluid camp for a few years now. My wardrobe of dresses rivals my SO's, my makeup skills have improved, and I'm starting to grow out my hair so I can stop using wigs. Have yet to go out, at least in public, but social anxiety has been keeping me in check there. I have a supporting SO, and that's what matters, right?

When I was questioning a few weeks ago what I like about being each gender, I realized something: I don't actually *like* being male. I can look good as a guy, but there's nothing that I actually enjoy about being one. I wouldn't make an effort to be one. It's just... the default. The fallback position, the person I know society will accept. What I've been identifying as 'boy mode' is actually 'safe mode'. And if I didn't have god awful anxiety issues, I probably would have seen through this a lot sooner.

The second set of thoughts that have been coming up are how I hate that I feel I need to 'dress-up' to look like my desired gender. I've bought more casual women's clothes over the past year, but I feel awkward wearing them 'casually'. It feels wrong if I have even a bit of stubble or anything that's generally a male look about me. So when I do go through the effort to dress up as the other gender, I take pictures. Maybe I could make that girl exist a bit longer that way.

I can go through a list of other reasons I think I'm more in the transgender camp, but I'll be seeing a therapist in the coming weeks for that stuff. What I really wanted to ask was, are these genderfluid thoughts common? Is this a thing others have gone through? I think I've been subconsciously trying to bargain with myself from going the trans route, and understanding this now is making my brain explode."

For me it seems that them being able to pass the test should be a requirement, though possibly dealyed, if there is a physical reason.

But I am trying to be openminded.  I am Cis and have no trans friends that I know of.  I feel like there is something missing from the reason why they did this that I am not getting.  I want a different perspective.

throwaway2348921387,asktransgender,Weird spot–anyone want to interpret this?,"I have identified as agender for about 2 years. To me, gender is a social construct in which I don't feel comfortable participating in or identifying with. 

 I was assigned female at birth. Growing up, I disdained identifying with stereotypically feminine activities (wearing makeup and feminine clothing and etc.). My aversion to stereotypical feminine things hasn't always been consistent and I've chalked it up to internalized misogyny. I am not very comfortable with my body and feel most comfortable in simple, unisex style clothing. I have always wanted to present as completely androgynous and will always wear clothes that minimize or hide breasts. 

 A few times I've questioned whether I'm transgender and believe that I'm probably not. I do, however, feel most comfortable physically presenting as ""male.""  

I have dressed as males in costumes several times and when doing so, been obsessed with passing as a male.  Today I went to a party wearing sporting fake stubble and beard. I'd never done so before but it felt like the most physically comfortable version of myself, like I had finally presented a form that was ""true to me."" I thought that if I could look like this everyday, I would feel more comfortable. It is hard to explain. Is this just a strong interest in presenting as male or crossdressing? I don't think I possess a stereotypical male personality but then again, always feel out of place when participating in stereotypical ""female talk"" about relationships (many of my female friends have this interest; I do not). I feel confused at this point and weird. Any thoughts?

HakaweBrave,asktransgender,Trans in New Mexico?,"Hi there! I am a 27 year old transfeminine person, AMAB, pre-everything. Well, pre-transition would probably be more accurate. The truth is, I have been out to myself for about 10 years, and out to many people in my life for about 7. In general, life is pretty good, right now. I have a wonderful SO, who is supportive, if a bit new to identity politics in general. Plus, I feel that either my dysphoria has grown too great or various personal pressures have decreased to the point where I am ready for transition. Honestly, this is fantastic. I am a little trepidatious, but it's a huge relief-- and it's about time. 

However, I am about to move across the country to the Santa Fe, NM area. I am ready, financially. I have pinned down absolutely no transition resources in the area, though. I may be able to connect with my current gender therapist with the magic of the internet. I would like to pin down an endo in the area, though. Recommendations for things like laser clinics and even friendly thrift stores would be lovely, as well. Community is always something wonderful to have, as well. So, any one looking for new friends is welcome to inbox me, as well.

YharnamSeeker,asktransgender,I need advice on making the call,"So im new here, actually im new to reddit all together. Even after using the internet for so long, somehow Ive never felt the need to post here till today because I have a big question, and I need some serious opinion.

Anyway story goes im 25 male, unfortunately. For years Ive struggled with the issues of gender dysphoria which only got worse over the years. I had enough troubles through my teenage life to never even have to time to consider my own well being. It was really just survival back then but now years later I realized how much I should have tried to transition back then but with so many problems it probably wouldn't have worked out for me.

Fast forward years later and for the longest time I gave up on the idea of transitioning. My life is hard enough I don't have a support network in place. Family whilst accepting to a level (they still have no idea im trans as I have kept it my deepest secret from everyone) they are also not totally accepting like I can tell they will be both shocked, disappointed and ashamed even if they never admit it they're not bad people just can be self absorbed sometimes. I can't force them to be totally accepting but seeing them ashamed would really hurt me family means a lot and as the oldest of the family they always put their hopes on me so to speak. I had to play the responsible man from an early age especially as it was my siblings that got to do the acting out stage which I had to skip to become responsible and give up the things I wanted for the family's sake again this wasn't specifically expressed more feelings of commitment I picked up from them.

Anyway as I said I can't rely on them to understand or fully support me and currently I don't have any friends, the only friends I do see once a blue moon I can tell will probably just drop me all together after I tell them they don't want any friend they consider complicated.

I don't particularly live in a great area either it can be pretty rough and I don't drive so im using public transport to get around and the prospect of me dealing with a transition alone and going out in public dealing with all this new stuff by myself and having strangers potentially get violent or aggressive. It scares me im used to being invisible and Ive only ever lived one way I have nobody to guide me or help me out with things like hair, shopping for clothing. I don't want to get thrown out of the clothing section or have to face the dreaded public bathroom glares by myself. Im just not that strong a person which is why I just gave up some years ago but living as I am is slowly killing me. I have no drive, motivation or hope for a future I simply don't want to live this future, this life. I don't eat my family gets worried because im becoming all skin and bones thats getting worse and worse, I sleep all the time I have no purpose or life. It's a pit for me and a potential collapse of what little I do have alternative.

I just don't know what to do if things were simple it wouldn't even be a question I would transition but everything is so complicated and I feel lost, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any time I think I might have the courage to go forward I get into an argument with my folks over nothing and they declare me a loser, failure, can't do anything for myself, no job, no relationship ect just made to feel like even worse nothing than already do.

I know what I want to do but I honestly objectively thinking on it from a cold rational standpoint can't see me surviving it. I don't have the strength to go and fight alone. I already have a history of depression, anxiety, anorexia it just feels like its stacked against me.

Sorry for being a downer in my first post but I need help and I got nobody to turn to."

Why does everyone practically hate us for existing? Why are they so against us being happy? Why do they push for us to ""accept"" our biological sex because that's ""who we really are""?

I'm sick of living in this terrible world, I hate the fact I even have to worry that our rights to transition will be taken away... I hate what this world has become. 

Some days I just feel like dying and leaving this all behind, I just want to be at peace because I obviously can never be at peace in life because I always have to be scared of transphobic people and I always have to be scared of people laughing and pointing at me if they detect me and I have to live with the sad truth of my godforsaken body...those people say transition causes us to be suicidal but they are the true cause they make me feel hopeless they make me feel like dying they make me feel like ending my life...

Sorry for yet another rant but I need to get this off my chest... I just can't stand living this way any longer I just want someone to put me out of my misery, I just want to live in a world where I can be myself and be accepted. But this world obviously isn't the place for me... 

I sometimes think maybe I shouldn't transition and that I should just live my life as a cold sad empty shell of a person just to survive and never do a thing with my pitiful life, because it's worthless in a world like this, it's worthless to be trans because the truth hurts... they're right my body being the way it is does hurt, the fact I was born this way hurts, but it's not just a small inconvenience the truth stabs me right through the chest and leaves me lifeless... that's the best way to explain it.

Mericarol,asktransgender,[NSFW] Conditioned arousal and doubt question.,"NSFW (Sorry if I'm overstating NSFW, new user and I don't want to be a creep.)

I'll preface this by saying that it all kind of hit me like a truck about a week and a half ago. Realizing I'm mtf and reliving tons of weird memories I kept that I thought were meaningless but were like a run of ""classic hits"" of being trans. For years I had gotten pretty good at killing the notion I was trans.

One of the mechanisms I kind of latched onto again was the trite ""It is just a kink"" thing. In retrospect I kind of realize that it was less of a kink and more of the only way I could pleasure myself was completely disassociating myself from my body and thinking of myself as a woman. But because I did this in some formative years I'm paranoid. When I get to the point where I can get clothes and dress to feel good about my body at all that I might feel ""too"" good. Like I've associated the fabrics and textures with a sense of arousal. I even fell in the hole of ""sissy"" and captions porn.

I already hated getting boners normally and now that I've already destroyed my doomed brain with this association I'm starting to doubt my feelings of being trans already even though it feels like the only light in my life that could make me not hate everything about myself. For the first time ever I have a sense of hope and self-ownership for my physicality. I'm worried this is all in contention because I self sabotaged by fetishizing myself.

Is this a common problem? Would this just be untrained via exposure once I can finally dress regularly, even just in private? Am I overthinking this? Sorry if I ran on, I'm kind of still rattled and distressed from this whole epiphany chain."

The first thing I noticed was the calmness that many people report. I  am still stressed out by work, but I have less tension and aggression in my body. Next, I started losing my morning erection in the morning and starting last week sex was much harder to achieve as I was not able to easily maintain my erection, but my orgasm was much more intense and I only had clear liquid ejaculate rather meekly (tmi).

More interestingly, my breasts have been very sensitive. My areolas have expanded a lot and my nipple  went from having very small tips to hard nodules. Most impressively this week I have started to have a slight overhang to my boobs and there is definitely noticeable fat redistribution.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I Bought A Dress by Myself!,"So last week I was standing outside of Burlington Coates Factory, nervously, afraid of going in.  I stood outside for nearly forty minutes, pretending to look at my cell phone.  Eventually, I decided that if I didn't go in then, I never would.  

I walked inside and I immediately saw the dresses.  I went past them and went towards the men's coats.  I pretended to be looking at them, but I was really just looking at the dresses.  I was subconscious of every person in the building, I couldn't stop thinking about what they would do after I picked up a dress.

I decided that I wasn't going to leave empty handed, so I cautiously walked towards the dresses.  The moment I got there, I looked around me to see if anyone was watching me.  No one was, so I scanned the dresses, and looked for one that looked like it might fit.

I snagged it and waited in line at the counter.  There were two people at the counter, but when I got there the lady looked at my dress and left.  When I got to the other woman, she gave me a strange look as I put down the dress.

I said, ""I know that may seem strange.  But it's for a Halloween Party.  I'm going as a girl.""

She smiled and I bought the dress.

That's the story of how I bought my first dress.  And it feels awesome!  In fact, after that I called my trans friend (f2m) and he invited me to go dress shopping with him.  So, a few days later, we went downtown and bought like five dresses with makeup and eyeliner.  I had never been shopping before, and I honestly had no idea of what I was doing, but he explained everything to me.  He was honestly the nicest person I have ever met.

He even at one point called me ""she""  Can you believe that!?  He even used a female pronoun!  It felt amazing.   And it was honestly the most wonderful time that I ever think that I have had with any friend.  It was an unforgettable experience.

I guess the reason why I'm posting this is to urge people on here to go out of their comfort zone.  Had I stayed inside my bubble and not stepped out of it, then these amazing experiences wouldn't have happened.  I guess I'm just encouraging other transgender people on here to do the same.

Mainly it's because I can always go back to HRT, but I can't go back to my original male state after the 6 month period (possibly becoming sterile and permanent breast development).  It's a little maddening, because I've basically walked right up to the door and I was just about to turn the nob and get started with the physical changes.  I feel like I need to do this though, and in a way test myself for what I really want to do.

My main question:  If I decide to turn around and immediately go back on HRT, will I lose much progress or will I simply have to start all over with another 6 months for major changes to take place?  I'm being weened off of estrogen right now as a very low dose.  It's been almost a month, and after that I'll be completely off of any meds.  

I think that it will take about 3 months for me to fully gain normal male hormone levels again.  This was suppose to be for fertility purposes and libido, but now I'm feeling like there is no way I can deal with 3 months in going toward the wrong direction.  I'm feeling terrible and I'm really struggling to function as a person, both at home and out in public."

I seem to be having ""phantom breast"" sensations recently due to this, and having breasts is a strong focus of my fantasies.

I'm just a little confused and not sure what to do if he does contact me. We had a decent friendship before I started transitioning, but I haven't actually seen him since. Should I try to explain to him that this is who I am now and ask him to respect who I am? Or should I just tell him to leave me alone and never bother me again?"

Anyway, I've subsequently realised that my face is quite asymmetric. One brow flops over my eye more than the other, my nose is a bit wonky as is my chin. Due to my features I suspect FFS would be on the cards one day, and was wondering - do people use FFS as a way to correct things as well as feminise? Does it increase costs or is it a case of you're on the table anyway...

Sorry if this isn't amazingly inclusive - I do genuinely wonder though, is there such a thing as FMS, or have trans men had the experience where only once in tune with their gender that there actually 'see' their face. Or maybe I'm now just viewing my face through an overly critical dysphoric lens and I don't look anywhere near as wonkey as I think I do..."
Questioning-Alt,asktransgender,I wrote up a coming-out letter to my parents in case I need it. I really want to hear your thoughts. All names mentioned are replaced with brackets.,"Dear Mom and Dad,

I don’t know if you are ever going to read this letter. Maybe you’ll find out before you do.  However, I’m going to do it anyway. It has been on my mind constantly, and I need to get it out somehow.

Since  August, I’ve been questioning my gender identity. It all started after I started crossdressing (I stopped soon after that after realizing wearing other people’s clothes is pretty rude and kinda gross), which at the time, I thought was some kind of weird hobby. I felt like I was comfortable in my body, and didn’t want to be a girl full-time. Eventually, I began to reconsider this.

I’d never really thought I was trans before then. Sure, I briefly thought about the idea from time to time when thinking about my sexual identity, but I never considered it to be a big possibility. Eventually, on the 27th of August, I talked to [transguy friend] on Facebook about it. If anyone would know a thing or two about this, it would be him. This was at a point where I thought I was probably just a typical run-of-the-mill crossdresser, but the way [transguy friend] said that he was excited to see a “potential tiny transgirl” made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside.

After that first chat, I made another reddit account and talked about my experiences on /r/asktransgender. This would be the first of many posts there. I was also going on dress up games online and creating a girl version of myself, and it felt satisfying. By god, was it satisfying. Eventually, I came out to [agender friend] , who in turn informed a couple of our friends that I was questioning, and also [cisguy friend], who said he also had this idea in 8th grade, but it eventually dissipated. He said that he willed it away, so maybe it was repression, but I don’t know. I am not him.

Since then, these feelings have gotten stronger. I constantly have thought about taking hormones and transitioning. I’ve been anxiously awaiting the day when I could talk to [my neurologist] about this, which is why I’ve been asking. I’ve been hoping that Dad doesn’t remember briefly seeing me root through mom’s bra drawer. I don’t know how to feel honestly.

You know, I’m kind of surprised that I didn’t have these thoughts sooner. When I was younger, I remember being fascinated by the idea of shapeshifting. When I first discovered what being transgender even was, I remember watching so many videos on it, oddly transfixed on them. Maybe I always sort of knew, just subconsciously, if that makes sense at all.

Long story short, I want you to be the loving and supporting parents I know you are. It’s okay to feel a little doubt or caution, because frankly, I feel that too. The road ahead is long and winding, and can be confusing without a good guide or two. I hope that when the time comes, I shall understand who I am. 

Your son (?)

transthrowaway00000,asktransgender,Another PSA: PLEASE be careful if you wear hair extensions,"So I'm one of those people who's heard the whole ""hair extensions aren't bad for you"" thing several times over and so I went and I got some. I don't disagree with what people say and in fact I used to wear extensions all the time. Every day actually. Which is what turned out to be the problem.

A few months ago I started noticing my hair falling out a ton when I washed my hair. A bunch more would fall out when I took my hair down or unclipped my extensions. At first it never even crossed my mind that it could've been my extensions. I happened to be looking at more facts about extensions when I encountered tension alopecia.

Essentially it's going bald from things pulling on your hair. So not just extensions but super tight braids, buns, and up-dos also contribute. 

I'm fortunate because I think I was able to catch it before I PERMANENTLY damaged my hair follicles and I lost the ability to grow hair in those areas. However like I said, it's been months and I'm only now STARTING to see an improvement. Right now all the places with thinned out hair only have little fine baby hairs and I'm sure it'll take at least a year to even get decent growth. 

So please be careful. Save yourself the trouble. Not saying you can't wear extensions, but PLEASE DO NOT wear them everyday. Give your hair a break. Even if you get them professionally done, the mere weight pulling on your hair follicles can lead to permanent damage. Also change up how you put your hair up or in a bun (yes bring back the side pony!). Also try to avoid other sources of pulling such as when using heating tools (especially curling -- lots of people like to pull really tight) or when you dry with a towel (which you really shouldn't do anyways) or even when brushing hair. 

I know it's not always easy taking care of hair but I think in the long run it's worth it. Nothing given, nothing gained right? Also I know it can feel unsightly, dysphoric, or even downright frustrating to go a day without extensions, but there are other ways to look fantastic without them. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text (and all the caps) and if I sounded preach-y. I don't mean to, trust me, hair care and self-care is a work in progress for me too, I'm not perfect. Have an awesome week and please know that you are beautiful/handsome and amazing. I'm not ""just"" saying that. I know it to be true. "

Rose_Hawk,asktransgender,Hair and Hormones,"Hello, so little bit of context to this.

Then puberty hit, the swine, and it when this muddy browny blonde but the roots and some parts of my fringe, bangs for you US folk, are still blonde.

So my question is, is that due to testosterone? Because in theory if that is true when I, someday when the NHS finally tells me I can, start HRT would it revert over time back to blonde or go lighter?  If it does either blonde or redhead please :3

Anyone else have this same thing with their hair? I find it interesting but then again I am rather odd as you can probably tell by how to type :)"
prettykatrina,asktransgender,Help with an Itchy Nipple - MTF,"So this one is kind of personal, and I'm not trying to wig anyone out, just looking for some advice.

I'm 35 AMAB - MTF - and I've been on HRT since mid August.  I'm not out at work, though I for Apple so I'm not horribly worried about coming out and already have to several co-workers.  Just not ready to embrace it and go full time yet.

So, some details: About a month ago I noticed more nipple sensitivity, and this month I've noticed some additional fat growth, not much, but I can really tell when I lean forward.
I was already overweight, though I've been losing a lot this year, but is it isn't horribly noticeable or interfering with boymode (I'm doing more of that myself by wearing a little makeup every day.  Again, don't really care if it gets sort of obvious.

I don't really fit a sports bra very well yet, especially since it seems like I'd need like a 42A which isn't very standard.  Plus I'm not sure that'd help, just wanted to sort of say I've thought about that already.

bacon_is_good_,asktransgender,Name change questions?,"Hey so, I'm graduating soon and really don't want my diploma to have my birth name. 

So I'm likely getting my name changed soon! But here's a question...

I still live at home and my parents are really not cool with this whole thing. That's fine, but I can't deal with the name anymore. 

For things like my parents' life insurance and wills they'd never change the name from my old one to my new one, but since it's a legal change and I'd have the documentation, would I still be their beneficiary legally? (also since things like life insurance also have gender markers for beneficiaries, would it matter if I get my legal gender marker changed?)

Things like health insurance and such I assume I do have to change, or is it possible I don't have to?

lyaa55,asktransgender,Almost 2 months into HRT. Reservations resurfacing,"I've been really struggling the last week or so.  I've been on HRT about 2 months.  The immediate effects of HRT directly have felt unambiguously good-- most particularly, the big insuppressible smile I get every time I let an estrogen pill dissolve under my tongue.  Similarly, the social effects of telling select friends have been unambiguously good.  Hanging with girls as a girl has totally reinvigorated my fading interest in having a social life.

Yet I have these unshakable fears than I'm not doing the right thing.  I worry: I'll look down in 2 years and realize I didn't want breasts after all.  I worry I'll be making so many aspects of my life so much more difficult for something that maybe I don't even really need to do.  I worry that I'm confusing a sex thing (like being attracted to gay woman or ""subby-side"" bdsm interests) with gender issues.  Although it's easy to imagine how these are related to my trans feels in ways that certainly don't delegitimize them.

The reasons I can put my finger on for having these persistent doubts are:
1) Fear of social reception and discrimination.  Internalized sexism and transmisogyny
2) ""Unconventional"" and/or weak trans narrative
3) Lack of history of furtive crossdressing

To clarify 2 &amp; 3,
I went out full femme pretty regularly from ages 16-26 (having started HRT at 26).  But I always wore full femme to parties where it could be a costume or drag, never alone in my room.
I also kind of ""crossdress"" everyday, in subtle and unsubtle ways.  My collared shirt hangs off my shoulder.  I cut my shorts high enough that the pockets show.  I try to wear sweaters or jackets longer than my shorts to feel more femme.  I wear loud women's tights and subtly femme outfits regularly.  etc etc.

When I scrounge my personal history, there is plenty of ""i wanted to be a girl.""  But there is very little ""I hope and pray everyday to be a girl.""

I do know that I had dysphoria; it was subtle for me but both physical and social.  I know that even with the host of pressing anxieties that deciding to transition has introduced (including this current wave of self-doubt) I am currently a much happier, less anxious, more energetic, and more hopeful person than I was before starting hrt.

This anxiety may have been caused today by talking to a professor about my post-school plans.  I haven't come out as trans at school and in our conversation we were considering intense careers for me that probably aren't particularly trans-friendly.  So maybe this derailed the trans woman future I had been imagining and caused all this anxiety.  It may still make sense to put HRT on hold, put off any permanent effects, and resolve my questioning.  On the other hand, I've tried to put HRT on hold 2 other times and felt my debilitating anxiety and depression return, so I quickly resumed. (So why am I still having reservations?)

TL;DR
I'm about 2 months on hormones.  I'm having reservations.  What I'm really interested in is: If you had reservations about transitioning or particular aspects of transitioning, how were these definitively resolved for you?  What can I do to reassure myself-- or to help me realize that I jumped into something massive that may not be right for me?

The hormonal / social aspects seem much more important to me than the presentation aspect, which seems weird.  That may be because I've been regularly wearing subtly or overtly femme clothing in public for years and so am in no rush to change my appearance.  (I related to Julia serrano's account of her transition, where she wore the same t shirt and jeans as both a guy and a girl.  I'll wear the same flannel shirts and cut off shorts, and expand rather than substitute.)"
fierce_fem-uhnist-,asktransgender,Wife of trans woman having anxiety about her sexuality changing once she starts HRT :/,"Hello all! I'm a 33 year old AFAB genderfluid femme married to an amazing trans woman; we've been partnered for almost 4 years and have been married for a little over a month now. My wife identified as genderfluid and ""cross dressed"" when we first began dating, but was open and honest from the beginning of our relationship that she thought she might be happier living as a woman ""full time."" As a queer person who has dated both cis and trans women as well as non-binary folks, I was supportive of this possibility from the beginning, but my wife decided to finish school and get a good job first. After doing that (it took a few years), she came out as transgender at the beginning of this year and has been living as a woman since then. We've had a really positive experience during this whole process-both of our families (mostly hers-ALL of hers has been great, much of mine's been good) have been supportive, both of our jobs also have been (I'm a therapist, she's an engineer, both companies are awesome), and all of our friends have been wonderful (not unexpected, since we were both heavily LGBTQ-community involved before the transition). Heck, even people in general have been great. She's just filed for her legal name change, and will likely have both her name and gender marker changed by the end of November :).

Why am I anxious, then? Well, my wife has not yet started HRT-although she's been living as female for over 6 months, she did not connect with an appropriate doctor until this summer, and the process took longer than we thought it would. So, she's actually beginning HRT today-we're going to the doctor for the appointment tonight. I'm, frankly, terrified, because I've heard some horror stories about peoples' sexuality changing when they go on HRT-specifically about some trans women only liking men and leaving their female/femme partners who have helped them through their transitions :/. I love my wife immensely, and the thought of losing her in this way terrifies me; this is pretty much the only anxiety I've had regarding her transition. I have dated other trans women before, as I mentioned, but only those who had already started HRT. We're non-monogamous (have been since the beginning of our relationship, as we both have been our entire adult lives/consider this our relationship orientation), but don't connect with others outside of our relationship too often and, when we do, interact with them together; my wife identifies as queer, but she does not generally find men attractive (leans about 90% toward femme/female-presenting individuals) and usually wants to connect with other trans women when she does want to sleep with anyone else (because she ""likes penises but doesn't like men""). I'm scared she's going to start veering toward the male side, wanting to sleep with men more and more (I'm a little scared of the way men might treat her, frankly), and (my biggest fear) might end up leaving me for a romantic relationship with a man. She assures me that this won't happen, because ""men are yucky,"" and I understand that my fear is pretty irrational, because we're crazy in love and feel we're soulmates (we got married on the same day we had planned pre-transition because we're each others' persons and gender doesn't change that)-I can't imagine my life without her...but still, scary stories = anxiety. My mother has Borderline Personality Disorder and we've had a really push-pull relationship throughout my life, with her ""rejecting"" me every time she's felt I wasn't ""the ideal daughter"" then acting a few weeks later like nothing happened, so I have some fears of abandonment that tend to come out during times filled with change :/.

So, those of you who are transitioning/have transitioned and have been on HRT for at least a few months: did you see a change in your sexual orientation at all? In your sex drive? (We have an amazing and active sex life, and, although I'd miss it, I would not mind if it lessened as long as my wife and I still have each other). And, most importantly, did any of you leave a long-term partner/spouse because you stopped being attracted to them? Please, I'd love to hear your stories and perspectives so I can ease my anxious mind. I am so happy for my wife and am really enjoying the positive changes in her life because of the transition (and find her even more attractive now than I used to-she's being herself, so she practically glows!)-so I don't want to be madly in love and left high and dry by the only person I've ever wanted to spend my life with :/. It is physically painful to think of this happening :(. Regardless of what you write, thank you for your perspectives and time."

Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,"Trans women: What do you think when someone tells you you're ""gorgeous?"" How do you react?","Background: I went out recently in a hyper-androgenous costume I threw together at the last minute. (As a visibly trans woman, I started to get nervous that my original idea would get me misgendered.) I used parts of a costume from an old La Scala opera production of MacBeth with some makeup that drew some inspiration from Classic Lolita style. The idea was to be like a nutcracker whose gender I remember arguing with my sister about as a kid, though no one was able to guess correctly -- should have been less subtle with the doll elements of my makeup.

Anyway, quite a few people came up to me to admire my costume, and that was quite fun. But one person, who I've been in several trans spaces with but never talked to before, came up to me to tell me that I looked gorgeous and had great hair. I thanked them and told them how much it meant to me (and joked that the hair was all due to hormones). It got me thinking, however, about being called gorgeous because I've never been praised that way in public before (though it's not entirely foreign to me from online).

In my experience ""gorgeous"" has the subtext of being sexually desireable, but am I perhaps being paranoid with that feeling of internal discomfort? (I should add that I'm still working with a therapist through some things from my past that make me feel uncomfortable with being seen as sexually available in public.)

What do other people here think the message is when they are called ""gorgeous?"" How do you react, especially if you want to keep things coy?

Sorry if this is all girl 101 stuff, but I haven't had to deal much with this sort of experience IRL, and most of that up to now has revolved around worrying about being clocked."

cinnamon_anxiety,asktransgender,Long-term (6+ months) FFS swelling questions.,"**I know this post is long, so please only respond to or read as much as you like.** I'm happy with whatever!

**Quick / general questions:**

* Did you notice your swelling going up *and* down well-past the 6-month point? Were some parts of your face worse about this than others?

* Did you feel that the majority of your swelling was gone at 6 months, or did it take much longer for ""most"" to go away?

* Is there anything you know of that might interfere with swelling reduction in the long-term (e.g. medications, smoking, sleep habits, foods, etc.)? Did any adjustments you made after several months seem to speed up the process for you?

**More specific questions:**

~ *My forehead swells up and down - noticeably - on a daily basis.*

I find it odd that this is something that changes so much, so frequently. It is very easy to confirm just how much swelling there is by touch. On very rare occasions, my forehead can swell enough to ache a little, and the swelling is usually much better when I get up from bed. Is this normal? Will it, eventually, settle into its low point at all times?

~ *The tip of my nose seems very stubborn.*

I think the tip of my nose remains very swollen and I can feel a hard lump on the inside (which supposedly indicates swelling?). I've read from some open rhinoplasty patients that massive changes can be seen from month 10, all the way up to month 18 for people with thick nasal skin (such as myself). Has anyone had an experience like this?

~ *My jaw bone is a bit bumpy.*

My jaw ridge feels a little rough and bumpy when I touch along it. Is this a swelling effect, and if not, does FFS not typically leave a smooth jaw bone once all has settled?


I look forward to any replies! Thanks!"
HammersAndBells,asktransgender,Have you ever had to endure trans sensitivity training before coming out?,"I'm in the early stages of transition.  I teach in a public high school; no one here knows that I'm transgender.

This year we admitted our first openly trans student so the administration organized a series of training sessions related to transgender issues.

It's hard to describe how emotionally exhausting it is to be in the closet while sitting through these sessions. There is a lot of disgusting bigotry I've overheard coming from the mouths of fellow teachers. If it was directed toward any other group they would be reprimanded, but I guess it's still open season on trans people. 

It's also unsettling to have admittedly well intentioned cis-gendered people try teach you about your own gender dysphoria and getting it wrong.

Wickiot,asktransgender,Seeking clarification (long?),"Hi!

I was wondering if I could maybe get some feedback, food for thoughts here about something I can never really settle with.

I'm not saying I *have to* identify, but I feel it would help if I could at least find some hint of identity to relate to, if it makes sense.

I've been reflecting on this for years, on and off, at some moments I'd just shove it back deep and auto-cruise through life, while at other times I need to face it and wrestle intellectually with it.

A while back I also went to the local LGBTQ centers, to find some support, have a place to talk, but that didn't turn as well as I expected, I won't get into details tho since it's not really the point. But from there, I found I didn't really relate to queer or agender or bigender, I don't think it's exactly fluid or lacking any or both, I mean if I could, I'd probably make a shift towards my preferences, but I'm still alright somewhere in between.



I've never felt like I really identified with my birth sex (male), but at the same time, I've never felt a real dysphoria (I think). I do wish I had a more androgynous appearance, especially when I feel more feminine, because then I want to fit in my clothes better. At the same time, while I may be very curious about what it's like to be a woman when it comes to ""plumbing"", I'm kind of ok with my own, it's not always comfortable, but I don't have an urge to undergo surgery, in fact I'm quite reluctant. So I sort feel like I would be a fraud trying to identify as trans, because as though I considered transitioning when I was much younger, now I found I can do a lot of things to express my feminine side that do help me feel much better about myself.

Overall, I sort of see myself as a mixture of both, like I had both a man and a woman in me, but not conflicting with each other, instead, they both need some level of attention to remain balanced.



I think I may have digressed a bit, sorry about that, what I'm trying to say, is that I can't really find where I ""belong"" so to speak and it makes it quite awkward if not embarassing, when I get asked by other people, besides saying ""it's complicated"" which often turns some people down at the idea there's a long convoluted explanation coming, which there can be... and it also makes it uneasy taking part in communities when I don't really know if I fit in or not.


Anyway, I should probably wrap this up before it gets even more confusing than it is, so feel free to drop a comment or message if something isn't clear, I'm looking forward to read some inputs to think about."
Wickiot,asktransgender,Shall we talk about fat?,"I still can't really work the kink of fat redistribution.

I'm 6""1 and 150lbs. I have a little cushion on the belly and love handles. I don't know if there's such a thing, but I'd say it's mostly old fat that I got in my early-mid twenties and it's pretty much been there since.

HRT changes the way the body stores fat, and incidently, where it's looking for fat to burn when needed, as I understood. So I assume that the only way I can expect my shape to change, is if I really drain as much fat as possible, then let the new one settle where it tends to go.

I know losing and gaining fat can't be targetted, but if I got it right, it sounds like if I do nothing and don't gain weight, my shape won't change and if I gain weight, it'll be on the hips and ass, then belly.

Am I understanding it correctly, or is there some subtleties I missed?"
throwaway4fun200,asktransgender,Looking for advice from other MTF girls who were extremely hairy pre-transition.,"I'm MTF, still pre everything at this point. Out to family and a few friends. I just moved and can't find a therapist here until me new insurance kicks in, so I'm turning to the ladies of /r/asktransgender for advice here!

In my currently male body, I'm super hairy. I'm about 75% covered in dark thick hair. Last week I shaved my chest and legs for the third time this year, but it's such a pain to maintain. My hair grows fast, and even a good shave only lasts a couple of days before their is a significant amount of stubble. Also, there are a lot of parts of my body that I have a difficult time reaching. My back is extremely difficult for me to shave by myself, for example.

I've tried Nair and it burned the shit out of my skin. I've thought about trying other types of depilatory cremes, but I don't want to burn myself again. 

I've thought about waxing, but I'm not sure about that because I'm scared I'd end up like Steve Carrel in 40 Year Old Virgin. Plus, I'm not sure how long it lasts. If I have to go in frequently, that'll be expensive, and doing it myself will be tough because I'm sure getting my back covered will be difficult as well. 

I'm extremely far from being able to go in for laser hair removal or electrolysis, though those are the eventual goal.

I feel so much better about myself when I shave. I hate being as hairy as I am. It's just soooooo much work to maintain.

Thanks in advance ladies!"

gossfunkel,asktransgender,How do I pluck my eyebrows without it messing with guy mode?,"Hey folks, I'm a trans girl fairly new to trying to pass in public, and after some (very determined) questioning, I've heard that my eyebrows are one of the things that make me struggle to pass.

I'm aware I have quite bushy eyebrows naturally- I've actually taken to shaving them to subtly reshape them and take the worst of the caterpillars away, but they're now just light male eyebrows, and are quite obvious. I really wanna pluck them (and have done since before I knew they were a major obstacle to me passing, but this has brought it forward a lot in my priorities)- but I have a slight issue.

Even though I plan on coming out to most everyone in my life soon (ideally, on coming out day next week), I'm not comfortable coming out at work (the usual stuff, not sure who's bigoted and I don't want that affecting my already strained income, and my social anxiety is bad enough without trans awkwardness kicking in), so I still need to retain guy mode without anything too suspect.

Thusly, how do I pluck my eyebrows without it being too obvious? Are there gender-neutral eyebrow shapes? Are there any tricks to masculinising my eyebrows when in guy mode? What should I do??? :O

Thanks for any and all responses in advance :)"

zauraz,asktransgender,"I lost the ""feeling""?","Heya. Sorta asked this before I think but I can't double check that now.

Several months ago I came to the realization that I might be trans. This developed and I could not stop thinking about the possibility. Every second of every day was sorta spent think about this and attempting to rationalize it.

All on the weak idea that I wanted to be a girl.

Around the age of 11 I started to become jealous of the female body. finding my own body horrible and disgusting I wanted a body that I could like for myself. Generally I have had some discomfort about my body and genitalia but weak.

I started having dreams in which I was a girl. Waking up from them was horrible, I did not want reality to be true. I also started dressing as fem in private by ""borrowing"" clothes and fantasized a lot about being turned into a girl etc. Like ""what if I woke up as a girl tomorrow?"". When I first started thinking about this it coincided with the beginning of my sexuality.

At first I just saw myself as a crossdresser and that my desires were some weird sexual thing. I put very little thought into it except once when I thought of telling my mom that ""I wanted to be a girl"". 

The change came when I met one of my closest friends. He came out as gender fluid which made me tell her that I was a ""transvestite"" and liked wearing fem clothes. I did however feel that this definition was lacking as I genuinely wanted to have a female body and not just dress the part.

In the end this lead me to find out about transgender. The first definition however crushed my hopes. I read that you ""had to know from a young age"". I now know this is false but back then it broke me.

Towards the end of 2015 I revisited the idea of being trans. I had become obsessed with genderbending and I still kept fantazising about becoming a girl. I realized that the ""standard narrative"" was bullshit etc. I found hope and belief in something since a long time. I did quizzes and kept ending back up with results like ""crossdresser"" etc but that just made me mad. Crossdressing does not feel like it is what I want. I came out weaks later to friends and mom and started a long process which is now bringing me towards gender therapy.

However first these latest days I have managed to deal with my stress and racing thoughts and letting them go. Now I realize that something is missing. My desire is tbh gone. There is nothing, I am empty inside. I never felt specifically ""male"" or ""female"" but I always imagined my inner self as feminine. But now I don't really have a desire for a female body at all. My weak dysphoria is barely there and I am sorta even not accepting but am able to live with my male body. The thought of not being trans makes me feel sad and bad but still at the same time I lack any feelings that truly tells me that I am. I am confused and lost right now and wish for advice..

-----------

Tl;dr Used to have desire for female body. Now after stress is relieved there is only emptiness and I sorta lack the desire. Lost and confused. any ideas?"

I just want a bare minimum, so I don't feel like I'm missing a chunk of me. Can I expect more? I kinda feel like the growth has stopped, and a lot of sources seem to say 18 months is about it…

ts_curious,asktransgender,"For those that struggled to take the leap from thinking you might be trans to accepting it, how did you get there?","So, basically I am one of those that are struggling with the question whether I am trans or not, and was just wondering about those that struggled to come to accept that you were transgender, how did you come to that conclusion so to speak. Was there any exercise or thoughts that you had that helped you realize and accept it?

I have shared a bit of my story before, but here is a little recap (sorry, this might be a bit long).

Basically, in february I started to question wether I might be trans or not. I have been crossdressing since I was 6, and have struggled with addiction to transexual porn for the last 18 years, imagining myself as the woman in those scenes. My wife found out that I was struggling, and she had a serious panic attack (she suffers from anxiety, depression and borderline personality disorder)because she was afraid of loosing me, which kind of led me to think that I was questioning because I was stressed and stuff, and that it was still just crossdressing, or a fetish. Around that time I also got a referral to a psychologist, but the waiting list was very long, and I had my first session with him 2 weeks ago. At the same time my family got to know, and I was told that they love me no matter what.
Now, after the panic attack my wife had, and the retreat that I did I have been questioning a lot, and I know that a lot of people do this, and I am yet to read about anyone who struggled so much, and still confirmed that they were just cis men with a very strong fetish.
I do not feel any strong feelings towards my male role, and I do love wear dresses and heels when I have the chance. I have been wondering if it is dysphoria I have felt, and here is basically some of the things I have felt or thought or experienced on and off over the last few months.

Nervousness

Built up tension in my body

Frequent deep sighing to release tension

Sore &amp; tense neck muscles

Feeling low

Feeling numb

Grumpy

Nauseous

Depressed

Feeling like a robot

Periods of low motivation

Trying to lock down my emotions

Feeling envious of girls and what they get to wear

Feeing envious of MTF girls that have transitioned and that are living life as their authentic self

Looking for options to crossdress

Love the feeling of being tucked, as well as seeing my crotch being flat

I have also saved some links to clothing stores in case I get diagnosed as transgender, just to be prepared, and often catch myself thinking of myself in the future as a woman. I also decided to buy myself a pair of high heel pumps because I feel been feeling an urge and longing to wear those since forever, and my wife has small feet, so I never get to try on hers....

So these symptoms or experiences I guess kind of leads me towards the idea that I am transgender and that I am experiencing dysphoria, but I am still struggling to fully accept it. 
My psychologist suggested that there are things that might indicate some issues with erotic triggers rather than gender identity issues. I said that I have wondered about that, but I am just struggling to let go of the thought that there is more to it than that. Also, we have just had 2 sessions, so still a bit more to uncover.

So this has been my journey so far:
First memory of crossdressing at age 6
2 memories between the age of 6 and 11 of being envious of my sisters for the dresses they got to wear.
Memories of me browsing through clothing magazines and dreaming of being or wearing what those models where wearing.
During puberty - more erotic turn, including masturbation and at times self bondage
Also during this time - first read about Caroline Cossey and what transexual was, and just being intrigued and curious.
Late teens - started buying porn magazines, and read bout trans women doing porn
At university - obsessed at times with sissy porn, sissy fiction stories
During my 20's - several times thinking that if I was really transgender then I would just disappear and live somewhere else so my family wouldn't have to deal with the shame. I also have 4 sisters and I felt that I would be robbing my family of their only son and brother.
Always used to tell myself that it was all just bogus, because I had never been interested in men, even if I had fantasies of having sex as a woman with men or male bodied I never felt attraction towards them.
Last time I did this was 8 years ago when I first started to date my wife.
In the last 7 years married I have only had the chance to crossdress a few times, either late at night or when she is away. We don't have a lot of money so we seldom go anywhere. My wife knew about my crossdressing, but thought I had stopped....
The last few years I have caught myself thinking that if I could do it again, and if I had grown up non Christian (used to think that being LGBT was wrong - I don't anymore) that I would have explored transitioning and living as a woman.... quite a big signal right there....
Also I had times where I wished that I had been an orphan or something so that I could just transition and live a new life somewhere else as a woman.

So, I guess with all this summed up the answer would that yes I am transgender.

Last weekend my wife was out of town, and I had our place to myself for the first time in 2 years, and so I decided to wear some of her clothes that I could fit in as much as I was able. I slept both nights in one of her nighties, and also wore some of her underwear and bra. It just felt nice and comfortable. I also did my nails and put a little makeup on... It did not feel uncomfortable at all, it felt nice and comfortable. Waking up in a nightie was just so nice. Also managed to tuck, and the experience just send like a little bit of an electric shock through my body.

So, I am struggling to see how it could be anything, but me being transgender, but there is still that lingering doubt. This could be related to the fear that I will loose my wife though, and that I will ruin her life. In one way I feel like saying, YES, I am transgender!, but then something in me just is like, but are you sure.... its so frustrating an annoying, and I feel that it will keep on going like this unless I do something.

So if anyone has any suggestions I am all ears."
auniqueun,asktransgender,Why do people try so hard to deny transphobia/enbyphobia/misogyny?,"All over the Internet and occasionally in real life, even in spaces reserved for trans people, if I tell someone about times I faced verbal harassment, threats, or occasionally even violence related to being trans, a girl, or both, the response is usually incredulity.

And even in trans spaces a lot of binary people are incredulous or outright hostile toward nonbinary genders and people with them.

[deleted],asktransgender,Being trans without any friends and social network..?,"I'm 25 years old, mtf and about 1+ month on a very low dose of HRT, I've no plans at all for coming out, as I struggle with social anxiety and the thought of people knowing is almost unbearable to me.

I feel like it's impossible to get to know people, because I'm so afraid of people finding out and I just don't know how to act around other people.. I feel so incredibly lonely and it all seems impossible and pointless and the obstacles are just too big, especially when I'm all alone like this..

 "
blepaway,asktransgender,Everything went to shit.,"This isn't a question, I'm sorry. I have to vent.

Remember I came out to my mother and she was supportive and understanding?

Over the past 8 weeks she's been progressively getting worse. See, it turns out she thought I was only complaining about depression and not fitting in until I had to outright tell her I'm very trans.

Since then, she's turned extremely cold. She's started denying everything to do with it and says I'm deluded and on the wrong path. She told me there isn't a feminine cell in my body and nothing I've ever done seems feminine. She says I can't possibly be trans because I never showed any sign of it as a kid (I regularly stole my sister's dresses and shoes). She broke her original promise to take me to my GP and continues to delay it every week, saying she'll take me and then never acting on it. She ignores most of my texts completely. She's refusing to let me on anything, even hormone blockers, until I'm 18. She's trying to force me to cut off communication with everyone I know online because she thinks they influenced me into being trans and says they're trying to force me to transition.  She wants the exact identities of everyone I know online too. She says I can't just expect to show up at college ""as a woman"".  ""This is very serious, it takes up to ten years of counselling"", ""I know what I'm talking about, and of course I understand"". Finally, she claims to have told my father about it, but says I'll eventually ""need to talk to him"". The way he acts gives me a clear impression that she's never said a word about it to him.

Edit: there's more to this. ""You can't be trans if you don't talk to girls."", ""You just need social interaction"", ""You can't be trans if you're not gay as a boy, because trans women can only be date men"".

So I'm stuck for the next two years at a college I'd rather not be at, one I picked purely with the intention to transition, while my mother insists on keeping me forced into this disgusting male persona.

Everything about this makes me suicidal.

HanaRiley,asktransgender,Should i be angrier than i am?,"So today has been an amazing day in a few different ways. 

A little background.

My wife left due to her not seeing herself as ever able to love a woman. I have been stressing for months about coming out at work, making it work with our daughter and still being friends.

So a month ago i started ""Girling up"" at work. Dropped the ties at first. then wore necklaces and bracelets. a little eye shadow and blush now and again. just random stuff. then got better cuts of pants. pink tops. I look pretty ok. still boy mode but fem. 

So i am stressing about when the boss is going to pull me aside and ask me to go back to my ties and why im dressing like this. he never has. But today i came so close. The topic of why i broke up with my wife had come up. I chickened out for fear of my job. but he is the only one who doesn't know. 

I expressed my self loathing for not just saying it to my manager. he laughed and told me that he had told the owner 2 weeks ago, because he was asked directly. I was initially more upset but im not really even slightly angry with him now. should i be?

NateG12,asktransgender,Should I come out?,"I'm gonna be home from college for Thanksgiving, and so are a bunch of my old friends from high school last year. I've recently come to terms with who I am (yay for new flair) and I want to talk it over with some of my friends. I'm not sure how everyone will react, but I think there's one in particular that would be accepting since we've been good friends for a few years and he came out as gay earlier this year. I feel like the group on the whole would be open to it, even though they've made some off color jokes in the past.

The thing I'm most concerned about is that another attached friend group is not as understading. While coming back from an all day trip I was considering casually working it in, but I was shocked when the subject of transgender people came up. It was fine until one said that non-binary people should be in a mental institution and the rest didn't dispute him. I feel like they might not have been completely serious though because we tend to have extremely dark senses of humor with little filter, but it shut me up for a solid 20 minutes.

Anyway, if I do, it would be to the friend I mentioned first."
SaturdaySartre,asktransgender,Mourning a cis-trans relationship,"I don't even know where to begin or what responses I'm looking for. I feel destroyed.

I came out as trans (ftm) to someone I love very much (really, the person I love the most) and thought that because he knows me better than anyone and because he's actively in support of the trans community, he would accept me and we would continue our relationship. I clung to the things he once said to me, like I'm perfect, there's nothing I could do to make him think otherwise, and he would always be there for me until I decide that I don't want him.

Instead I've been rejected in the most convoluted and painful way (short of actual violence). I'm finding it difficult to keep going - as both a human and progressing through my transition.

What I thought was unconditional love, wasn't. I feel utterly unacceptable and freakish. My depression has sky-rocketed. I want to give up on everything.

I feel extra pathetic because even after he has said some profoundly hurtful things, all I can think about is that I hope he's okay. He told me that it gives him a ""sense of comfort and renewal"" that I'll never be able to contact him again and here I am thinking ""please please please be okay"" every night before I fall asleep.

I think what happened is that he found a way to get over me/us by hating me. I've become a lightening rod for all of his problems (anxiety, depression, abandonment issues, etc).

I don't want to hate him to move on. How else can I move on? It's been months and there's no end in sight to this mourning. 

Have you lost someone at the beginning of your transition? What did you do to get over it? How long did it take?

guisar,asktransgender,Spinegasm?,"How common is 'spinegasm'?

There doesn't seem a specific event which triggers it, it just happens during sex. At the same time, it feels like there are other sensations which I haven't 'gotten to' yet. I'm a lesbian and pre-op.

I wanted to see how common this is or maybe if it's a 'stage' which changes after srs."
Napstablooregard,asktransgender,Financial advice?,"Hello again, r/AskTransgender!

As many of you know, the process of transition is expensive, and lots of people don't have the funds to do so. My question is: are there any organizations or groups that help trans folk in paying for their transition?"

Nate_E_7,asktransgender,Heeeeeeelp please! I don't know if I'm trans or not.,"Hey so I'm sorry about this because y'all probably get a shit ton of posts like this but I'm going insane over this.

So, currently I am a boy and 13 years old and I can't tell if I'm trans or not.

So from a physical stand point, I feel like I should have a vagina. Like, when I think about it that feels so much better than what I have now. Also boobs and that. The problem is I can't tell if I want these things or if it's just the product of some weird ass sex hormone thing considering I am 13. 

However when I think about being a girl there's just this warm feeling that comes over me and it's just feels right. Also, when I think about myself in the future I think of me being a girl and things like that.

Another problem is that my personality is definitely in the middle leaning towards masculine, but that's also the problem of me being scared to express myself. I'm also 13 and I know that my personality is going to change and right now it looks like it's changing towards feminine. But also when I try to act feminine I feel like a caricature of myself and I feel like I'm over exaggerating and trying too hard. I don't know though

So I don't know and I want to be absolutely certain I'm trans before I transition because I would hate to be a piece of evidence of transgenderism not being real. Just, I don't know, please help."

  I would really like to transition, but i am afraid i might regret this decision, because i am attracted to women (and i am not sure if there are trans women who are lesbians), i have mostly male friends, i don't hate being male and after i googled about trans people, i found plenty of trans girls saying that they hated their genitalia, and being male was depressing to them, and i do not share this feeling, i just think that i will be happier as a girl.Because of these factors, i am not sure if i am trans or just confused.

PS: Sorry for the broken english, i am still learning the language."
doittuit,asktransgender,22M Long post on whether I should transition from mtf or not.,"Ever since I was a little boy Ive always looked up to my older sister. Shes 3 years older than me and really succesful. Shes everything I wish I could be. She's smart, funny, super confident, pretty, gets into relationships easily (Ive had 1 gf in my 22 years of living and we only kissed...thats it), has a good job, happy relationships, good friends and most of all...she was born female. Growing up her and I played dress up amd other feminine things like that. So at a young age I learned that I would rather want to wear girl clothes instead of boys. So in middle school I started wearing tigher jeans, shoes and shirts (These were all clothes for guys. Just skater clothes I guees you could say). Almost immediately I was bullied for what I wore to school. It has been over a decade, but I still remember what this bully said to me that day in his sarcastic tone. ""Hey nice tight jeans. Do you like the way they make your butt feel?"" 

Ever since then my self worth and confidence began to plumet. I started doing bad in school, and making up excuses to my parents that I was sick or something so I wouldnt be bullied, since I still wore my comfortable fitting clothes even after the bullying. Around this time in middle school a lot of changes start to happen to a young boys body...puberty. This is where I really started questioning things about myself. I started stealing my sisters clothes to wear when no one was home. Just to feel normal. Like Id just then do the rest of my day, but just in girl mode until my family came home. Then eventually my sister, mom and dad found out...I remember running to my room crying while I hear my sister sobbing to my dad saying ""It's not normal! He's a fucking freak!"" This happened at the end of my senior year of highschool...and a lot of shit has happened since then and where I am now 4 years later. 

My family did not take the news well that I had been cross dressing. My sister hated me and would tell me to kill myself. My alcoholic right winged father found my sisters clothes, underwear, bra and shoes and through them at me with enough force to knock me back amd sit speechless on the ground. All the while he yells at me. I could smell the vodka on his breath when he said ""You better not pull this fucking shit again! Do you hear me?!"" My mom was the only one that talked to me and was supportive. Yet still my mom (who was a psychology major in college) thought I was just confused or that it was a phase. She did however, do the whole ""You know if youre gay it is okay, and I still love you no matter what."" Talk, even though I wouldnt say Im gay, but more bisexual if anything. Anyways so from that point on I never told anyone about my thoughts of being a girl, except my mom, but even then I still found it hard to talk about certain subjects.

So then after highschool I had my first relationship thay didnt last long sadly. I knew this girl for awhile, but I just wasnt confident enough or had the 'experience' of being in a relationship. So the break up crushed me and I began spiraling out of control, but also started to question who I was. I became extremely depressed, had an aweful view on my body (probably due to the gender dysphoria), and began having to seek therapist and psychiatrist because all my problems were getting out of hand. I began cutting myself because I hated myself, my body and because of the endorphine rush that it triggered, I attempted suicide because of another fight with my sister about taking her clothes and she told me again to ""kill yourself"". The therapy and psychiatry did help with the anxiety, depression and ADHD I was dealing with but the one thing I could never talk about was my gender dysphoria and wanting to transition. My mom would even let the therapist know about my sexual problems either with a phone vall or via a note to them. Still I would always feel way too umcomfortable talking about it because of all the things that happened in the past that engraved in my mind society doesnt like people who do those things. 


Almost done here folks. Thanks for reading this far. It feels really, really good to be able to talk to someone about this. Eventually though, my dysphoria, extreme depression, anxiety and other problems led to me self harm more. Though I was able to quit self harming...because I began abusing drugs instead. From weed, coke amphetamines to xanax, lsd, mdma, but of all the drugs Ive done the ones I fell in love with were the opiates. I was addicted to heroin for 3 years because it made everything feel okay. Well I went to rehab and now Im sober, but now Im having all these feelings again about transitioning and dysphoria and whatnot. I guess it is because Ive been numbing those feelings out for years...and now theyre back.

 really wish society would be way more understanding about being trans. I feel like the only trans that make it are the ones that pass really well. Which is probably one of the many reasons I havent transistioned yet. Ill transistion if I pass, but I wont know if I pass if I dont do a transition. Its a terrible cycle of thoughts....god why cant society be more accepting of boys and girls who arent comfortable in their own bodies and help them out in any and every way they can? It would make transitioning easier and probably would help more people pass. Because then people could give feedback, give tips, doctors could help do things that can make a man more feminine and other professinals of varying fields could also help. Instead of me being in the closet, keeping everything a secret and trying to learn mannerisms, how to talk, walk, dress, hairstyles and also makeup which I think is huge because I suck at doing makeup. For fucks sake I wish I could at least come out more to my older sister so she could help and support me. As weve recently have gotten a lot more closer now, but Im just still afraid of what she may think. Also id like to talk to my mom more as her my sister could help with makeup and what type of outfits to wear. Then my mom is a hairstylest so she could help me with my hair, eyebrows and other facial stuff. It seems like I have all the tools in my hands that can help me transition really well, but sadly I am way too afraid of society. Like what my mom, dad, sister, friends, co workers, classmates and what other family members would think and say too. Sorry for the long post, but I LITERALLY have no one to talk to about this. So being able to talk to people who understand is a huge help. Thanks for reading, and thank you all so, so much for any feedback or support. It truly means a lot to me as like ive said. I talk to no one about this.

TL;DR-Grew up wishing to be a girl. Sister and dad arent having it, moms a bit supportive. Did therapy, but felt too uncomfortable about talking about transitioning because societies negative view. Became depressed, started cutting myself, tried suicide and experimemted with lots of drugs and became addicted to heroin. Im clean now, but now all the feelings of wanting to transition and be a girl are back after numbing them out with heroin. Thanks for reading and feedback! SUPER APPRECIATE IT!!!"
liv_rose,asktransgender,"How to explain ""feeling gender"" to a cis person?","So today, I came out to my cis female partner. I told her that I'd been questioning my gender and think I might be trans. It went ok, all things considered, but my main point is this - she, in her own words, just doesn't understand gender. She doesn't understand how you can have any internal sense of gender. She's not close-minded, she just doesn't understand it. She wanted to know what made me feel like a woman, and not like a man. I tried to explain it but couldn't come up with anything other than ""it's just how I feel"". It's a feeling I can't really put into words. Does anyone have any way to explain this feeling, in a way that someone who's never thought to question their gender can understand?"

thewandererrR,asktransgender,"I'm a bisexual, bipolar male looking for advice as I'm struggling to deal with my pre-HRT MtF partner's dysphoria and other issues."," Hello, as the title says I'm struggling with my relationship in general but lately it's been very difficult it was our 1 year anniversary, we moved in together and I started university. I've been commited to my partner since last september when she came out to me, I was struggling with serious mental health issues at that time and allowed my love for her to suppress any doubts and questions I had. I have always supported her to the extent that I've put my mental health below her needs which backfired terribly causing me to attempt suicide and get institutionalised resulting in the diagnosis of bipolar type 2 disorder. I know I haven't asked a particular question other than a plea for advice but I feel the backround information is important, finally I had an accident that resulted in serious surgery and a chronic pain disorder thats it for backround. 

I have learnt over the past year that this wasn't an issue that was going away and I helped her get into a gender identity clinic which is preparing for HRT to start soon, the issue is lately the dysphoria has gotten so frequent and awful that she's been missing university and has been inconsolable. Once again I'm ignoring my own health to help, my pain disorder has increased in severity as tolerance to pain meds ramps up and bipolar episodes have been so severe I nearly attempted suicide twice only the thought of how much I will hurt her and my family stopping me. I just want her to feel like her true self and atleast be somewhat happy or atleast not dysphoric not for my sake but hers. Sorry for the wall of text. Any advice will be appriciated greatly, thank you.

waking up today, i remembered a dream i had last night. in my dream, i attempted to stop hrt. i dont remember if i decide to or not, but the thought made me extermely confused. im not confused about the fact that im trans, but i am confused on what i should do. if i stop hrt there' a possibility that my dysphoria may stop and return to the point it was before hrt; however the more likely out come is that nothing will change and my dysphoria will continue and worsen over time. after all im compareing my time before and after i realized im trans.

there' also the fact that i dont want to stop hrt. i want to change, i want to be a girl and i dont want to put my progress on hold. i understand that there' no time that' too late to start hrt... but that' before starting hrt... after starting hrt and then decide to stop is just too much. im 29 i forcefully removed my desire to transtion at 22, buried my feeling and forced myself forget everything regarding transitioning at the time. now i finally accepted my situtition i will hate myself to the extreme if i put my transition on hold again.

flockofrappingcrows,asktransgender,Am I trans? I need input before I go seek therapy.,"I've always been a secretive person, even to my closest friends and family members, so talking to a therapist will be like pulling teeth. I say I am and I know that should be enough, but I have always sought input before taking action so this is my way of doing it anonymously.

I felt like I may be trans for years but my desire to not stir the pot with my family and other doubts kept me from seriously contemplating therapy or transitioning. I never particularly liked my body since puberty or the fact I am a male, but just went along with how the biological roll of the dice turned out. 

As the years rolled by my dislike for my body gave rise to the envy for a female one. I dismissed it over and over, only for the feelings to come back a little bit stronger. I went so far as to join the military to attempt to ""purge"" the thoughts or at least keep me focused on something else and it worked for a while.

But for the past two years I have felt I am at my wits end as my desires have only grown more intense as I try to ignore them on a daily basis. After I found a small patch of hair on my head starting to thin a few weeks ago I felt this intense hatred for my body that took me back. Each time I see myself in the mirror my thoughts drift to this ""change or end it""

I can't concentrate on anything or even more forward in my life any more. What started as a ""What if"" at 15 has now evolved into a daily struggle 11 years later. I just have this feeling that if I can't be who I want to be on the outside then what's the point of doing anything else?"

Ever since HRT, I have nearly sworn off anything sugary. It near makes me sick now, and that's a real problem because a really easy way to gain weight is to eat a lot of sugars. Now, I live through what a bunch of other trans people seem to go through,  really high sodium craving. Though in my experience, this doesn't cause much weight gain...

[deleted],asktransgender,Am I trans?,"Sorry if this is not appropriate for this subreddit or if my terminology is off..or otherwise being completely stupid and naive.

I'm a person in their 40's who, until a month ago would have said that he's cis-male.  I am a sub (BDSM wise) and my (now ex lol) Domme was introducing the possibility of feminising me.  I was not at all bothered by this - quite the opposite and we talked about it quite a lot.  As soon as conversation had gone on for a while, it was like my mind exploded and I remembered a fuckton of experiences / desires in the past e.g. cross-dressing, recurrent dreams (of being in a female role), chilling my head by imagining myself female bodied (it's weird, but I just will lie there and imagine how it would feel with breasts and hips..it's relaxing, not sexual), painting toenails, pretending to be female (for about year) in an online game etc.

Suddenly it clicked that *I may actually be trans*..and I've been going through waves of confusion about it since.  I'm not terribly distressed or anything, just unsure about..err..what I am.  I find myself checking out women and looking at what they're wearing, how they carry themselves.  I look in the mirror..and things are weird now.  I'm a bald embearded male, not ugly..but I look far away from female. My bestest bud asked me if I could be born again or have a magic pill, would I be cis-female and it was an emphatic 'yes'.

OTOH..

If I were to transition, I just wouldn't want to do it if there was no chance of me passing.  If it makes any sense, wouldn't mind not being a terribly attractive woman..but would have to be identifiable as a woman.

[deleted],asktransgender,"[mtf] hrt, vomiting and nose bleeds.","So I just recently started hrt on the 22nd. 100mg spiro and 2mg oral estradiol. Iv been taking them together every morning along with some vitamins which iv been taking for a while now. 10mg biotin and 50mg zinc. 

Before I started hrt I has sick for a bit with a cold however now I'm fine with just a cough trying to rid whatever's left in my chest. Occasionally I'll have a coughing fit that gets to the point I end up vomiting which then would cause my nose to start bleeding for a bit, 5 - 10 minutes before the bleeding stops. 

Iv read that spiro can make you dehydrated which would make my sinuses dry and after vomiting would cause a raise in blood pressure which would then cause the nose bleed.

So my concern is, is this just a mix of event causing all this or could it be the medication or the mix of them screwing up things, and if I should get in contact with my endo and see if my dosage needs adjusting?"

Su25Thunderfrog,asktransgender,Forms of estrogen &amp; experiences?,"So obviously, we all will have very different experiences as we all have very different bodies, but I'm just curious if there are any general experiences that are associated across similar forms of getting hormones. I personally rely on the patch currently (fun fact: there is a generic version of the vivelle dot patch that is much cheaper), but started out taking pills sublingually. I feel like my transition has gone fairly slow relative to those on the pill and doing shots, but I don't have any way to truly and accurately compare, so it's not much more than a feeling. 1.5 years in and I have B cups, a little bit of a booty, and my face has femmed up significantly. Most of this occurred between 6 mo and 1 year.

Anyone else wanna posy their experiences with different methods of delivery for estrogen?"

For reals.,"So I'm AFAB and fairly andro with pan/poly tendencies Wife (AMAB) is VERY femme and VERY .... slutty, don't hate me, it's HER freakin word for herself. Hormones are on and good, house, dogs, cats, food for all, school, life, things should be fine (even though we have VERY few real friends and it sucks but we got each other, right?). Problem is, I can't do anything right. Do her laundry? Did it wrong, did the wrong things, etc, get yelled at. Do exactly what I need to go to school the next day (STRICT dress code for my degree! includes ironing! -- culinary), get yelled at for not doing hers (see point one) and also most of what I wash sola mia is Pure. Freakin. White. Bleach and all. No, not washing her multicolored lingerie in the same load, but it's still wrong. Example: I don't even wear underwear. Somehow got yelled at that I only washed mine and not hers when I was only washing her things and I seriously grabbed things she might wear in the next week and threw them in as I had to FLY to class right then. I cannot make sense of this no matter how hard I try. Late by ten minutes to make sure she had laundry that didn't chafe (after she put it off for over two weeks) only to get yelled at that I only washed my undies and none of hers. BS. I added ONE pair of my pants (dress code and all) but that was it, the rest was hers. I don't get it.
I'm trying to talk her into counseling and/or meds for depression/anxiety but I can't push too hard ... bet most everyone here can guess why ... but I'm really concerned about her AND myself AND our relationship AND things just canNOT continue as they have been. I don't have anyone IRL to ask, no support system, nothing. Just her. And while I can go to counseling and take my own meds, I can't make her take care of herself. At all. Not with the dentist, the endo, the eye doc, her PCP, none of it.
I don't know what to do. Sex life has gone to crap cause I'm not attracted to who she's become and she only wants me to do her (not switch, like we used to). I'm completely lost right now. I don't want to lose her but it feels like I already have.
I bring her food I made at school anyway.

I'm usually quick to notice a chaser but these men don't seem to be chasers. They are very much respectful and interested in me as a person. They many times don't even care if I'm pre or post op. They're all about dating and postponing sexy times for whenever I'm ready. They're emotionally avalible and open for commitment. So what do you make of this?

I was thinking I should come out to a friend first,  but in the end it would just be them trying to convince me to tell my parents. Telling my parents is the only way any actual change or transition can happen. So I'm going to do it. Dad comes later. My mom is extremely understanding and supportive. Expect good reaction, but don't know how to actually do it. I was thinking calling her into her room and talking and dropping the bombshell and just explaining it. But then I thought it would be easier if she read about it or something, then we discuss. Or I could just write a letter, not an idea I like. If I give her stuff to read, I'd like a really really REALLY intro into transgender, specifically mtf, people, and what exactly what I'm trying to accomplish (transition, hormones, surgery, etc.) Not a resource too simple, but not confusing. Wouldn't make sense to unload the entire gender spectrum onto her at once, just my experience will suffice.

I guess I'm just asking how I should go about it. And resources to give to her."

I got my eyebrows shaped (ouch!) and then got dressed real cute and my wife and I went on a little shopping spree we had been saving up for, for a long while and I got some new clothes so I can actually start dressing how I want. It was a ton of fun and I think I passed pretty well! No funny looks or people laughing! It was amazing!

After it all and being so excited and proud of myself I asked my mom and sister if they wanted to see how pretty I looked. My mom was amazing and said I looked really pretty and was super happy for me! When I asked if my sister wanted to see a picture of her new twin (we look a lot alike!) She didn't respond... So I talked to my mom about it when I was at home driving my dad to and from a surgery. She said she'd talk to her. 

Last night my sister texted me saying she was sorry for not responding and was having difficulties dealing with losing her brother but made sure to tell me she supports me fully, she's just having trouble dealing with the change.

So I told her don't think about it like losing a brother, you're gaining a sister! I let her know if she wants to talk or anything, I'd be more than happy to... Never got a reply from her. What can I do to help her with this? My sister and I have never been super close and it's something I've been looking forward to, hoping being sisters would bring us closer.

ijihara,asktransgender,A beautiful but stressful LDR,"Ever since HRT I've been more prone to stress. I love the changes.

In my last one (my only other one), I could drive to go see her, she was ""only"" 600 miles away, or less when she lived in atlanta.

He's the most supportive man I've ever met. If I wasn't already bi I'm pretty sure I'd go gay for him. I can honestly, honestly say I've never ever met anyone like him. He reads me poetry, he writes them, we exchange literary analysis. And he's *good*. His poetry is *amazing*. He likes the classical music I write, too. He thinks I'm just as talented. He sat through a 12 minute classical suite I wrote and told me it was wonderful, that I even had an intuitive understanding of symphonic writing. He encourages me to do more. He is always there if I need to cry. He'll stay up with me if I really want him to. His thoughts on Buddhism and meditation are inspiring at the very least. The ludicrous speed in which this thing even developed scares me, a little bit - I met him literally a week ago. And I've spent every waking minute talking to him because we just have an innate trust. I feel like I already know him because he reminds me a lot of myself, if I were ever really a man. And if I were ever dominant.  I seriously, cannot ever see myself leaving him. He may as well have soulmate written on his forehead. (and I *won't* leave him, in case anyone was thinking that)

But...

 he is 2600 miles away. I live in Alabama and he lives in Oregon. Luckily we're financially well off, I can see him soon by flying out, but... how do you handle it?

So I've been kinda worried so I went to my primary care physician and she told me a chest exam would be a obgyn thing but since my records are male I can't have access to one because of a loophole. My endocrinologist just called saying she didn't see the need for me to have a breast exam until ten years on hormones.

We've been doing this about once every 6-8 weeks for at least 5 years, which is about the only time we see each other anymore (except for the one I called Morgan, who I've seen a few times a year outside of that, been to his birthday parties, etc. We also were a bit closer friends all along). I told them about my transition early on, and they've all been ""supportive"". I'm starting to think that maybe it's more ""non-hostile / neutral"" than ""supportive"" though, since they don't seem to care enough to consistently gender me correctly.

Anyway. Tonight was really extra annoying to me because, for the first time, Robert invited a new friend (Jimmy) who just moved here from out of state, who doesn't know me. And they outed me to him through their behaviour.

I could barely wait until our last game wrapped up and I could get out of there, and then I cried for most of the drive home.

So I've written the letter below, and am planning to send it to them tomorrow. Please tell me:

* Am I being overly harsh?

* Should I even bother to try to separate the fact that Robert is the biggest offender and Morgan is barely an offender at all? I don't want it to seem like I'm attacking Robert though.

* Or is it okay to treat it as a group problem as currently written?

* How would you make this letter better?

Thanks for your feedback!

------------------------------------

Dear Robert, David and Morgan,

I am happy to consider all of you friends. We've known each other off and on for over 16 years, the vast majority of our adult lives. I don't know if we're at ""true friends help you move bodies"" level, but hey, let me know next time you have a body to move and we'll find out, alright?

We need to make a change to our respective relationships. I don't know what kind of change that will be, but I know what I'd like it to be; I'd like for it to be a change from being a relationship between ""you and that guy you used to work with who is now a woman"" to ""you and that (totally adorable) woman you used to work with, who was hiding the fact that she's a woman for the first 14 years you knew her, and thanks you kindly to keep that fact to yourself.""

It's been over 18 months since I told you all about my transition. It's been over 16 months since the last time you saw me presenting myself as anything but female. It's been over 13 months since I presented to *anyone, anywhere* as anything but female, and about that long since anyone who didn't know me pre-transition has misgendered me. In all of 2016, I can count the number of times I've been misgendered on one hand, including all the times by family members who've known me since I was a child. 

Until tonight. Tonight I ran out of fingers and toes to count them with in decimal, and had to switch to using my fingers to count in binary. You did it so much that even Jimmy picked up on it and misgendered me once. He looked a bit confused, and he actually corrected himself immediately. (I trust you didn't actually tell him in advance about my medical history and he was just picking up on the fact that Robert and David kept calling me ""he"", and probably he also noticed the one time I called way too much attention to it by saying ""she, please"" to Robert because it was getting really irksome. If you did tell him in advance, then make sure that's the last time you ever do that to me, because that is *exceptionally* rude. The #1 rule of being supportive of your trans friends is ""You do NOT out them to anyone without their permission,"" which, if you didn't know before, now you do. You may think people will ""just notice"" because you don't see me as that different from before, but trust me, they won't. It's been a loooong time since anyone has. Moving on....)

This wasn't at all a balanced problem -- some of you misgender me far more often than others, and you ALL get it right on a semi-regular basis too (so, thanks for only stabbing me some of the time?).

So there's a problem to solve here, guys. Let's try to come up with a solution to the problem -- it's been long enough now that ""just give it time"" is not a viable answer anymore. You're not doing any better than you were a year ago. If you still see me as a guy who wants to be referred to as a woman, then it's no wonder you're still screwing it up regularly (especially after a beer or two). You need to actually internalize that I really am a woman. 

So please, each of you, come up with your own plan, knowing your own minds as you do, to solve this for yourself. Because make no mistake, it is each of your problem. Here's a suggestion, though (take it or leave it): Practice. Inside your own head, or out loud to your significant others or to each other (so you're not outing me to anyone new), try describing the woman you see when you look at me. Describe the feminine qualities you see. Tell a story about something that happened a decade ago, but tell it describing me as ""u/Kaetlynn"" and ""she"". Keep doing this until it's second nature, and you realize you don't actually perceive me as male any longer. Or come up with your own plan. I don't care what your plan is, but make a plan and do it. Tell each other what that plan is, to help each other out in case someone's stuck for ideas! Tell me what that plan is so I know you care enough to actually work on this.

I still don't expect you to solve it overnight, but I *do* expect you to make progress. And if it turns out you don't actually care enough to do this, then please tell me that too, so I can stop holding out hope that it's going to get better only to have it trampled in the mud every time I see you. By the way, this is the reason that I haven't wanted to start a new Legacy game since we finished the last one. I don't want to commit to that long of a game series until you can all prove you can make it through a 4 hour session without misgendering me, like *literally everyone else in my life* can do.

Love,
u/Kaetlynn"

Little background on me: I'm 23, working full time for a small business that does offer a healthcare plan (I'm like 75% certain they offer aflac.) But I'm looking to leave said small business so I can transition comfortably/start school. Would be filing single. However I may end up not being able to leave my current workplace because my bills are so high. (Currently spending $490/month on car/health insurance and car payments.) I would be filing as a male, and I live in Missouri.

Currently I'm on the ACA marketplace plan with Humana, being charged about $120 a month. Was alerted earlier this month that my plan will be disapearing at the end of the month. Which is fine cause it sucked anyway and didn't cover anything I needed it to (it didn't cover my trip to the emergancy room, and caused me grief when looking for an endo who would take my insurance.) 

So I'm being forced to find a new plan, the plan I was on was some dumb specialized plan (like a step up from catastrophic.) 

So my question is this: should I go through my work (that I'm actively trying to leave, but may not) or try to work out a new plan through humana that works better for me or go through a third option that is more trans friendly that I'm not aware of?"

I dont have big muscles for the most part and have began to use less weight when training along with more reps and focusing on cardio. so for the question, i was wondering what all of the effects of just using testosterone blockers were and if it was viable to use them for at least half a year before i begin HRT. One of the reason i want to use them is because of the possibility that my bones may get larger as they stop fusing at 22 or 25.

TransThrowaway01957,asktransgender,Any other MtF's have a similar experience with masturbation?,I think I started masturbating when I was around 15 years old and only did it maybe once or twice every month or so for a long time and then briefly did it weekly for a year or so before I started to realize I was trans. I still occasionally masturbate every now and then.  The thing is I’ve never used my hands before.  I really don’t like to look at my dick and the only way i’ve ever masturbated is prone masturbation.  Although I’m asexual and not too interested in having sex I do get slightly aroused imagining myself having a vagina and being penetrated when I masturbate. I’m just wondering if there is anyone else who experienced the same thing
mining_bat,asktransgender,I'm not sure if I should transition,"I don't know 100% if I want to. My desire to undergo the transition change. Some days I feel like I am truly a girl.

Dcfan7738,asktransgender,To come out to Dad now or Delay? (kind of long),"I'm 38 years old MAAB who has early this year accepted myself.  I took time to decide if transitioning is what I need to do and have recently decided that I will transition.  I've got a therapist appointment coming up soon and hope to start on hrt very soon (preferably by my 39th birthday in a couple of months).  When I first started considering this I thought I would wait to be on hormones for awhile before coming out.

I came out to my mom this past weekend, it didn't go bad, she just didn't seem to be affected by it other than telling me she loves me regardless.  I've accepted that maybe she doesn't know how to react.

But the person that I want to be out to the most is my dad, I just don't want to hide anything as I go through the changes.  I know he will not disown me or anything, just because of the kind of person he is.  He grew up without his father in his life and to this day at the age of 57 he sacrifices himself or constantly worries about me and two brothers, and one of them is not his biological child which he knew from day 1 but that did not stop him from loving him and as far as he concerned, my brother is his son.

That being said, my two brothers have put him through hell, my 33 year old brother is ok when he doesn't drink or take pills and never held down a steady job.  The 25 year old also has never held down a steady job, has 4 kids (each with different moms and only knows where 2 of them are) and constantly fighting with his girlfriend where my dad has to go get him.

Between them, his job who takes advantage of him and his health, I'm not sure how much more he can take.  

Although he doesn't know anything about me being trans or if he suspects it, he is always telling me how proud he is of me, and when I hint around he always tells me to not worry that there is more to being a ""man"" and that a real man takes care of his responsibilities and children.

We've always had a bond although there have been times it has been strained.  We usually talk on the phone every morning because I worry about him and his health, and for years we always help each other when the other needs it and don't keep track of who owes who.

I'm sorry that was so long.  But that being said, I feel that I am ready to come out but I'm not sure if he is ready.  With everything going on, I don't want him to worry about me and my 8 year old daughter who I have full custody of.  Me being a dad myself, he will worry about her as he himself didn't have a father (although I will still be there as I always have been, albeit maybe in a more motherly role?).  But I'm also afraid he will blame himself thinking that he caused me to go through life with this pain and that he didn't do enough.  That's the furthest from the truth because I was never interested in things such as sports and working on cars and stuff.  But I know how he is, he makes himself carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and he will blame himself regardless.  

Again I'm sorry this was so long, but has anyone else gone through this with worrying about a parents existing health and stress?

I've been thinking of ways to slowly over a few weeks hint around to him so its not as big of a shock or at least bring the topic up but I'm stumped."

HackingHime,asktransgender,Any recommendations for a period tracker?,"Hello everyone!

[I've seen claims from AMAB people about having period symptoms](http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/05/31/yes-trans-women-can-get-period-symptoms/) and I'm interested in learning more. I feel like when this gets mentioned, it can turn into [team ""I've experienced that!"" vs. team ""that's total bullshit"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4vi5on/mtf_here_do_any_of_you_other_girls_use_period/) In this post I'm not trying to ask who believes it's real, but rather does anyone know of a good tool for testing this on oneself.

However, I am interested in seeing if I can find any regular patterns in myself that seem to mimic period like symptoms such as having hornier weeks, regular terrible poops (period shits), nausea, etc. I'm wondering if I can get any sort of success in this with a period tracking app.

I've looked at a few available on android and it doesn't seem like any of them can guess when I'm supposed to have a period based solely on non-bleeding symptoms. So I'm wondering if anyone else has looked into this before and has an app (or website/service/whatever) that they recommend, or if an AFAB person can recommend a good tracker just based on ones that they've used in the past.

Thanks in advance for all of your advice/recommendations! I hope this post helps people and can lead to some useful data on this subject.

Amireallyagirl,asktransgender,I don't know if I should transition! I'm literally on the verge of crying!,"

I'm so confused. I'm about to start HRT in a few months and I'm not sure who I am. I have been living as a girl and I've always had doubts. I've always been told I'm more then likely transgender. I'm not uncomfortable at all with living as a man. 
But, if I don't transiton now (I'm 18) because I don't think it's right, what if I decide later after I've masculinised and my voice is so deep and my my face is so masculine i can't pass? 

I'd like to go back to living as a boy in some ways. It was easier. I never doubted I was a man. Or a gay male.

EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Internalised Transphobia/Enbyphobia or just confused?,"I'm not too sure how best to explain how I feel but in essence its that I really want to be a girl but inside I don't feel like I am, I feel like I'm agender. When I self identified as nonbinary/agender it felt so much better than identifying as a girl but I don't know if that's because in my head ""there's no way I could pass I look to masculine to be a girl, but if I'm no gender then that doesn't matter"". I don't know if its internalised transphobia making me think I can't be a girl, or enbyphobia that I don't feel comfortable being nb therefore I want to be a girl so I fit the binary. But right now they/them pronouns feel better than he/him and she/her.

I mean I know that specific labels don't matter all too much but feeling like I don't know what I am makes it hard for me to make the steps forward in terms of coming out. I'm out to a lot of my friends as trans (so they'd assume binary female) and a few as agender so its probably really confusing for them and it is a bit for me. My nuclear family just know trans and don't really get non binary even though I've tried to explain it and I doubt my extended family would get it either. In my mind I'd end being very feminine in my presentation so it wouldn't actually matter to them not knowing? Even though they pronouns are my preferred right now maybe I'd be fine with them just using she/her? 

Then there's the name thing, the name I really wanted which was gender neutral but slightly feminine is way too similar to my brothers name (Skye) so I thought about making it my middle name and using Eloise/Elise (my fave girl names right now) instead but thinking about Skye makes me giddy and happy whereas Eloise/Elise just feels a bit eh.

Momjenn,asktransgender,Need advice about daughter coming out as transgender.,"My 17 year old daughter has come out as transgender.  She is gay and though it is not my first choice for her, more because it can be a hard life with so many mean people in this world I totally except it.  I want her to be happy and honestly I don't think it is a big deal.  Love is love weather between same sex or opposite sex couples and love is good.  We have to much hate I this world for me to worry about Love! Anyway, Two weeks ago she was stealing my make up but she was never overly girly. Now she is dressing like a boy and cut all her hair off.  I can't say I am thrilled about it but I will get use to it.  I want her to be happy and if that makes her happy I am ok with it, not that it is for me to say...  I want her to be happy. I have no real problem calling her by a boys name.  Am I sad about kinda losing my little girl, yes. But that is my issue not hers.  I will support her.  Here is my issue that I need help with.  She wants to take male hormones.  I am against this at such a young age simply because some of the changes will not be reversible if she regrets her decision.  The major one being that she will become sterile and not be able to have children.  At 17 I did not want to have kids, at 20 I did not but by 23 I did!  I just feel at 17 you are so young and to make such a life altering decision at that age seems like not a good idea. If she were 24 or 25 I would be so much more comfortable.  Any input would be helpful... I just want to do the right thing.  She needs my consent to do it .  I prefer she wait until she is older...  Thank you for your advice!"

Harpoon385,asktransgender,"For anyone questioning their gender, again","I know I keep posting this, but I mwan, after a day nobody sees it anymore.

I very frequently see people who are questioning their gender asking the same thing (not that it is bad that they ask these questions), and who get caught up in certain aspects of this.

Being transgender and scared does not mean you are cisgender. It is absolutely reasonable to be scared when you are questioning your gender and believe you are transgender, but that doesn't mean you are cisgender. Don't think you are the only trans person out there who is scared, you are not, it's very common.

Having doubts is normal. This is a big, life changing decision that does not come without risks, so of course you will be unsure if this is the right thing to do. However try not to get too caught up in the dumb excuses as to why you are not transgender. The simplest explanation is most likely the right one.

Just because you think you might not be able to pass, or only want to transition if you will pass doesn't make you cisgender. This one should be obvious.

Never assume all transgender people feel a certain way, or that your narrative is 100% unique and all transgender people do not feel the way you do. So many people seem to think this, but it's not true.

You are not delusional, you are not making this all up in your head for attention, and you are not making yourself feel this way. You would know if you were doing this for attention or forcing yourself to feel this way.

You do not need to experience gender dysphoria to be transgender.

You can realize you are transgender at any age.

I hope this helped somebody who is currently questioning their gender. I probably missed a few things, but I didn't want it to be too long. I only mean this as a guide, I apologize if anything was inaccurate, I'm simply trying to help.

Edit: Could this be stickied perhaps? It's better than constantly asking the same questions all the time."

koolsla,asktransgender,"I'm a little uncomfortable when my parents acknowledge that I'm trans, is this normal?","While I've had the suspicion in the back of my mind for a while, I only really came to acknowledge and accept the fact that I'm trans a few months ago. I've come out to 3 people so far: my best friend, and my parents. All of them have been extremely accepting, which I am very grateful for.
Now, whenever my friend calls me a guy or uses he/him pronouns for me, it feels great. It just feels so... *right*. It makes me really happy. 
With my parents, on the other hand, it's just really... uncomfortable. When my mum calls me her ""little boy"" it just feels weird. My dad asked if I wanted him to teach me how to shave, and while I think shaving is something I'll definitely have to do in the future, I really just... don't want him to mention it. It's weird. It's like I would just prefer my parents to keep calling me a girl, to use she/her pronouns, and just treat me the same way they always have.
Is this... normal? Has anyone else felt like this? I just feel so wrong for being uncomfortable with this, since my parents are actually being very supportive of me. I'm hoping this is just something that takes time, but I think it would help to know if other trans people have had similar feelings.
(also this is my first time posting on reddit so i'm hoping it doesn't end up in the wrong place or anything)"
debraMckenz,asktransgender,Summary of my story - might be similar to many,"*Originally wrote this for the ""It's Worth it"" campaign...which I don't think is alive anymore.*

I knew from very young that I was different from other boys around me and yet I couldn't quite put a finger on what it was exactly. I grew up in a very closed-minded world and yet it was all I had ever known. So it's really no wonder that any gender dysphoric feelings I experienced were subconsciously buried deeply in my heart before they could even reach a formed idea. Of course there were hints along the way but like those subconscious feelings, they were snatched away, even fought against mercilessly.

This is why I didn't even discover crossdressing until age 27. But once I did, it began something that what would soon burst the bubble that I had thought was my perfect life. The fabric of my heart that had sealed away each gender dysphoric feeling, thought, and idea began to rip at the seams. I struggled with questions like: ""Why do I feel like this?"", ""Am I damned to hell?"", ""What will others think?"", and even ""How can I live like this?"" I worried about the losses I would incur from transition. I could lose my family, my wife, my home, my job, my friends, and maybe even my soul. And yet I couldn't keep on living like I was.

Don't get me wrong, I had lived a full life, I was successful in my career, a college graduate, married, and a home owner. Yet in my heart, I knew something was missing, something was off. If you go back to old pictures of me, you can see it in my eyes even when I smiled; no light there. And now I finally knew the reason for that feeling, I knew exactly what was missing and yet the journey loomed before me. So much pain; so much loss.

Many of us end up in quite the same conundrum: transition or die. Those around me expected me to find a third option; an option that included living and yet fighting against that part of myself that was trying to emerge. What they may not have realized is that by pushing me away from the idea of transitioning, they were not pushing me toward any third option, but instead toward the only remaining option I saw before me: death.

On September 2, 2009 at around 5:00am, I attempted to commit suicide. The details of how I went about it are not important but the fact that I was unsuccessful is something I am thankful for now in so many ways. However at the time, I was in a bad state. I committed myself to the psych ward of a nearby hospital because I didn't know what else to do. I felt so lost, so numb. My family and wife came to visit me there but not much was exchanged. There was still no solution. None of them would ever even suggest transition.

During an exercise at a group session at the psych ward, we had the chance to open up about ourselves and my blatant honesty with everyone was rewarded with acceptance. That was the first glimmer of hope I experienced. These strangers that didn't know me from Adam were accepting of the fact that I felt like a woman inside and intensely needed to transition my body and my life to match. While sometimes it truly is easier for people who don't know you to accept you, it still told me that if I could make this change, it just might be worth it.

I began transition and things did not get any easier. My parents became immediately estranged from me, my wife separated from and soon divorced me, my church all but excommunicated me, and many friends dropped off the map as well. I grieved for my losses, all of them, periodically throughout my transition yet not without beginning to appreciate life. The dreary Seattle weather outside my window was of no consequence in comparison to the rays of sunshine in my heart. I had embarked on a journey of self discovery and what I had discovered was freedom.

I no longer had to try to be something I was not. I no longer had to hold back ideas, emotions, and expressions that were never allowed in my past. I was recognized, complimented, and loved by many people I met along the way. And they loved me for who I really was, not the facade I had tried to put up for most of my life before. I was also blessed with a supportive employer and coworkers who made my transition at work so very easy and an adopted mother who became somewhere I could call home amidst the absence of my birth parents.

I found I was no longer the introverted person that spent so many hours locked away at home living inside a video game but instead, constantly enjoying time and events with friends, acquaintances, and the little bit of family that was supportive. My body began aligning correctly from both the absence of testosterone and the injection of estrogen and my eyes learned how to smile. I experienced dating for the first time and with men to boot! And though it's true that I came across many who either had the wrong intentions or couldn't even begin to comprehend my past, let alone accept it, I also met many men who understood that I was simply a woman.

When the time finally came to have Gender Confirmation Surgery, I was both excited and nervous. The first few months of recovery were difficult for me, more so than the other girls around me. I had my own experience of depression, impatience, and worry in how things were healing. With the help of my surgeon and supportive family doctor, I was able to get through it, another milestone in my life complete. You can't imagine the wonderful feeling it is to finally feel right with your own body in so many ways.

And so I stand before you today, a woman who has experienced a mix of both negative and positive. Did I lose people in my life? Yes. Was there pain involved? Yes. Did I cry my eyes out at times? God yes. But was it worth it? YES!

If you are experiencing gender dysphoric feelings and feel like transition or even life might not be worth it because you'll lose so much or even if you are somewhere in your transition already and still experiencing bouts of dysphoria or having doubts in general, please know: it is indeed worth it. Seek out help, don't give up; there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. "
TransLandGirl,asktransgender,Question for the femme post op folk and anyone else who has had vaginoplasty - dealing with excess vaginal wetness / moisture,"For those of you that have had penile inversion based vaginoplasty, do you get a lot of vaginal wetness, and if you do, how do you deal with it without making your vagina a breeding ground for bacteria? 

A little background on my surgical history... I had penile inversion based vaginoplasty with Dr. Brassard in Quebec in late 2012, followed by a revisional labiaplasty with Dr. Toby Meltzer approximately a year ago in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

Following my first round of surgery, I had some bleeding complications that led to me using pads and pantiliners for a prolonged period of time. I believe that between the prolonged use of pads, the prolonged use of antibiotics out of concern of my initial complications and my body's overall shock to vaginoplasty, I had reoccurent issues with bacterial vaginosis (think consistent fish crotch...eww). 

After it finally cleared up enough, I finally found myself at a point where I felt comfortable embracing my body... that combined with my overall fear of underwear from having to wear 4 pairs of small sized panties to tuck with pre-surgery, I found liberated in my new commando life style... and once the underwear and pads went away, my vagina had a chance to breathe and was finally happy and normal. 

The issue comes in that, as some would see it, I am very fortunate in the fact that my vagina is VERY good at producing natural lubrication and moisture... the downfall being that my vagina is VERY VERY good at producing natural moisture... constantly! 

I have found that whenever I sweat or otherwise experience strenuous activity, and especially in those moments when I become aroused, my crotch is practically consistently soaked... working in the trades, I wear a lot of jeans, dickies and carhartt pants... so moisture plus a lot of moving leads to a LOT of abrasion in a very sensitive area.

 I know that pantiliners are the every day solution to vaginal wetness, but seriously, I am freaked about breeding bacteria... advice would be greatly appreciated"

I was also told that I ""spend too much on my physical transition which gives bad example and unrealistic expectations to other transgender people, especially the young ones"" and ""this is not just my opinion, many people thinks the same. They just too afraid to tell you."" I must add this person was sober and fully aware what they says. 

I left without a word and cried all way home. Do I am really a bad person just because I want to be happy in my life? Because my identity is ""female"" and not ""transgender""? Because I want to pass and blend into society as everyone else does? Because I spent dozens of hours on laser hair removal and electrolysis? Because I work 16 hours per day 6 days per week to make money for my SRS in Thailand and voice surgery in Yeson? 

No, I know I'm not. Today I made a decision and left local trans community forever. I don't want to belong into one group with people whose social norm are gossips, jealousy, lying and stabbing in a back.

[deleted],asktransgender,Any kendoka here?,"Now that I have a job, I'm thinking about taking something like kendo or aikido.

I'm kinda broken physically right now and my muscles don't seem to play nicely with me, but I'd still like to give it a try.

So, any trans kendoka here? What're your experiences with other practitioners (assuming they're aware of your trans status) and whether or not those on HRT (T or E) have any problems with the physicality of it."

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"I'm firmly non-op, but my subconscious is not, and I've been having recurring dreams about agonizing over whether or not to have SRS (NSFW due to talking about genitals)","I'm happy with my factory installed genitals.  I've never had any genital dysphoria about them.  I think they look nice, and they feel good.  If I had a sexual partner, I imagine that I would want to use them with my partner all the time, but I've never been with a partner before, due to social anxiety, body dysmorphia, etc reasons.  I hated how my body looked when I looked like a dude, and was appalled at the prospect of showing my body to anyone.  My body looks fairly andro now, and I'm thinking that maybe after 3 years of HRT or so, I'll be comfortable enough with my body to try having a relationship with someone.  However, the presence of the original factory installed genitals is not a contributing factor to my body dysmorphia.  I know that there are extremely attractive women out there who have penises, and I don't think that detracts from their attractiveness at all.  I think both penises and vaginas are equally attractive, as long as they're on a woman's body, which is the main focus of my attraction.

And yet, I have recurring dreams about me agonizing over whether or not to get SRS.  I had that dream again last night.  So I guess I should analyze my feelings about the matter further.

**Reasons for not wanting SRS:**

*No genital dysphoria

*My current genitals are proven and functional; post-op I might be sexually dysfunctional

*Pre-op (in the case of a US doctor) care: Electrolysis to remove hair on genitals so that you don't have hair growing out of the inside of new genitals.  Post-op care: dilating forever (takes a lot more time in the first year, then just maintenance dilation after first year).  Recovery period immediately post-op.

*SRS is permanent; if I change my mind, I can't turn back the clock and get my old penis back

**Reasons why SRS might be a good idea:**

*Society expects women to have a vagina (not really a good enough reason in my mind)

*Underwear would fit better (also not really a good enough reason in my mind)

*Fewer issues of people seeing a bulge, such as when going swimming

*I'm a lesbian, and women who like women would likely be more attracted to women who have vaginas, rather than penises (also not really a good enough reason in my mind; this is about what I want, not what other people want)

**Other factors:**

*My insurance (Kaiser) completely covers SRS with Dr. Meltzer, and I haven't taken them up on it because I'm fine with the status quo

*If I was to get SRS, I guess I'd probably want Thai SRS, since I hear it's better, but likely wouldn't be covered by Kaiser

*I don't think that I would have genital dysphoria if I had SRS, like I don't have genital dysphoria now.  I'm content to have a penis, but I wish I had been born with Complete AIS, rather than Partial AIS, and women with CAIS have vaginas, not penises, so a vagina would be fine.  So I think I'm agnostic as to what genitals I have, and the main things affecting my decision are inertia and ease of living.  If I had a button that I could push that would instantly and irrevocably give me a cisgender woman's vagina, I might push it (I would have to think on it), and if it was a better button, one that I could push again to give me back the penis, then I would push it immediately, give the vagina a try for a while, see which one fits me better.  If I woke up in a hospital tomorrow and had a vagina, and then a doctor came rushing up to me, said ""Don't sue me, don't sue me, something went wrong and now you have a perfect cisgender woman's vagina, don't worry, we can give you SRS so you have a penis again"", I'd just say no thanks, I'll see if I can manage like this, I'll probably be fine.

So logically, given the pros and cons, I should not get SRS.  I'm good with what I have now and would be risking something that's proven and functional for reasons that aren't good enough to warrant such a major change.  I wish I could tell my subconscious to just shut up and stop rocking the boat, that I've weighed the pros and cons already, and it's not helping matters.

I guess it's good that I set myself this 3 year mandatory waiting period prior to getting an orchi, what with these thoughts intruding in my mind."

So for context, I'm 24, mtf in Oregon. I've been seeing a therapist for about 5 months now and was confirmed for gender dysphoria right around the first month. After a referral to the Kaiser gender clinic i was all cleared for hormones on the basis that my therapist writes a WPATH letter. I assumed this would be an easy process, however, it's 5 weeks later and she hasn't sent them anything! I don't think she's gatekeeping me- every session we talk about my feelings and she fills in questions she's had, all pertaining to certain aspects of my transition, why I'd like to start hormones. She's never written one of these letters though and I feel like she's getting too caught up in the Kaiser guidelines or looking for specifics. 

I guess my question is, what experience have other people had with getting a letter written? How long did it take, did you meet the HRT guidelines, etc. Is this normal? I'd really like to start hormones now so I can continue my therapy while becoming myself :/"

baby-bebop,asktransgender,Closeted trans man low-key losing my mind,"So I'm 22 and two long years away from finishing undergrad (due to a bad accident). Literally AS I WRITE THIS I am procrastinating on an essay for my major, a subject I once thought was my passion but have totally lost interest in. I missed the essay because I had to move out of a predatory renting situation in a new city and it completely fucked up my life. Now I'm so behind on work I don't know if I'll ever catch up. I also missed a ton of job interviews and so I'm 1) low on cash and 2) reluctant to take a job because I have to focus on school first.

I lose my mind when I'm not working. I'm at the age where my life is starting to feel empty without kids, for fuck's sake!! I just want to graduate, get my degree in this meaningless subject and then go back to state school for my MBA. That's all.

I chopped off a significant amount of my hair yesterday, not least because it was so long and tangled I just couldn't take care of it with all these other things going on. I really want to get a short quiff-type haircut, but I have to go to a friend's wedding/see my family at Christmas and they'll KNOW if they see it. I can't be 22, jobless, still in school AND gender-nonconforming! That is the millennial Bingo sheet from hell.

My whole life just feels like an almost comical dumpster fire and I've been repressing who I am for so long that I don't even know if I'll have any interest in being that person when I get to. If I manage to line up a summer internship in the city, I can probably cut my hair after Christmas, but even then that's SO FAR AWAY.

TheTallChick,asktransgender,Catabolic muscle wasting.. diet and routine look good?,"I'm looking to lose lean muscle mass. I lifted in youth, then never again, but never lost my bulk. I'm also MTF. I'm not power lifter level, but I'm not that far removed either. I just have a hard time losing muscle, and I've been on spiro/E for 10 years, so hormones aren't going to do it.

I want a check on diet here. I want to try and get my numbers rightish.

I'm 6'2 and 250lbs. My ideal weight, realistically, is around 200lbs. Per BMI, it's 148-193.

From what I've been reading for the last few weeks, the goal is 8*goalweight@5%protein,95%fats/carbs for a catabolic wasting diet.

If I set a goal of 180lbs which is high end of BMI...   
8x180=1440 calories total to work with.   
The easy one is protein. 5% protein works out as 1440x5%/4 or 18g   

With an even break down, fats and carbs work out as...   
1440x.95/2/4 or 171g of carbs   
1440x.95/2/9 or 76g of fats

The /r/fitness wiki suggests that the actual split between fats and carbs is mostly personal in nature, not really a set in stone thing.

There's also extensive low intensity aerobics, my goal for this is going to be as much time fast paced walking on a treadmill based on time I can realistically allot. On weekends, I hike, so this is only at home stuff on work days. 

I'm planning on adding a small routine of side lunges, hip abductions, sumo walks, and planks to try and reshape my hip area a bit.

Again, yes, I'm trying to lose weight with a focus on muscle mass as primary target. I've got a Michael Clarke Duncan type build, though I'm a a whole race paler, and a bit taller than him when I'm in my small sneaker wedges. My bulk is mostly muscle, with enough fat over the top to round it out thanks to hormones, but the bulk hasn't gone anywhere.

Macronutrient numbers look ok? How about routine plan?

Since it's basically the exact opposite direction most people on that sub go, figured someone here might be more knowledgeable. "

debraMckenz,asktransgender,"7 years: From 'out', to 'stealth', to just being me","When I came out in 2009, I was very open with everyone about who I was and who I was transitioning to. I had a public blog, video logs, a very open Facebook, etc. I kinda felt like I had to because my network had only ever known me as who I was before….and plus I was excited about it. I lived and breathed ‘transition’.

In 2011 when I had vaginoplasty, all of that started to change. I started wanting more privacy. I made a lot of new friends and didn’t tell them right off the bat about my past. I guess something about that surgery seemed final and the couple years I obsessed with transition and did NOTHING ELSE with my life seemed finished. I turned 30 and decided to figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life because surely there was more to it than transition. 

Mind you, I say transition was over but I still put more effort into correcting my body. Between 30 and 35 I had breast augmentation and hair transplants and began researching FFS. But in the meantime, I explored new hobbies, learned new skills, got married, and expanded my career. 

I started basically considering myself ‘stealth’. Therefore, when somebody broke that bubble of happiness by questioning my gender, it was kind of a huge blow. It didn’t happen often; maybe like 5 times over 5 years or so, if that….but it was still frustrating. 

I got to a point where I didn’t tell any friends, even close friends. My best friend of 3 years….I didn’t tell her until I asked her to be my Maid of Honor at my wedding and we had already been close friends for over a year. It wasn’t that I didn’t think my friends wouldn’t be supportive but rather, I just didn’t want it to even be something to talk about. I was done with it and had moved on and I didn’t want to be seen as anything other than a woman. Even supportive friends can see you differently sometimes.

Due to some bathroom laws that have been cropping up over the last year, I got upset enough to post on Facebook about it. It went out to friends but not acquaintances but it was still a huge leap for me to come out all over again like that. Because of the nature of the post, I haven’t gotten a lot of questions so that’s been good but also as kind of expected, there was a lot of support and not a lot of surprise. And that’s led me to believe that rather than me being ‘stealth’……I’ve merely surrounded myself with courteous people who quickly took the cue that I wasn’t going to talk about so they shouldn’t either. 

I’ve taken that Facebook post down now but I’ve been struggling with how to handle it now that I’m kind of ‘out’ again but not really/fully. 

A friend of mine told me her perspective on her own life:

“I just became exhausted caring so much all the time about every possible little male gender cue I might possibly be sending out still. It's never even a topic among my friends. I set that tone. When a new friend finds out, I let them knock out their questions for a bit. Then I make it clear that I dont identify as trans, and don't expect it to be relevant.

local_clbrt,asktransgender,What tracheal shave incision is the best?,"Hi all!
I really want to get a tracheal shave but the only one available in my country is with an incision in one of the folds of the neck, so like right in the front. I've heard about other places making an incision underneath the chin etc. and since I'm worried about scarring, I have to ask - what way is the best? Is there a major difference?

My doctor said there's a 1/10 chance that the scarring ends up bad, and therefore told me to think about it a bit more. I'm sure I want to go through with it, but maybe I should try to do it somewhere else where they don't make the incision on the neck? What would you say?

Thank you!"
uskdyrmtvl3150,asktransgender,Probably cis male but want to be a girl? [Pretty long],"Well, this is my first actual post here, and I don’t intend to be a frequent poster, so here’s a 2100+ word post with no paragraph structure. I’m not sure what I’m looking for, but I guess I want some other people’s thoughts on this.

So I’ve been questioning since sometime in January this year (AMAB). For a long time I’ve found that there are girls that are “annoyingly cute”, at least I think so, I’m not sure at this point, but I was on Facebook when I scrolled past a picture of one such girl, and I thought about how it might be nice to be her and I didn’t really think much of it at the time. It was next month, in January, when I came across a transition timeline on imgur, and I got curious and looked at /r/transtimelines, and I was envious of the young transitioners because they were adorable and looked just like girls, and naturally that raises some questions. Up until this point in my life I had an answer to every problem, but here I only had questions which lead to more questions, and very few answers. On one hand I kind of wanted to be a girl but on the other I didn’t think that I was one, and this is still relevant today, about ten to eleven months later. Before, I didn’t think about gender much and the differences between men and women, of course I knew there were differences but they didn’t consciously occur to me, as if I wasn’t consciously aware that women are smaller and can’t be as strong as men, but now I think about these things all the time; it’s probably rooted deep in my subconscious, something that comes up in every interaction with another human, and something that I usually think about before falling asleep and just after waking up. Whenever I see a man I think about his masculine features and how I would feel if I had them, and same with women; in my first university class I met my instructors and TAs who were both men and women, and I was thinking about one of the men’s broad shoulders and how I probably don’t want to become that, and both of the women and how they’re cute and small and how that must be nice. This is something that happens every day whenever I see anyone, to varying degrees; sometimes it’s not very noticeable and sometimes, especially when I have nothing to be focusing on, I think about it constantly. I’ll think about this all the time in class, how the girl in front of me has such narrow and small shoulders or such perfect long and silky hair, or a small frame and a nice figure with prominent hips, and how I can’t have features like these. I’ve probably been caught staring a few times, like when I was looking at this girl’s knees thinking about how they’re round while mine are square, or how another girl’s cheeks are so round and cute. Up until this point it definitely seems like I’m trans, though I don’t think that’s the case. First of all I don’t hate myself or the way I look, though I definitely wish to be more feminine, in which ways, I’m not entirely sure. I do wish I were trans because then I could actually get to be a girl, something that I seem to envy quite a bit, though I’m not sure it actually works out that way for me. I don’t think it’s a mistake that people befriend those of the same gender, and I’m not sure I relate to women very well, though I don’t talk to many women, in fact, the few women that I talk to actually turned out to be trans men, so that already goes against the idea that I’m trans, but even more so is the fact that I don’t experience phantom limb sensations and the feeling that something is terribly wrong. Even though I would like to have smaller shoulders and be small and have bigger hips and look really girly, I don’t, nor have I ever, to my knowledge, felt that something is wrong with my body, and I think that this is important, because I know trans men who have the urge to cut off their breasts sometimes, and they even experience phantom erections when they don’t have a penis. Hormones could help me achieve what I want to, but they affect every tissue in the body, including my genitals and my brain, and this is a little bit scary as someone who likes having a penis and doesn’t experience this “brain fog” that some trans people talk about. Furthermore I’m conflicted about breasts. I used to think that I definitely didn’t want them, though now I don’t know for sure, as sometimes I think they could be nice to have, but then I worry about how they would actually feel. Right now I can sleep on my chest and I can bring my forearms all the way up to my chest just fine, but things would work a little differently with breasts, and the feeling of actually having something there, taking up space, and having sensation there might be weird. What if they get too big or are too jiggly or just feel bad? Or they might feel good. From my understanding the brain keeps a map of the body and how it thinks it should be, but some conditions such as having the wrong sex can create difficulties due to differences in the two which can’t be reconciled without physical changes. I remember reading an article about someone born with such a condition where they didn’t feel like they should have legs, so they froze their legs and killed the tissue ultimately resulting in amputation, and I’ve read some shit on the /lgbt/ board of 4chan about trans women injecting some chemical to basically destroy one’s testicles, then going to the emergency room to have them removed. I’m sure most everyone here understands the problem of phantom limb sensations, but I’m just re-emphasizing that this is some serious shit and these people are desperate, as freezing one’s own legs off or melting one’s testicles via chemicals are very deliberate and planned. Knowing this, and that I don’t feel like cutting my penis off, or feel that my chest is always compressed, how can I really claim to be a girl? Still, despite this, I have some innate traits that seem consistent with trans people. One time in Chemistry my teacher was talking about types of polymers when he mentioned BPA and how it’s harmful to men and that men are less masculine than they used to be, and my initial thought was “sick, why would you want to be masculine, and where can I get exposure to this BPA stuff?”. I’ve also always felt better playing as girls in video games, and didn’t like playing as men. I don’t like how big and blocky men are, and when playing as a man the character doesn’t feel like my own. I hated playing as the male character in Fallout 1, and didn’t like how big and muscular he was, and I felt better playing the girl. In a lot of games I would subconsciously avoid playing characters that were male, even in GTA online when I made a male character and later on restarted with a female one because he didn’t feel like “my” character. A few years ago someone asked me why I only play female characters in games and I wasn’t sure why either, though I said that it was because they were nicer to look at, though it’s probably actually because it’s nicer to imagine myself as them. After all, men don’t really want to be kind of strangely big and muscular and hairy, they want to be cute girls too, right? Given the choice between being a really attractive man and really attractive woman, everyone would choose to be a woman, right? I feel like it’s the natural option and that I could convince other men to think this way too, though this probably isn’t the case. How does the guy beside me with the huge shoulders and square face not think these things about the girl in front of us too? That seems to say something about me, that maybe I do really think like a girl, but going back to that idea of the brain’s map of the body once again, these thoughts unfortunately don’t trump the fact that I don’t feel dysphoric about my body. Sure, I don’t like my body hair and I shave it all, and I don’t like how my shoulders are kind of big, and my face has some square features, but I don’t hate random erections or hate my penis or feel like my chest is missing something, and that’s inconvenient for me, as I would no doubt push the button if it were guaranteed to not cause me dysphoria. I could just try hormones and see how that goes, right? Well, maybe not, because just like how a trans person can live with dysphoria for extended periods of time before finally doing something about it, what if it wasn’t right for me and I did the same? Erectile dysfunction, potential mental fog and other brain issues, and breasts that may or may not feel wrong would all develop slowly over time, until they have long-lasting or permanent effects. And are these feelings even real, or are they all artificial — just something to think about, to keep me from being bored, or a way to escape from reality, or just because I like girls so much? Or is it an obsession or is it related to a thought process a had when I was younger, where I had a crush on someone and I wanted to like that person more so I told myself that I did really like them, even when it was fading? I don’t know. And another thing, I like girls, so if I were a girl I would also be gay, and I don’t get that feeling that I’m gay that a lot of gay trans people seem to experience even before they know they’re trans, and the chance of being trans and gay is pretty low, and my chances are even lower when considering everything that I’ve written thus far. Another thing — I value the potential to transition successfully even if I don’t ever do it. I told myself that I could transition in the future if I wanted to and I would be pretty if and when I chose to as I convinced myself that I would feminize well, but seeing my shoulders and kind of prominent jaw and somewhat square facial features, I don’t feel like this is the case. I can’t be as small as the girls in my classes, nor can I be as cute as them, or have as nice a figure as them; I’m a few months into 18 years old and I shouldn’t have much growing left to do either, so I also can’t have very feminine hips. But does it even matter? It would be nice to look just like a girl but I don’t know if I could explain to family and friends. I think that most if not all of the people around me would be supportive, though I might also feel like I would be lying to them about who I am. It’s easier to just continue to be who I am now, but is it more truthful? I’m not sure, but I think I know the answer in the back of my mind. Chances are that I’m just a normal cis guy, and I think so too, but tomorrow I’ll go to uni and be envious of the cute girls there, and I’ll obsess over masculine and feminine traits still, and if not tomorrow then the day after, or the day after that; sooner or later it will start again — well, it won’t really stop, even if it seems to for a while, because I’ll still be thinking about it even if I don’t notice, whether it’s caused by an actual gender issue or an obsessive disorder or boredom, or whatever it is. I’ll still pass by a pretty girl or see one in a class somewhere and think to myself that I want to be her.

tl;dr I kind of want to be a girl but don’t think I am one nor think that I can be one

As of writing this I feel as though I can maybe just ignore it and be like other men and not care, as if it’s no longer an issue or that I’m just making it one, but I know it will be an issue again soon enough"

YourFavouritePoem,asktransgender,Book recommendations? (Looking for fiction/fantasy novels that are both gay- and trans-positive),"So I'm trying to get a present for a gay trans guy. 

We're both annoyed by the rarity of novels that feature LGBT themes/characters but aren't all about transitioning or coming out. 

I've gotten lots of recommendations elsewhere about good books with gay characters, but I know from experience that authors who write otherwise great LGB narratives can suddenly put transphobic passages in (""I knew I wasn't straight because I'm not attracted to [certain type of genitalia] "", etc).

Has anyone read some good books that are good with both trans and gay themes? I'm looking for fantasy, sci-fi, historical/mythological sort of novels.

(I know this is a long shot, and it doesn't need to match exactly - a bisexual or nb character would be fab too!) (In the same vein, I'd love to hear about a graphic novel or comic book or short story collection or film.)

Thank you for any suggestions!

•Have been very inactive for about a year, still sitting around my average weight of 210LBS. She suggested I exercise more before I make a choice, because it could be a hormone imbalance. 
•She feels that I'm confusing stress and depression with being transgender, is that possible? 
•I live in the country, and the nearest city that has younger people is 15 minutes away, but I don't feel comfortable around people my age. She suggested I go out more.

CactusExplosionTime,asktransgender,What is the difference between a man wanting to be a real man and potential trans in denial feelings?,"I know I am not transgender but I have a terrible fear of being transgender due to my history.

I was very unhappy with my myself and my life until I started to become a real man and went to the gym. I was your typical awkward out of shape depressed nerd with no friends, no life and no hope with girls. Self confidence didn't even exist and I was such a weak person. I hated my life so much and couldn't go on living it. I desperately wanted more but felt change was not possible until I came across an inspirational video of a young man who managed to change his life.

As I got stronger in the gym so did my confidence and self-esteem, I felt the best I had in my entire life. Lifting heavy , pumping my favorite music and flexing in the mirror.... feeling dominant, powerful and masculine... I loved it. I would imagine myself as a confident successful man in all areas of my life with women admiring my ripped body and men respecting me.

I felt increasingly comfortable in my own skin the muscular I got, it felt like this was the person I was meant to be. Some people say that inside every fat person is a thin person waiting to get out, well I say that inside every skinny nerd is a confident muscular alpha male dying to be created.

Unfortunately I stopped beveling I could ever be this real man inside and out. I started to return to my old self physically and mentally and I hated it. It wasn't long before I started crossdressing again and my sexuality became increasingly AGP, worst of all I was plagued by troubling thoughts of wanting to be a woman.

Fast forward to today and I am trying to get back on track. As soon as I can get my hands on them I am going to take steroids. I think if I succeeded in becoming my ideal man these issues would go away. I felt the happiest in my entire life when I was living as or at least trying to become the end goal alpha male.

throwaway100401,asktransgender,That terrifying moment you realise you no longer have any friends.,"Exactly that. Prior to starting HRT and coming out, I had friends. Not many, but they were good friends and I knew that I had someone to turn to if I was feeling unhappy.

Now however, I'm pretty much alone. My university holidays are coming up, and all of my old friends are either too uncomfortable around me or make me too uncomfortable for us to spend time together. So, for the next three months I'll be pretty much alone. The local support/social groups suck, I doubt that the people I know from university would consider me a friend, and the one person in the world I'm currently interested in probably dislikes me (I'm annoying as hell when I'm around them). 

I dunno, I'm a little frightened. I really don't want to be alone, and right now it looks like I am."

SmurfsAreTasty,asktransgender,Not sure if I did something wrong or not.... Confronting a narcissistic internet troll who just tried to destroy my life tonight.,"Small backstory:

Lived my life in shame and personal hate. Drank/Drugs for years. Woke up and finally couldn't take living a lie anymore. Got therapy and hormones. Worked out and ate better. Started to feel amazing again.

I was picked on extensively through school. I was always timid and just took it. This created a whole host of problems later in life dealing with myself. But ever since coming out Ive had more confidence and just am getting to the point of not caring so much about others opinions or whatever.... This also has an apparent effect on my ability to ""just take it and lay down"".

Now:

So over the past two weeks I really put myself out a bit more and wanted to start meeting people. But we know the online dating world has it's dangers. Id had read stories like mine from others on here, but never expected to be involved in one myself so early on.

I had already met two guys who were really nice, but the majority are all pervs with dick pics. I also had met one guy who seemed okay at first. We flirted and I sent him a few compromising things. 1st big mistake on my part. Admittedly. Then things got a little weird as he started getting more aggressive about me meeting him. I didn't quite feel right so I kinda stalled a bit. We had also started communicating on Kik at this time. This is part of the story.

So then one night I was actually going to go over and because he said I was taking to long and stalling, that he was tired and i missed my chance. Pretty much the way he talked was ""I'm important and the world stops for me, not you."" So after that, I didn't message him again. 

Later after a week he messaged me saying hey. And being my gullible self, I talked to him a bit more. So after having a really bad head cold and not being able to do much on the weekend, he messaged me the next day on Kik to say hi. Well I kind of avoided it because I wasn't feeling good. But logged into a dating app to just see who was on. This login was enough for him apparently. He say that I had logged in and proceeded to message me on the dating app and Kik with the same message of leading him on. He said he had also gained my information from Kik such as my phone number and found my dead name Facebook i use for family til im fully out. 

I then asked him why he had gone to all these lengths and called him creepy and sociopathic, to which he replied he was now emailing people i know to send them videos and pictures of me. 

At this point I froze with fear. I shook all over.... I was infuriated that this could have happened to me! I immediately blamed myself. He just signed off with saying ""You made your bed, now lay in it."" 

But then something happened...... I stopped shaking.... I realized that he didn't have just my info, but being the tech savy person i am, I had a bunch of his too. He'd been careful not to let me know to much, because I later found out his profile pic was false.... He told me he lived on the last house of this street. 3 Miles from me..........

So.... I went to his house to confront him. I rang his doorbell, but no answer, rang again, no answer. I then checked the mail hanging out of the mail box... yep. Definitely him, Someone was also inside watching TV. So I knocked loudly. No answer. Then I went to the window and knocked. No answer. I went back to the window and he finally opened the door. With a rifle.... Yep. He knew exactly who was coming over. Because I told him I had a lot more info than he knew.

So instead of coming out he told me to get off the property. I then told him to come outside and speak like a man ""because you're letting a transgirl make a complete bitch of you."" To which he looked me dead in the eye and said ""Get off my property now!"" ""Im calling the cops!"" To which I said, ""Good, because Im calling them as well."" And heres the funny part. After speaking to the officer, he never had made a call. He was even trying to make it seem as if he was talking to someone on the phone as I yelled through his window, ""You decided to slander me, send things to my family, then smugly just laughed the pure torment of a human being off.... Only mistake was you aren't to smart about hiding your tracks. Especially when they live near you, dumbass.""

Anyway, while he hid in his house I waited on the officer. Who told me he could do really nothing about it unfortunately and said it's sad. But that if I gave him the pictures and he circulated them to friends, its legal, but if he uses them to harm my image in anyway with anyone close to me, then I need a lawyer. But don't go over there. He also asked me.... ""So this guy got your info, threatened you, made all these remarks, and you still went over to his house to confront him?"" (I'm 6'0 and only 155lbs, but life made me rough.) I said, ""Yes. I'm not letting anyone rob me of my happiness ever again or get the better of me if I can do something about it.""

So........stupid yes.....but god damn it felt good to see the look on that pervs face when he answered the door and heard ""It's Morgan"" from the darkness.

edit: grammar

update: Ive contacted just my cousin to see if he received any emails. Hed gotten none. I had to explain kind of what was going on....So .... I just came out to my cousin tonight!!!! Out to everyone but my family basically. So, not everything was super frustrating tonight."
Arduinan,asktransgender,Vaginoplasty Surgery Followup,"I just wanted to share some things I that weren't expected after my surgery in case it might help someone out there.

**Hot flashes.** These didn't happen the 2 weeks I was off HRT before surgery, but started right after.  It REALLY helped to have a small electric fan.

**Swelling pain.** My swelling has been normal according to the doctor, but it hurts a lot and kept me awake nights.  It comes and goes.  Despite oxycodone, the only thing that helps is an instant ice pack (they keep stacks of ice on you after surgery too).  I would add at least 12 to any shopping list and have more at home.

**Breast changes.**  I'm still off HRT (almost 4 weeks now) but since post-op day 6 my chest has been noticeable bigger. A really nice surprise.

**Nerve craziness**  Phantom pains, sensations and numbness happened during the first 8-9 days, now it's slowly changing to sharp zaps of pain now and then. 

**Surgery complication** After anesthesia some of the nerves on one shoulder stopped working.  The doctor says it's a neuropathy and it means I can't lift one arm above my head and it's weak.  They say it should get better eventually.

**Dilation** For me I'm going through two 4.25oz tubes of Surgilube a week, twice what I planned for.  Also you want a good mirror and light.

**Pads** I had stocked up on all sorts of pads but learned quick that pads with wings, ""FlexFoam"" or elastic really irritate.  I like plain pantyliners or generic  pads better especially since my flow has been low.  I've used about 4 a day.

**Hair removal**  I am SO glad I had hair removal done.  The few tiny hairs that hadn't been killed yet are still there after surgery, one is on my outer labia.  Be thorough with that ESPECIALLY on the perenium(?) or you might not like the outcome.

**Bathroom** You might want to add glycerin suppositories, Senokot (or another ""active laxitive"") and another Fleets to your shopping list for the constipation after the hospital.  Colace wasn't enough for me.  

**Fatigue and diet** I was told to double my calorie intake which was actually really hard since I had no appetite (thanks to pain meds) and I had been on liquids/no food for so long. So you want really high calorie/nutrious foods waiting after you're discharged.

Also I wanted to add a note for those going to Dr. McGinn.  She and Kristal are so amazingly talented.  They take their work very seriously.  What I ended up with really amazes me; outer labia, inner labia, clitoral hood with clitoris, ""wetness "" between the inner labia and a depth of 5.5"".  My vulva looks as natural as it can I think, and I don't know how you could improve on it.  To me she is the best."
shonkshonk,asktransgender,Transgender and 'transabled'?,"Okay, I first came across this topic in a JK Rowling novel (or should I say Robert Galbraith novel.) There is a (very small) group of people who have something called Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID). The symptoms are generally wanting to have a limb amputated, or be paralysed or blinded.

In a lot of ways they are very similar to trans people.

*They feel discomfort with their existing body configuration, often from a young age.

*This feeling persists and can worsen throughout life.

*Those people with BIID reject reparative therapy and say the best way to relieve their symptoms is to change their bodies.

*They exist despite being maligned and generally hated (especially and maybe understandably by the involuntarily disabled).

*Doctors 'gatekeep' them in the sense of telling them what to do with their bodies.

*They sometimes resort to dangerous methods of self-treating.


The reason I bring it up is that (like it or not) there are so many parallels to our community. Worse perhaps, I see in comment sections of articles about BIID a lot of people linking them with us and using it to 'disprove' our genders.

I feel (rightly or wrongly) viscerally that it is wrong to support those people with BIID in carrying out their 'transitions' - does that make me a hypocrite?

Id love to hear your opinions, or rebuttals for how we are essentially different from BIID sufferers and deserve to be treated differently. Or not if that's your opinion..."

lyn46,asktransgender,Has anyone on here been diagnosed with Celiac Disease once already on HRT?,"So I've been on HRT for a little over a year at this point. I started experiencing symptoms somewhere in mid-August, and they've only been more and more frequent. I've tested out a few options and figured out that it was gluten that was causing me to feel sick so frequently. I had some blood tests drawn by my GP recently that pointed to Celiac, but the results weren't 100% certain so I'm going for more testing. 

I've *never* had any sort of sensitivity to gluten in my life. I was on IM injections from August of 2015 until mid-July of 2016, when I switched to pills due to the back order. I don't know if this has something to due with the switch and the pills are just affecting my body *much* differently than the injections, but regardless I've never felt like this in my life. "

It doesnt matter what's going on or what time of the day it is, I'm just always annoyed. And the fact I'm in a constant state of annoyance makes me frustrated and it makes me more annoyed.

lotus_butterfly,asktransgender,I might be intersex?,"I went to the doctor after peeing blood and an ultrasound showed I have an underdeveloped uterus and Fallopian tubes. When I asked if it meant I could get pregnant he told me it was a possibility but that because of how underdeveloped it is it might not be possible to carry to term. I'm completely shocked that this wasn't discovered earlier (like idk, during the SRS process) and somewhat disappointed that I still can't get pregnant. I think I'm also going to get my chromosomes tested to see if they give any insight into this.

Edit: I should clarify that originally I had an ultrasound to exhaust possibilities and then afterwards an MRI to confirm"
Transthrowaway4351,asktransgender,Public Bathrooms.,"I'm a trans woman who does not pass but does not look like a guy either. I have not gone out much as myself since I'm terrified of using public bathrooms. After talking with a friend I told her I am attending an event in Seattle soon as myself and asked her if she think people would freak out if I used the women's room. She told me that people would but that it would be ok. This confused me and left me with little confidence that I won't be harassed when I attempt this. 

Has anyone had decent experiences of using the bathroom that corresponds with your gender? It would be nice to hear something positive to help my confidence. Tips are welcomed and thanks for reading."
JackSFletcher,asktransgender,Would like some advice from those with spouses who had them before transitioning. How do you make the transition easier for them and how do you deal with any hangups on sex?,"Hello! So, I am FtM. Came out a while ago, but this is all fairly new for me, trying to learn how to navigate thise new world. I plan to start HRT in about six months and have run across an issue that I need some advice with.

I've been married for about 4 years to a wonderful guy. I didn't know (I mean, I had suspicions, but thought the feelings would go away) I was trans until just recently. He's been *very* supportive throughout all of this and actually was the one who guessed that my issue was with my gender identity. 

Now. He is straight. I am gay. I still very much am attracted to him. He is currently attracted to me. Our marriage is very strong and we love each other.

He is worried though that once I start transitioning and looking more like a guy, that he will lose his attraction to me. I feel terrible about this. I want him to be happy and he wants me to be happy. So, we're in this mode of wanting each other to be happy but neither can really do anything about it. He's seen how much better I've been recently while transitioning and is happy for me. 

But I've also seen how transitioning is causing him issues. He loves my breasts, obviously. I would like them gone and hope to do so within the next couple of years if I get insurance that will do the surgery. 

He said he's willing to help me through transitioning and stay with me during the process, but he's been honest with me and said that he's just...really not sure about afterwards.

We're going to a therapist right now, but I want to come to you guys and see how you as either a spouse of someone who is transitioning or someone who is transitioning let me know how to make this easier on him.

I want him to be happy. I'm fully aware that I might have to let him go. And this hurts a lot. His orientation is just as important as mine. But we really love each other romantically, there are zero issues except for this. I don't see him being open to having sex like I'd want, even though I'm ok with P in V sex, he just has that hangup with the idea of having sex with someone who looks like a guy. 

He also worries about being labeled as a gay couple, because he's not gay. He's already had a few people make fun of him for ""not knowing he was gay"".

So, what do I do? If you guys don't know, how should I approach this with our counseling?

**TLDR:** Marriage is great except for the idea of gay sex. I want husband to be happy, he wants me to be happy. Is there a middle ground we can find?"
penduloscope,asktransgender,Not sure whether transitioning is right for me or not.,"This may seem strange but I can't decide whether I have trans feelings or not. One day I say, yeah I'm definitely trans and then the next I feel like I'm not. For the past few weeks, I've spent a LOT of time researching transgender stuff, trying to make up my mind. While trying to figure myself out, I put together a list of reasons why I feel like I should transition and another list on why I shouldn't.

For:

* The first time I thought about being a girl I thought I was an autogynephile and convinced myself I could never be a girl.
* I've avoided intimate relationships because I'm submissive by nature and there's something really off-putting about being the ""man"" in a relationship.
* I had a dream in which I turned into a girl and I was so disappointed when I woke up.
* I always felt as if I had no idea how to be a boy and often watched my peers to imitate their movements and mannerisms in order to fit in. (although this maybe a normal thing for socially inept teenagers/young adults, I don't know)
* I look androgynous right now but the thought of becoming more masculine as I grow older is unsettling and I fear not transitioning at this age would be a missed opportunity.
* I always disliked masculine things about my body, for example during puberty I remember feeling insecure about having largish feet. (By largish I mean normal sized for a guy) On the other hand, I like how my hands are smaller and more feminine than my peers'. I also feel insecure about my masculine voice, but hey at least it's not that deep for a guy.
* I used to have long hair as a teen and I always enjoyed being misgendered by mistake.
* I often hear guys wishing they looked like some masculine celebrity and I really don't associate with that all.
* In short, in social situations I try to be as feminine as possible (especially in my own mind if that makes any sense), without others noticing.

Against:

* I used to feel dysphoric about things like facial hair and chest width before, but now that I stopped repressing my feelings and I'm trying to figure myself out these thoughts seem to have vanished.
* I feel like if I transition I'll lose my old self that I've grown so accustomed to.
* I can't imagine myself applying makeup or speaking in a feminine voice, even the thought of that makes me feel so awkward.
* Living like this is not so bad, why get into all that trouble for nothing? (Am I just bored of my mundane life?)
* I've been diagnosed with OCD, I may be obsessing over nothing.
* What if I just have a lack of confidence because I'm androgynous looking and become more masculine would make me feel like a man after all?

As for the usual magic button test, I'd definitely say yes to it. Right now, I feel like I could suck it up and be a guy, it's not so bad after all. (although I could feel differently in social situations) On the other hand, like I said, I'm afraid that I'm going to regret it down the road. I feel like I'm stuck here..."

emofucked,asktransgender,Stealth at work dilemma?,"So I recently got a job ish thing working at a bar a few days a week. Obviously I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm mostly if not entirely stealth in daily life where I encounter strangers and not so close acquaintances etc. I haven't really had a job after transitioning before now, so other than my friends who all knew about my past from the beginning, I don't really know how people read me over time. 

The reason I am worried is because I feel like a few people here at work, mostly guys, act kind of weird towards me. Sometimes I feel like they actively avoid even looking at me, and are generally very brief with me when I say hello or whatever, even though they seem much nicer to other people. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, maybe it's just how they are with people they don't know that well, maybe it's because I'm too shy and quiet or whatever... But a part of me thinks it might be because I'm transgender. Like they don't know how to treat me or whatever? I don't know, they just seem super weird around me. Another co worker who is gay and super nice also keeps calling me pretty all the time, and I'm paranoid so keep thinking maybe it's like a ""sympathy compliment"" because I'm trans or something? And a few have talked about trans things with me, but a lot of them are actively involved in fighting for lgbt rights and stuff so I don't know, could just be coincidence. 

Either way, sorry for the stupid paranoid rant. :) my dilemma is that I feel like I want to know what the deal is, does everyone know? I feel like if I ask someone if they know, I'm going to be out anyways if I wasn't. People are bad at keeping secrets, so I'm sure that would find its way out :) is there a way of finding out without outing myself? I mean even if they knew it wouldn't matter. No one here is a bigot, at least not openly, no one would care, they would probably just embrace it. But at the same time I don't really want to be on. I don't want to be ""that person"". I just want to be seen as a normal woman"

I'm non-binary but don't know how well that will fly with co-workers, customers, etc., so I feel I should just pick one or the other. On paper I'm female (albeit with a male legal name), but I don't pass as female very well any more - my voice dropped, I get gendered male about 50% of the time, best I can do is butch lesbian. But I don't consistently pass as male either, or at least I think I don't.

I'm thinking of asking trusted friends for feedback. Maybe just applying to more trans-friendly places as male/non-binary and hoping for the best.

artistichead,asktransgender,I discovered I am trans.,"After 26 years of being in denial, I have finally realised, that I am trans. I have always known, just never admitted to it. A strong, beautiful woman-stuck in a male's body. I am not afraid of the pain or the changes that may happen to me, IF (a big IF) I ever decide to transition. What stops me from transitioning is that I admittedly, am putting my family's feelings ahead of mine. My father will not be able to accept my trans mind. It will destroy him. I am glad he accepted me as a gay man when I came out a couple of years ago. I thought that will change my life for better, but there's always a constant nagging that never subsides. I wish society was evolved enough, I wish I was strong enough to defy everything and come out as a woman. I know, in the process of 'not transitioning', I am being horrible and disrespectful to my own self but like I have learnt in the past few years, life is not black and white. It comes in shades of grey. I am giving up the chance of being a happy woman but accepting the body I have been assigned at birth. I let myself down more than anything.

Eve-Stirwin,asktransgender,"Trans, Nonbinary, or just really salty?","First off, I realize that ""Am I trans"" is most likely an exasperatingly common question around here, but I would really appreciate it if anybody feels inclined to weigh in on this. Basically, my issue is that I tend to feel very unhappy with my gender, but don't really have much in the way of physical dysphoria to go with it. Additionally, there are a number of other reasons other than gender identity why I may feel the way I do. Overall, I would say that my biggest issue is feeling comfortable and fitting in with other guys, and I feel a lot better around girls and women, even though my interests are fairly evenly split between genders. In no particular order, here are some thoughts...

* I am 18, AMAB, currently home on medical leave after briefly attending college.

* I don't like a lot of stereotypically masculine things, like sports and drinking and such, but I do like some things like Dungeons and Dragons

* I like creative writing and theater, but I don't really have any *really* feminine interests, like in terms of fashion and physical appearance and such.

* I went to an all male Catholic high school. Prior to that, I was homeschooled, and I was active in Boy Scouts. The end result of this is that for much of my life, I have had *very little* interaction with girls (other than my younger sister)

* I made no close friends for the four years I attended that high school - the few friends I did make were mostly female and were from activities outside of school such as creative writing classes and volunteer work.

* I typically feel very uncomfortable around large groups of guys my age or older - moreso if I'm already anxious or stressed.

* During the brief time I was at college, it felt *really nice* being in a predominantly-female social group. I really liked being accepted by them.

* At my high school, interacting with girls through dances or extracurricular activities was treated as a privilege. I can't help but wonder if that has shaped my attitudes, and I always feel horribly selfish whenever I want to be around girls or women instead of guys.

* The thought of transferring to a predominantly male tech school (which I'm going to do because they have much better support for autism spectrum students) is really, really frightening.

* I still feel horrible over never being invited to my female friends' sleepovers. I sometimes feel like the fact that I'm male makes me disgusting and threatening, and that I deserved to be left out.

* I often feel suicidal over the fact that it will always be harder for me to be accepted into female social groups and activities than somebody who was born female. Then again, I often feel suicidal about a lot of things, so I'm not sure how significant that is.

* On a related note, I guess on some level I *want* to be trans or nonbinary or whatever, not because I'm *at all* sure that that accurately describes me, but because everything in my life feels so horrible and messed up, and I want something that I can point to and say ""this is why.""

* Does the fact that I'm on the autism spectrum make me more likely to have social issues regarding gender without actually being trans? More likely to be trans without realizing it? Neither?
* I had some discomfort with masculine physical characteristics around puberty (increased body/facial hair, etc), though I've since more or less gotten used to them.

* I have no particular desire to dress in a more feminine way, though I don't think I'd really mind it either, aside from apprehension over what other people are likely to think of me.

* The one thing about my body that I *am* still sometimes uncomfortable/unhappy with is my genitals, though I don't really think having something different would be much better. Honestly, that might be more due to the fact that I'm fairly sex-averse and (maybe?) asexual (gray-asexual? I don't know.) Also, I tend to be kind of squeamish about body-related things, and I can't help but be aware of how structurally unsound male genitalia are and how easily they can be crushed or otherwise injured. Plus, they're sometimes uncomfortable.

* Furthermore, I tend to be really afraid and uncomfortable with the idea of somebody seeing me visibly aroused, and sometimes wish I were a girl so that that wouldn't be as much of an issue.

* Also, in regards to the asexual thing, I sometimes wonder if me questioning my gender identity is just because I want to feel more like I belong in LGBT spaces. I was in a group at college, and they were really nice and supportive, but I still can't help but feel like, as a cisgender, hetero-*something* (sexual? romantic?) person, I was kind of on the peripheral of that. Which is fine, I guess, if I don't really belong there. I just have a lot of issues and really need a group of nice, supportive people.

* Additionally, I consider feminism pretty important to me, largely because consent-based sexual ethics is *so* much better than all the shit I got at an all-male Catholic school. However, reading feminist blogs and such tends to reinforce the guilt and self-hatred I have for myself as a male person. Is my gender questioning really just a way for me to escape from that guilt, avoid responsibility, and force my way into spaces and discussions that belong to women?

* Alternately, does the fact that being criticized for my gender makes me feel so much self-loathing indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with it?

* I guess I've already kind of mentioned that I feel more happy and comfortably and less threatened around girls/women than guys. Is that okay, or am I just being horrible and stereotypical?

* The fact that I'm attracted to female people makes me feel like any attempt to fit in with them is just going to be weird and creepy. I think part of the issue is that there's just so much overlap between what I find appealing in a friendship and in a romantic relationship. On the one hand, I'm really pretty uncomfortable with sex, and thus feel like my relationships might look more like friendships. On the other hand, I often want my (close) friendships to be more like romantic relationships. I really like (and am desperate for) physical contact, but feel guilty for wanting to cuddle with people, let alone being aroused by them.

* Furthermore, because cuddling with people is important to me and because I never really feel comfortable enough around guys to want to do that with them, I'm left wondering whether I'm a horrible person who is only really capable of friendship with people who, on some level, I'm attracted to.

* I think lesbian relationships look really, really nice, and hate that (I feel like) as a male person attracted to women, no relationship that I could have would have the same level of balance and mutual understanding. Even if somebody were to find my male body attractive, I wouldn't feel good about it or understand why, and I would wish that I had a more feminine body so that they could find me attractive the same way I would find them attractive.

* Then again, most of my friends are lesbian or bisexual girls, so... I don't know. Maybe I'm biased?

* To be clear, I feel this way more in regards to romantic relationships than in regards to having sex with people. To be honest, my knowledge of what lesbian sex actually entails is embarrassingly non-existent, but I'm kind of afraid to investigate due to how incredibly uncomfortable I am with genitals and bodily fluids and stuff in general. Still, it can hardly be *worse* than heterosexual sex...

* At any rate, I feel like I'm always going to feel unattractive and predatory in an opposite-gender relationship, regardless of whether or not that's actually the case. Sometimes, I wish I were attracted to men as a solution to that, but not as often as I wish I were a woman.

* I've been especially obsessive about physical contact since I broke up with somebody. Which happened a few months ago. But hey, I'm *really* not in a great place right now to get over it, being alone all day at my grandma's house.

* I don't know if this is all due to the fact that the girl I broke up with isn't really comfortable with physical contact with guys, and generally likes girls more. Certainly, my feelings on the matter have been stronger since breaking up with her and feeling unwanted and unwelcome due to my gender, but I'm pretty sure I felt that way well beforehand as well.

* At any rate, I'm definitely unhappy with masculinity, both my own and just in general. Often, I wish that everyone was genderless, or maybe female.

In conclusion, I guess my question is really whether or not these traits are suggestive of anything, gender-identity-wise, given my lack of substantial physical dysphoria and the counter-arguments I mentioned. On some level, I *want* it all to mean something just so I can finally have some idea what's wrong with me, but I don't know if that's really it. Maybe I'm just a really entitled guy who feels like he's too good for his own gender...
At any rate, I really appreciate any thoughts you might have."

JRSlayerOfRajang,asktransgender,Grandma's dying. Should I tell her about me?,"Long story.

Last year one of my grandparents got really sick. She'd been very ill for a long time and my parents had hidden that from me. When I eventually learned she only had a few months left, I felt like I hadn't had a chance to do enough with her, and so on. She died while I was away, I never had a chance to say goodbye. I told my parents never to do that again.

Today I found out my last grandparent, my grandma, is also dying. She got an injury almost three months ago, it's not healing and it's severely infected. Three courses of antibiotics, and nothing. She's being transferred to a specialist, but best case scenario is she loses the leg.

I found out yesterday, from my grandma herself. She sent me a card wishing me luck for the start of term, and mentioned that she was sick, assuming my parents had told me. They hadn't.

So I called my parents, and said a lot of things I probably shouldn't have.

What makes all this worse, is that they haven't let me tell grandma I'm trans in the past, and are refusing to now. She'd totally be accepting, I know it, they know it, but for some reason they won't let me tell her.

Since she's now been moved into a hospital, I won't be able to reach her by phone, or write to her, or visit her on my own. They're not telling me where she is.

The only way they'll let me see her is if I present male, use my deadname, and tell her nothing. They want her to die without even fucking knowing my name, even though she's totally LGBT supportive and has a trans friend who she supported when she was trying to transition in the 70s!

I don't know whether I should go along with it and feel horrible and guilty and ashamed, pretend to go along with it and tell her and risk destroying what's left of my relationship with my biological parents (I'm not calling them family), or try to fight them on this. And all the while I don't know what's happening with her or how long she has left. But I depend on my parents completely, without them I wouldn't be able to stay at uni since they cover the cost my accommodation that the loan doesn't. I'd have to drop out, and would wind up on the streets.

I don't know what to do.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation?"
kernalmustache,asktransgender,[NSFW] Advice for Tucking,"[Buzzfeed posted an article about tucking earlier this year.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/meredithtalusan/all-the-questions-you-had-about-tucking-but-were-afraid-to-a?utm_term=.igD8lX0zyD#.cudQD174xa) I see a lot of people ask for advice on tucking and I think this could be very helpful.

This article actually gave me what I think is a very good, but kind of complicated idea. Basically, it's an idea for [a sleeve](http://imgur.com/sENJs7h) with some straps on it. The main reason I'm posting this is because I wanted to share the article, but then I thought I might as well share this as well in case any of you are crafty and own a sewing machine and find this idea preferable to how people usually do it. Why I thought of this is because I think it would solve the problem of not being able to pee with the taping method, the problem of not being able to get everything flat enough with the regular gaffe method, and the problem with sweating too much which can happen either way.

I'm going to try to explain this, but it is very late and I'm a bit tired so I linked an image above to try to help with this. It has very quick sketches I made in paint and text labels so hopefully you can understand what I mean.

What you're going to do first is take a piece of cloth (something soft but durable) and you're going to want to cut and sew it into the shape in the top left corner of the image. It should be like a dick sleeve with straps. I recommend putting some fabric in the sleeve so that the penis and scrotum are not touching each other all day. That long skin-on-skin contact can cause rashes when things get all warm and sweaty down there. If the fabric you chose to make the sleeve out of is not stretchy then you're going to want to use something elastic (such as a rubber band or hair tie, but make sure that it's not so tight that it will cut off circulation) and you're going to sew it into the end of the sleeve where your genitals will be going in. This should allow your genitals to not slide out of the sleeve while being pulled back in much the same way your penis would be if you taped it back. It should also be more comfortable, easier to keep your scrotum in place, and it should not be at increased risk of getting a sweat rash.

The other part of this, the straps at the end, can be done one of two ways. The first way would be to leave them as just straps and to tape them to the back of your thighs. I'm not a fan of this because then if you went to the bathroom it would just be hanging there and it would probably get wet, but it would be more discreet and would take less sewing. The other way to do it would be to get some kind of stretchy fabric (I would cut up a pair of panty hose) and to sew it to the straps so as to create leg holes. If you want to use just the tops of a pair of panty hose it would probably hold better, but you would have to buy a lot more panty hose."
AngstyCanadianTeen,asktransgender,What now?,"So I came out to my parents in August (28th I think) and the next day went to my family doctor to see about finding a theripist for me.

At this point I don't really know what to do. I don't know if I should call and ask about it or not.

I felt a bit better/happier after coming out but I've gone right back to being depressed and mostly keeping to myself at home like I was before coming out. I've started cutting again and would probably be thinking about suicide again if I didn't have my girlfriend.

Restarting transition again at 31, after an aborted attempt back in 2011-2013 when I was 26, and one of the big things that stopped me originally was that, after really looking forward to losing my beard, the laser and IPL just didn't seem to work. Without that I didn't feel much confidence in presenting as female. (I'd kind of accepted I wouldn't necessarily pass, due to bone structure and skin, but it felt like having stubble or a beard and presenting as female would leave me feeling I had no dignity at all, and transition just felt pointless.)

Background: After 3 years of treatment, sessions about every month, I still had to shave basically daily not to have stubble and didn't noticeably feel that I was having any progress.  I didn't ever really get a great answer out of any of the (really nice) laser technicians at the two places I went, one with lots of experience of transwomen, about why it didn't seem to work for me. I was always told me I was an ideal candidate because of my very light skin and very dark hair and they ran the laser at the highest settings my pain tolerance could take, and I definitely always smelt burning hair and felt the laser. I've had a lot more beard (and body :( ) hair grow since, because I was just so discouraged I stopped visiting my doc and keeping on my HRT. I still feel like the basically typical beard I have now should have had *some* impact from the laser.

So yeah, just basically wondering if anyone else had any issues like this, where you've had like 36 or so laser treatments on their whole beard, and still had had a noticeable beard and needed to shave. Like, for some of us, are our follicles just so ridiculously resilient and recover from the laser really quickly? Is there any science about how get the best out of laser, or why it might not work and anything I'm not doing?

Really because after starting HRT again, I've been procrastinating on whether I should drop yet more cash ad time on laser, or if my only option is to go electro (which the insane time and cost has always totally put me off), or that if the laser just doesn't work to this degree, I just have to accept that I'll always have to shave at least daily and have a 5 o clock shadow."
realconfusedrn,asktransgender,"I'm really confused at the moment, can I just vent for a sec?","So I was AMAB, but ever since I can remember I've always had a desire to crossdress. I always just thought it was a weird little quirk, and there was no chance that I actually wanted to be a girl. 

So anyway about two weeks ago, I had a bit of cash spare and thought fuck it, might as well give it a go. I actually tried crossdressing for the first time, I ordered a bunch of makeup and some other stuff from Amazon and fuck, I felt amazing. I didn't look good, hell I didn't even look like a girl but I *felt* amazing. I got ""dressed up"" twice before I got scared and threw it all in the trash, getting paranoid about someone finding it. 

Now, every time I look in the mirror, I feel shitty because I see a dude looking back at me. Somehow, I feel worse seeing an average looking dude in the mirror than when I saw a ""girl"" with day-one makeup skills, a beard shadow and some ill-fitting clothes. I can't even pretend to understand, it's like, three weeks ago I was perfectly happy being a guy, and now I'm not. Is it even possible I tricked myself into thinking I'm happy being a guy for this long? It just feels like a switch has been flipped and suddenly nothing makes sense any more.

I've been debating ordering some more makeup and clothes ever since I threw away the first set, but I'm scared. If I get spooked and throw it all away again that's even more money down the drain. I honestly don't want to have to confront the fact I might be transgender. Three weeks ago everything was fine now my brain feels like mush. I can't focus on my schoolwork, I can't focus on anything without my mind drifting to this.

So that's it I suppose. I already feel a little better after putting all of this into words. Reading some other posts on this subreddit helps as well, it makes me feel like I'm not the only one going through this. Feel free to share your stories or problems in the comments I guess! "

MissGwendolyn,asktransgender,Buying feminine products pre-transition,"Hi! I have a small, kind of silly problem that I was hoping somebody could give me some advice on. 

I have pretty bad anxiety and social anxiety. I really, really want to go out and buy a variety of things, like makeup and cocoa butter and all that kind of stuffs. 

However, I'm currently 100% pre-transition, and therefore present completely male. Additionally, I still live with my parents. It's a relatively small town, and there is a chance of me being recognized if I decide to go to the supermarket and buy these things. I would buy them online, but I'm afraid of my parents seeing the package before I do.

I know that I should just go out and buy stuff anyway, but I really can't get over the anxiety. Any suggestions would be welcome; if it's a way to get over the anxiety, that's fine, or if it's a good idea on how to be sneaky about getting this stuff, that's also fine.

Laser_Lens_4,asktransgender,I've had a lot of time to think things over and I've come to my own personal conclusion...,"Gender fucking sucks.




Okay, so this is mostly just a vent. I don't have very many people I can talk to about this. I came here a while ago asking questions about being trans and taking hormones. I even made a friend, but since then I've had lots of stuff happen, the most severe being a retinal detachment that I'm still recovering from. One thing it did (besides destroy my life for the next 2 months) was give me a lot of time to think and reflect.




Everything that's happened, both in the world and to me personally has really made me resent genders altogether. I don't think of myself or others as male or female, just as people. That said I still acknowledge gender out of respect for others, but I myself don't care for it.




I wondered if any of you found, or find, yourselves in a similar situation. Maybe it's just me being clever about giving up. I dunno but for now that's how I feel, and I don't see that changing for a good long while."

DavidDedalus,asktransgender,How did your first month go? Does it really get better?,"I see a lot of posts about destransitioning or suicide and while I'm gratefully nowhere near that bad I feel like my first month on HRT hasn't changed much?

I was just wondering how other peoples first month's went. Did you notice much in your first month? Physically I wasn't expecting much and while there are some slight changes I'm not bothered its not instant but I expected more mental changes. Maybe its not something you can notice from your own perspective?

I was initially elated by getting to start HRT but it became normal about a week in, had one great fullbody orgasm before my libido died (which I know is normal) had a fight where I couldn't get let go and got told i was PMSing (which actually made me happy) and noticed I'm a little more outspoken but not much happier on the whole and I have slightly more energy.

I'm now questioning if there's more than HRT to treating dysphoria? Do you think that you need to transition outwardly to really feel better? I'm just curious about others experiences focusing on your inital mental changes? I've just having weird doubts now about my trans-ness that I do try to shut down (there's really no way I'm not and I'm not going back to that sad place again) but its just seems to be moving slowly.

THROWAWAY-u_u,asktransgender,"How do you feel about ""gendered language""?","After musing about these two^[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/572bmo/gendered_language_at_a_university/) ^[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/58dmte/this_bot_exists/) posts for a bit, I figured I'd go ahead and ask this question to y'all.

How do you feel about promoting gender-neutral language?

I'm curious because I'm usually aligning with the anti-""SJW"" movement (which yeah, means I frequent TiA a lot.) And, well, I'm also trans. (Okay, well, I'm young and in the closet so I've yet to be medically diagnosed... But I'm pretty sure.)

And I do agree with ""gendered language"" being stupid. Not just ethically—like, ""I don't think we should be policing this stuff; freedom of speech""—but personally as well.

I know that if I transition shit will be rough for the first number of months. I'll be calling myself a girl but I'll look like a dude and be ""mistaken"" for a dude. I'll be uncomfortable and things will be quite a bit lame as I try my best to transition and conform better to the mental image of myself I have in my head. (Which is the argument *for* ""gender-neutral language."")

But... After all of that... I want my work to pay off. If I spend my time, effort, and money on hormone therapy and surgery, voice training, make-up, and new clothes I don't want to be called by ""gender-neutral"" pronouns to avoid offending me. I want to be ""mistaken"" for a girl.

So by my own logic, trans people should find the policing of ""gendered language"" stupid... But, you know, what do the rest of y'all think? I'm I just Uncle Tomming it up or what?"
niku_j97,asktransgender,We raised you and we know you can't possibly be transgender.,"I just had a little chat with my mother on this hotted topic about me not being sure about my gender. I'm Indian (19), currently studying and living in India and I've a very stereotypical orthodox parents. 
So while I was telling her that what I'm going through is natural (God made me this way) and I know for sure it's not induced and I'm damn sure I'm not imagining things. Long story short : she thinks either some Black Magic is involved or internet ruined me. In reply to this she started telling me about this article about some guy who thought he was different but a psychiatrist proved him wrong and he was a normal man and is now married to a woman and living a beautiful life. (I suspect she is making that up). What she said next kind of made me cry but I controlled my tears in front of her.
She said she raised me in family environment and no one suspected you are different in any way. You were a normal boy, no feminine habits or activities. So you can never be a woman or rather don't deserve to be a woman. I agree with what she says about my childhood, I don't remember much I wasn't feminine at all. I started cross-dressing at 10 or 11 maybe and things started to change slowly yet hidden from everyone. I was growing uncomfortable day by day till I told my parents on my 18th birthday.

beautyinburningstars,asktransgender,[NSFW] I'm thinking about camming to save money for surgery. Good or bad idea? Also I have some questions.,"I am recently unemployed living in a town where there are not many jobs available unless you have a degree. I'm in my early 20's and have yet to complete my degree due to trans-related and anxiety/depression issues. I do plan on going back to college as soon as I get GCS, and eventually I'll get my master's degree, but in the meantime, surgery is my number one priority. My dysphoria related to not having surgery has been quickly getting worse over the 3+ years since I transitioned and has become unbearable and crippling. Basically, I feel like I'm going to snap if I don't get it by (at most) 2 years from now. I am looking for a real world job now, but I have heard good things about making fast money being a camgirl online and have a few questions about doing that kind of work. If I end up camming (while working a vanilla job too), I plan to stop as soon as I have the money to pay for surgery. 

1. I actually already had my account approved by one of the bigger camming sites recently, but have not had a show yet. I registered as trans, but I have no intention of showing that thing between my legs to anyone, ever. Would that lessen my earning potential or be a problem in some other way?

2. I pass, so would it be better (in terms of earning potential) to register to a site as cis and exclude below-the-waist nudity in shows? Most sites require a driver's license as proof of age, and in my state, I can't get the M changed to F until surgery, so would the sites catch that detail if I tried to register as cis?  

3. Are the customers for MTF camgirls respectful or do they use slurs a lot? That would be super annoying/offensive, so I would like to avoid that as much as possible.

4. Could the 1099 tax records out me in the future to employers or other people? I want to go deep stealth after surgery, and I don't want anything available to out me as trans. I know people will inevitably screencap or record shows, so I will probably try to disguise myself a bit, at least just in case a video is found by someone I know.

5. If I cam as trans, will that show up differently on tax records than camming as cis?

6. I plan to eventually become a self employed (private practice) LPC, so could camming affect my path to that career or could it affect my chances of getting accepted into a graduate program?

7. Is it easy to hide this line of work from friends/family/coworkers/employers? What are good ways to hide it?

8. Is there anything I am not considering that I should be considering?

9. Is this a dumb idea?

Neosquid,asktransgender,Friends that are borderline transphobic,"What I mean is like friends that aren't outright transphobes, and may refer to you correctly and stuff, but you can totally feel the transphobia radiating from them. One of my best internet friends is like this (doesn't help that I'm basically in love with him...) and it gets to me sometimes. Like, I asked him if he'd tell me if he thought I was cute after my transition, and his response was that he'd consider it a miracle if he found me cute afterwards. I had to tell him straight up to stop making jokes about me being ugly (I never even looked very masculine at all...). He also says that he'll never be sexually attracted to me, which I guess is the thinking of many straight cis guys but it's depressing nonetheless. 

I have an irl friend (who I'm not hanging out with atm due to dysphoria) that is better than anyone else on this list and I for the most part can't fault him, but still says some aggravating things. He said he couldn't take me seriously after I made some comment mentioning cis people, treating the word like it was just some sort of tumblr meme. When I asked if I was just supposed to call cis people ""normal people"" he said yes, apparently completely oblivious to how offensive that sounds. 

Then there is my cousin, who being the only person in my family who actually remotely understands how being transgender works (as far as I know so far), I hoped would be more supportive of me. But no, his response was to take me out in his car and basically made me feel like a joke. Shit like how he'd ""bet money I wasn't trans"" and that ""I was imagining things"", and used the phrase ""just because you kind of want to be a girl"". The entire argument was that I didn't dress up in girl clothing when I was younger. He made me feel like shit and it still bothers me sometimes. It's been months since he did that and I'd hope he had changed his mind, so I explained how it made me feel and asked if he'd ever apologize. He refused. 

My step sister is probably the worst offender. She nags me about all the privilege I have as a ""white guy"", used a laughing emoticon after the only time she referred to me by my name, and dismissed my attempts to explain how this works to her with ""science isn't always right"". She in particular is one I could go on more about, but this is the gist of it. Fuck her. 

I mention this particular cousin and step sister cause we're more like friends than family, though it's hard to really consider them that atm with how upset I am with them...yeah, idk, I just wanted to get this out there. I'm sure most people here have friends that are like this, how do you deal with them?

my story isnt all that new. since i was young i wanted to be a girl, i like to dress in women' clothing and likes feminine things, but i never had much of dysphoria (except occasional dislike towards my male body). being a woman is much much more appealing to me than being a man. which is why i started HRT as soon as i find out that im a trans.

now within the first week of my hrt &amp; off my antidepressant i begin to notice new things. im starting to wonder what gender i fall into. but lets be clear here i know i falls into the feminine side. i dont like masculinity at all, and doesnt want to present masculinely. 

here are a list of things that make me damn confused about my situtation �� 

1. i never had a big issue living as a guy, but i also didnt like living as a guy.

2. i never had too much dysphoria that would cause a breakdown but at the sametime i dont like my male body/sex orgen/facial hair.

3. i dont mind myself or others to refer me as him/he while i feel weird to refer myself as she/her (i blame on all the years living as a male &amp; my looks! ��)but at the sametime doesnt mind others to refer me as she/her.

4. sometimes i really like how i look in the mirror with female clothing, while other times it may make me depressed or disgusted (i blame it on my male look and body again ��)

5. i love the androgyny(soft butch)/female/male fashion and doesnt mind to wear androgyny(soft butch)/female/male clothing as long as i dont look too masculine.

6. i have a cheerful personility but i feel that being cheerful and cute is only reserved for girls or androgynous people. and feels extremely weird to be myself when presenting as a male.

7. i dont think i'll mind to continue to live as a guy, but living as a girl sounds so much better...

so... anyone know what i am? i think i pretty much established that i am trans. but am i bigender? gender fluid? or some other genderish stuff...

 o.... what do everyone think?please~ help~~~ ��

Something didn't feel right so I looked up all the information on referrals and also the referral form itself from the NHS. Its 6 pages of blank space with questions and information requirements to be filled in by the doctor and sent with medical info. He asked me none of the questions on the paper and didn't even do any kind of examination which the paper says was required for referral. I feel super super mad about this because I feel he either got it wrong in ignorance or intentionally ignored a real referral.

Im down there soon for some tests and I intend to bring it up and possibly book a different doctor but I needed to really vent on this. Wait times are long enough with this.

Side note:

Im having serious problems with the wait. Its been only two weeks since (atleast I thought) the referral was sent and if it was its a poor one with no information on how much its effecting me at all so they will probably put it right to the back of the pile because he didn't write anything down! anyway I don't think I can take another 2 years of waiting just to start hormones. I waited 25 years I already feel too old, it scares me and I'd rather die than begin transitioning too late for me personally, its a big big deal. Every day im struggling with my emotions just flying all over the place I feel crushing sadness in my chest I can't just stop this, keep pretending for 2 years and I do not want to try to pass now I need to be comfortable before I do it.

I hate to say it because I know its not their fault but I hate the idea of kids at 18 constantly beating me to it. By the times they've fully transitioned they'll still have 4 years or so just to catch up to my age where they can live as themselves. All im doing is getting older and older as something im not its terrible. I just don't know."
PossibleMTF1,asktransgender,I hate my extreme AGP and don't know what to do?,"(Cis male 20) My sexuality only consists of being aroused to being a girl in sex or otherwise. I can't get aroused simply by others and only by this phenomenon which is best described by AGP. I have heard others w/ a similar experience haven't been able to perform and orgasm during sex. Due to this condition I don't have much interest in sex as a guy, and even if I do I'm scared I wouldn't be able to perform (I'm a virgin). This makes me terrified that I'll never have either a lasting relationship or a sex life, to the point I just want to give up on the possibility and stop worrying about it. This is a huge aspect of life I don't want to miss out on due to some fucked up sexuality of mine, what can I do about this??

whatname2pick,asktransgender,"MTF HRT breast growth happening really fast, advice?","-
-
skip this intro if you want.

Finally stopped pretending everything was fine and took the plunge to start HRT. I was lucky to take the fast track within the system and got my first rx in less than a month. not like i hadn't been going over everything for 6+ years already, so i was thrilled.


now the question
- 124 mtf

- started hormones sept. 23. it's now oct. 6 (2 weeks)

- 1mg estrogen, 50mg spironolactone

- started a bit below an A cup, but standard male shape, whatnot, to within 2 weeks having full size A cups that point about straight forward and are definitely feminine in their appearance, and seem to be getting noticeably bigger by the week so far.

Reminds me of how a friend got on T and, his words, it hit him like a truck.

anyone have any similar experiences? maybe some advice? i was expecting to have another couple months to prepare for this, instead i bought my first bra 5 days ago

Ruby_mtf,asktransgender,Did anyone else feel dysphoria until they accepted themselves?,"I've always identified as a boy, but I hated my wide hips and just hourglass body. It wasn't OK for a guy to have such soft small hands and feminine traits. I have a very round face I even have breast. I'm still hairy as fuck. But now that I started crossdressing and found that women clothes fit me better and I like the way they feel. 

I've always wanted to wear skirts and panties but it wasn't appropriate or accepted. Now that I said fuck it I feel so much better about my body. I like being a dude but I honestly feel bigendered. If I had to choose one change it would be female. But I don't  have to choose I can do both. 

So I guess the question is did anyone else who was mtf body not match your assigned gender identity but once you changed it, it made everything better? "
helpamidoinitrite,asktransgender,Breast Growth help?,"hi asktg

I Have been on HRT now for almost 2 years and my breast growth has really been lacking. Like, im not even an A cup yet, probably more AA on one side and almost nil on the other. Whats going on? My levels have been mostly fine, I was smoking for a while but haven't smoked cigarettes now for 3 months, I do smoke joints though. im 24 now started HRT at 22. Does this mean i'm not going to get any development now? Its really upsetting me that this might be all im going to get. They also seem to Have got smaller than they where a year ago, but I have put on weight in the last year slowly? Shouldn't they be bigger?

Anyone in a similar situation or been in such a situation in the past?

EmiBuns,asktransgender,Suddenly moved to Texas into home of S/O's transphobic parent - Need help with several things,"Okay so long story short I lived in MS, things went horribly bad and I had to urgently and suddenly move to Wichita Falls, TX. I'm 18 (mtf) and I've been on HRT for almost 9 months so I'm mostly perceived as female and so we just let them believe I'm a cis girl. 

Okay so the issue lies in several areas. I still need to get my license and I never got it in MS. I need proofs of residence though and I can't have legal documents or government mail sent here since I haven't legally changed my name yet. I don't know how to go about doing that without that lingering threat of her parents finding out or at least being suspicious. I'd just legally get my name changed too but I don't know how to go about doing that either since I just moved here and I'd assume they'd also want proof of residency for that too. I guess the things I need help or at least advice with are:

A.) Getting a license and the proof of residency for it

B.) The process of legally changing my name even though I just suddenly moved here and again haven't established I guess ""legally recognized"" residence

I'm sorry for any trouble or inconvenience I'm just crushed under this pressure and my severely mentally ill ass being unable to handle this overload of things by myself without having a breakdown. I'd also like to say I'm aware this isn't like some legal help forum, but I'm sure others have been in similar situations so I at least wanted to try and I'm most comfortable asking the help of other trans people.

(Also I'd like to emphasize that the ""threat"" of them finding out could very easily lead to me being emotionally abused or kicked out and in 700 miles from anyone I know)"
cursed_heart21,asktransgender,How do you deal with Internalised Transphobia?,"Hello all, I am very happy to be at the point that I am at but i feel like there is one more final mental block stopping me from enjoying this as much as I'd hope.

I really haven't done myself any favours especially since I always tend to go to ""gender critical"" and read their stuff and become depressed or seek out transphobic stuff which just makes me lose faith in everything and it makes me think i could never be a girl and that HRT and Surgery will just end in disaster and that I'll regret it... 

One such site is Walt Heyer's site which contains some real examples of regret and i don't want that to happen to me because i truly want to be a girl and live the rest of my life as a girl.

I feel like I am purposefully torturing myself with transphobia and negative attitudes towards the results of my transition when I should be happy and should be rejoicing about the fact I am about to transition, but I just feel like I can't ever be a girl and that I should just live miserably as a man for the rest of my life and just blame my dysphoria on stereotypes and society...

This has all led me to believe that I don't deserve to be happy and that i can't ever be myself, I wish I could stop doing this to myself because its making me anxious and depressed."
dizzy_hazelnut,asktransgender,Unsure about Estradiol levels. No effects from HRT so far.,"Hello everyone.
This board is pretty awesome, I've been reading here 
for a while, but it's the first time I post...that shy... ^.^ 
and verbose :D I'll try to include all the informations that may
be relevant, sorry :P

I have been on HRT for almost 7 months now (3x2mg Estradiol, 
2x100mg Spiro and 0.5mg Dutasteride) but I don't know 
what to think about my lab results...maybe someone here knows
a bit more than me about these things and can help ? ^.^

Blood for these tests was drawn at 8 am (12 hours after the last pill 
of E and Spiro, 24 hours after Duta) and here are the results:

*Estradiol 	214.2 pmol/l 	(57.8 pg/ml ?) 
*Testosterone 	0.66 nmol/l 	(19 ng/dl ?)
*Free T.		0.8% 

That's just estradiol not total estrogens, I think, and they're 
the same from my previous blood work (July, same
doses, but Finasteride 5mg instead of Duta)...the only difference is
Free T: it was 0.48% in July, when SHGB was higher at 128 nmol/l, now 102.

Are they good ? Bad ? Meh ?
My endo was satisfied with the 200 thing there, but then I noticed
that everyone talks about 150-200 pg/ml not pmol/l  :(

Problem is:  I didn't notice almost any change so far...I do
have something on my chest now, just maybe 1/2 inch thingies
still and oh, dry skin...yuppi XD

No emotional changes, no lighter/softer skin, no shiny hair, muscle 
loss, less body hair...nothing.

I lost about 20 kg (44 lbs), intentionally (mostly just fat) in these
7 months, which probably didn't help but still, with all those meds 
I'm not sure if the complete lack of results from HRT are due to the 
hormone levels or if it's still just too soon.
It feels like my transition is not going anywhere and I just lost
3-4 more months since July, while I'm already on borrowed time :(

Or maybe E levels are fine and it's just due to the time between the 
last dose and the blood tests and it's all just in my head, for a change ? XD

My endo is a good person, but I'm his first and only tg patient.
I'm abroad an finding a different doctor who is ok with HRT and also
speaks enough English is not easy for me in this country.


TL;DR Unsure about estradiol levels. Are they alright or should I ask 
for a different dosage ? what ? gel, cream, patches, sprays ? 
Injections are a no-go, here :/"
GothicJude,asktransgender,Questions about Medicaid and FtM transition?,"So i found out me today that Medicaid will pay for some of the costs of transitioning. I'm pre everything FtM, age 19. I'm (most likely) only going for therapy, HRT, seeing a trans specialized physicians, and a hysterectomy and depending on how well i pass afterwards i may not not get top/bottom surgery. Anywho.....I was wondering if anyone payed for it this way and how much each thing was (therapy, hormones, hysterectomy, after care) after insurance. Was it still expensive? Does it depend on income or anything like that? Also, if it makes a difference i live in the state of Washington near Seattle. Thansk in advance!"
ouijaboredt,asktransgender,SRS?,"Ok so I'm starting HRT in a couple days but I've been thinking about SRS for a long time and I know that I want it. Would it be possible to get it in like 12-16 months? Ideally I would wait a few years for the hormones to do their thing for a while, but I *think* my insurance isn't gonna cover me when I turn 24 in 2018 so i guess that's why I would wanna get it a little after a year. Is that waaaay too soon?"
noodlepot,asktransgender,E has fallen down in half. 6 months. What do?,"Hi. 

So my endo started me off on a very lose dose - 50mcg patches twice p/w + 5mg Finasteride daily. My E was about 200 pmol/L and T pretty high at about 12 nmol/L. About two months ago they've upped my dose to 100 mcg patches and 100mg spiro daily. I got my results back today and while my T is 2.6 nmol/L, my E has dropped to 76 pmol/L. Being 6 months in, this makes me incredibly depressed. Is this normal? What can I do? I'm in the UK and I'm doing this privately, paying out of my pocket and unfortunately the endo is not too easy to communicate with and he doesn't seem to be very co-operative. What should I do? I feel horrible."
CounterHump,asktransgender,Coming out to Counselor,"Hi, all. Sorry, I forgot to phrase the title as a question.

This is my first post (maybe on any public online forum. I don't like the internet.) so it'll be self-serving and worthy of eye rolls. Also kind of a general introduction of my situation because I don't know what's relevant or important for good answers. Be gentle.

For pretty much as long as I can remember I've had the idea in the back of my head that I'd be so much more comfortable as a girl, though never considered the thought anymore than a tertiary fantasy. I've lived my life convinced that I was some sort of disgusting, hunched monster incapable of any kind of connection and undeserving of all I've been given. (Art teachers have compared me to Van Gogh, which while flattering, sure doesn't reassure a troubled teen's deteriorating psyche.) At the same time for whatever reason I've always been super fascinated with the transgender plight both as a social issue and in terms of what it practically entails. Because I'm a god-damn idiot I never connected those dots until around... Let's call it new years. That's a nice, clean Approximation. 
Maybe it was all the attention that politicians have been putting on the subject of late that grabbed me and pushed me over. I assume that was the opposite of their intentions.

All this year and pretty dang intensely over the last few months I've done a pretty fucking good job of training myself to believe I'm trans. Lots of reading and vlog watching has made me feel so comforted. I'm all but convinced at this point. My life just makes sense in that context and for the first time I can see a future worth getting up in the morning for. Not to mention how much calmer and kinder I've been to my loved ones once I mentally allowed myself to make that switch. Physically I've been taking a lot better care of myself too. Everything about who I was prior to this year seems like angry entitled bullshit through new eyes. I can see why people were always wary of me before I even opened my mouth.

So a couple of weeks ago I made an appointment with my uni counselor to talk about these issues. She was pretty backed up with appointments so I've had to put myself through nearly a month of anticipation. Now that it's coming up I'm terrified I've made a horrible mistake. 
I don't want to come out to her, but I don't know who else to turn to. I have no friends, and I'm sure as hell not going to start with my family (Not that I fear rejection. It's just a big thing to jump the gun on.) I feel like I'll have to justify my claim to her in some way. I'm so incredibly bad at communicating even the most basic ideas; And forget about articulating feelings. The first time I went in to see her for anxiety attacks (which I'm now pretty sure is related) I was so all over the place and bad at talking that she actually thought I was high. To get the conversation going I had to convince her that her that no: I'm just like that all the time. That's my shitty excuse for a personality. Now I'm supposed to go back over my life with her and a fine-tooth comb under the context of getting the medical community to facilitate the changing of my core identity? Because I'd like to be smoother and wear nice things? Who the fuck am I? That's not justified.

Long freakout short: How did you first bring this up with a professional? What information and questions should I bring in? I don't care if I have to slam a stack of insane notes on her desk when I walk in, I don't want to float the idea out there then immediately chicken out when she asks follow ups.

Convince me not to cancel the appointment, please.

Sssssssent. I'll check back in the morning for replies."

imiradu,asktransgender,Am I trans?,"Hello. I am a 16yo biological male.

- As a child I enjoyed playing with dolls and other girl's toys and didn't like violent games.

- I fantasise about being a girl.

- I prefer to grow my hair long and sometimes put on women's underwear and pad myself out to be more feminine. The thought of wearing women's clothing and looking like a girl turns me on. I prefer girls clothes to boys clothes.

- I find it easier to make friends with girls and most of my best friends have been girls. 

- As a child books about\for girls always fascinated me.

- I enjoy TV shows, films and novels aimed at women.

- I sometimes adopt female personas online.

- Having children of my own is one of my main life goals.

- when I write fiction (my main hobby) the main characters are usually either female or effeminate (bi/gay/asexual) boys

- when people refer to me as ""one of the guys"" it feels odd

- I really dislike my (male) name for some reason

- I like to wear gender bending clothing eg pink socks and shirts, frilly shirts, knee boots. I sometimes copy my female friends clothes styles (e.g. one friend's red jeans).

- I suffer from depression and loneliness (feeling like I don't fit in) a lot.

Am I trans?? what should I do?"
raquel-eve,asktransgender,What it's like to get FFS with Dr. Spiegel.,"I had FFS with Dr. Spiegel on Sept 20.

The procedures I had were:

Forehead contouring with scalp advancement &amp; browlift 9,675.00

Mandible contouring 8,125.00

Rhinoplasty 8,175.00

Lip lift 3,500.00

Operating Room 3,050.00

Anesthesia 1,440.00

Recovery Charges 700.00

Total Surgical Fee: $34,665.00

I had the consult last December. I scheduled in early March. His prices went up about a week after I scheduled. I also added a $1,500 lip augmentation after talking to him at my pre-op on Sept 19.

After talking to him I was much more confident going with him than elsewhere. I mostly wanted the scalp and forehead work and my nose straightened, but given that the only legitimate complaint I've ever heard about Spiegel is that he's too subtle, I just did everything he suggested.

They are very very busy (I think because Dr. O. retired). Their prices went up about 30%. So the price for the procedures I got is now more like $45,000. The consult fee has gone up to $200 and the deposit has gone up to 30%.

Sometimes the staff is hard to reach, but they were very nice. Honestly, they acted like they're used to dealing with pretty flaky clients and it was a breath of fresh air dealing with someone who paid on time and showed up on time and had everything in order.

By contrast, a friend of mine had FFS with Dr. Z. in Chicago the week before I did, and she described him as fairly obnoxious and aggressive ... and downright sadistic when it came to taking off her bandages.

**pre-op**

Here's me at the pre-op on Sept 19:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L0La_UlaNmJq1bXJm7ILvCwhj0tu0SW64A

I'm allergic to Percocet and Vicodin, so they gave a prescription for Dilaudid. I also had a prescription for 7 days of antibiotics, a prescription mouthwash (because I wouldn't be able to brush my teeth), and 

I wasn't particularly worried about the surgery. I broke my arm in a motorcycle accident two years ago and had surgery to put a plate in my arm. That was the first time I was under general anesthesia and it was kinda fun :)

Also, I suspect many trans women know what I'm talking when I say I feel like I'm a bit of a badass. After years of laser hair removal and dealing with being trans in general, I just don't get very worried about things. Going into FFS, I thought I'd be pretty much back to normal after two weeks.

Although I did start to take it a little more seriously when I read in the pre-op instructions that I should expect to have my eyes swell shut. Also, I was told it would be a 5-hour surgery, which seems pretty serious.

**day of surgery**

I was staying at an Airbnb in Brookline. I took an Uber to Boston Medical Center and got there at 6:00 am. About 6:30 they got me a room and I met some nurses. Everybody was really cool. I met the anesthesiologist and he was a really cool younger middle-eastern guy.

When I had surgery on my arm two years ago, they put me under before they even wheeled me into surgery. So I was a little surprised that I was still conscious when I was wheeled into surgery.

There was Dr. Spiegel. There was Dr. Nikita Gupta who has a fellowship with him. The room was full of doctors and nurses. It all started to feel very serious as I drifted off... All these people are here to rip my face off!

I woke up:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BNSk9-p3GK-2QhysuhbT41E-xONKQUlM-w

I felt kinda OK. I'm a pretty positive person and I'm always trying to be friendly, but ... I was numb most places and everything was pretty foggy. My throat really hurt from having the anesthesia tube in it for hours. With my tongue I could feel that my mouth was full of stitches. My eyes felt puffy. Everything else from the neck up was numb.

The nurse told me I was going to get a lot more swollen. That was a little terrifying, because I already looked like hell.

They wheeled me to my room.

I could feel my nose draining down my throat. My nose was 100% blocked. I had an oxygen mask on my mouth. There were ice packs attached to my head with an ace wrap. I had an IV and other things attached to me. It was just too much of a mess! Everything was getting tangled up. It was hard to keep the oxygen mask over my mouth. It was hard to keep the ice on my head.

My oxygen alarm kept going off. I was in a lot of pain. They tried to give me a pill, but it was very difficult not to spit it right back out when I swallowed since my nose was stopped up. Blood from my nose was draining down my throat. I started to feel really sick after about an hour and vomited a lot of very dark blood.

It was dark outside, the nurses weren't paying attention to me, and I was nauseous, vomiting blood, and my oxygen alarm was constantly going off. After the third time I hit the button and they told me they were sending someone but nobody showed up, I had a bit of a freak-out and started crying.

That was a rough night sleeping upright with a ton of stuff tangled around me, puking blood, in pain, with ice packs constantly leaking all over me. And my eyes were swelling shut. It was the most miserable I've ever been.

**the day after**

The next day my eyes swelled completely shut. I could open the right one just a very tiny bit with a lot of effort.

Dr. Nikita came in and changed my bandages.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=15gQwTm8UqoOjLAoi46FUiydPDo7yjQdnbA

They let me go at 11:00 am.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N6Xjbuc9SsFuYyuBz7sL_BtsA5EZrMdKcw

They told me to sleep on a couple pillows to keep my head elevated. Apparently two pillows wasn't quite enough. I got a lot of blood on my pillow that night. My hair was completely full of scabs. The right side of my scalp was basically one big scab that felt like it was almost an inch thick.

My lips were so chapped they felt like they were on fire. I certainly didn't expect that to be so painful, but it was probably the most pain that I was experiencing. Sleeping was very difficult. I needed to keep my head elevated and breathe out my mouth. I usually sleep on my left side and it's hard to sleep on my back, but putting any pressure on my jaw was very painful. So I really didn't get much sleep.

**the third day**

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zd7gFfXgrnbLQl5RrDT4AYnyVyBrMuHthw

The first two or three days were so awful that after that I was in a pretty good mood. After three days I tried washing my hair. It was very difficult. You have to lean your head forward to keep the weight of your hair from pulling on the incision. With your scalp being numb and covered in scabs it's hard to feel like you're accomplishing much.

The third or fourth day I was able to get a minuscule amount of air through my nose. This makes a world of difference because you can swallow right, and you can also exhale somewhat through your nose. When your nose is completely blocked eating is very difficult because you have to take a deep breath, eat a bite, swallow, then exhale out your mouth.

**the sixth day**

By the sixth day I was feeling a lot better. I still felt pretty bad, but it was a lot better.

I washed my hair a second time. I spent an hour washing it, but I still couldn't get through that matted scabby mess.

Eating was easier, but my cheeks were so incredibly puffed up that I felt like half my food just stayed in my cheeks and I couldn't really fish it out.

I felt good enough that I went to a bar with Maxine, the woman I was renting an Airbnb from:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iExJujcSeY-cBJhbNoaYwqMfJHTj1s2czg

**the seventh day**

On the seventh day I started to get feeling back in my jaw, and that was not a good thing. It started to ache horribly. My jaw muscles felt very cramped. My chin was very sore. My whole jaw area was in pain. It wasn't a horrible getting-my-teeth-drilled feeling, but there was a hint of massive toothache-type pain.

I tried to keep pressure on it with an ace wrap and kept putting frozen peas on it like I was instructed, but that just didn't seem to help much.

**post-op office visit**

I had my post-op with Dr. Spiegel on the 8th day after my surgery. The staff was really nice.

Carole said, ""Are you still taking painkillers?""

I said, ""Nope! I haven't had any since Saturday!""

She looked concerned. ""Well, you might want to take one now.""

Dr. Nikita and another woman both descended on me to take my stitches out. Most of my stitches were dissolvable, but the ones in my scalp and several in my nose weren't. So they took them out, then replaced the ones in my scalp (sans anesthesia) with dissolvable ones.

**17 days post-op**

Fast-forward to 2.5-weeks post-op, and my black eyes were a lot less scary. My jaw was still quote swollen and hurt. It was still difficult to sleep, but not nearly as difficult as before.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oHSFi-4vEphsRiBerA6Y5w_Erkc5TrFr6A

It was around this time that the feeling came back in my upper lip. And that was pretty painful. Anybody who's had laser/electrolysis on their upper lip knows the type of pain I'm talking about. It's a very pinchy eye-watering feeling. It felt like that for most of the day, but then it got better.

**25 days post-op**

Which brings me to today. 25 days post-op.

I forgot to mention that every day since I've gotten out of the hospital I've had a lot of trouble sleeping. I'll try to go to sleep at 10 or 11 pm, but I won't get to sleep until about 2:00 am. And then I'll wake up at 7:00 am in a cold sweat. It's a weird feeling. I'll wake up feeling cold, but clammy. My sheets will feel gross. I don't know if I'm hot or cold. I just feel gross.

But today, 25-days post-op I actually feel like I slept like a normal person. And I got up and washed my hair, and most of the scabs are out of it.

I finally feel pretty normal. My jaw is still a bit puffy, but it's not actually painful.

I can still feel a stitch in my nose and several in my scalp that haven't dissolved yet.

It's cool having an upper lip. I'm very happy with my nose and my lip.

The scalp advance was something I really wanted, but my hairline looks the same as it always did. This is because my hair fell out in clumps near the incision. So I have to wait for that hair to grow back to see what it actually looks like.

My scalp is numb. A friend of mine who had FFS with Dr. O. in 2008 said her scalp was numb for almost a year. So that means I have to go almost a year without using a blow-drier. Or at least I can't turn the heat on, because I wouldn't know if I was burning myself. Bottom line, my hair is going to look like a crazy woman for several months.

The tip of my nose is still sore and feels like it has a lot of pressure in it, but it's not very painful. Wearing glasses/sunglasses is still somewhat uncomfortable.

Anyway, if you have any questions feel free to ask! I just wanted to tell my story!

**7 1/2 weeks post-op**

You really don't know how uncomfortable you are until you start feeling better. I my jaw stopped hurting as much a few weeks ago ... but now I can actually lay on my cheek without my face hurting.

My nose is still really sore to the touch, and my chin is still sore to the touch. But in general I don't have any perpetual aches anymore. There's still some puffy tissue along my gum line in my mouth.

I got out and went to Dallas Fetish Ball.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZwy-UwOSjUe8uIDKKWkxTG3E2i7Hyyb9A


**my takeaway about mandible contouring**

I expected the scalp advance to be a ""big deal."" But I didn't expect my jaw to keep hurting for weeks and weeks. It makes sense, though, because they made five incisions along my lower gumline and ground down my jaw/chin from the inside of my mouth, so of course that's a pretty traumatic surgery.

melynda12,asktransgender,Not being suicidal enough = no hrt? or is it BS.,"So, i'm very early in my Transition and recently just came out to my therapist, but i'm seeing a gender therapist next week to start my investigation for having gender dysphoria (It's a must in Sweden because DIY is illigal). Anywho, after reading alittle i've read multiple stories of people being denied help here in Sweden for not being suicidal enough to recieve help, because if you're not suicidal apparently you don't quality to be trans or having gender dysphoria. So, i've known my entire life i'm trans but tried to run from it, but only lately accepted it, but i've never been suicidal i've kinda just isolated myself instead and never really thought about suicide at all. This makes me wonder if i should just lie about it and say i've been thinking about suicide and what not. I'm not sure.. I've always been one for honesty (apart from hiding me being trans for years)."
princesspeachless,asktransgender,How to politely ask someone if they're trans?,"I was working one night and I saw someone who I was pretty sure was trans. She was passing really well, but I notice all the little things that I'm concerned with for myself. She seemed super nice, and we're in an isolated area that is generally conservative leaning, so I'm looking for people to talk to about transitioning who have gone through it themselves to see what their experiences are. 

HOWEVER, I'm not out yet, so I don't want to insult anyone or make them feel uncomfortable by what they might consider being called out by some random cis stranger. How would you all suggest approaching people in these types of situations? 

I always try to air on the side of caution, and I know some people are just trying to live their lives and wouldn't want to have interactions like this, so I'm not sure if I should even try."

I know i'm being really impatient, but I'm really hoping to start hormones as soon as possible, and I was wondering how long (in sessions) it usually takes before you can get a prescription. 

Now that i'm actually so close, i'm also getting unreasonably worried that he's going to tell me that I need to tell my parents asap, or that it's going to take a while before he feels comfortable putting me on HRT, and I don't know what i'm going to do if that happens. "
potatochocolate,asktransgender,Should I freeze sperm or not?,"I'm 20, MtF and the only thing stopping me from beginning HRT is whether I want to freeze sperm or not. I've never intended on having kids, so at the moment I'm considering not bothering with it. Here are my pros/cons of freezing sperm:

Pros:
- having option of biological kids
- adoption is expensive

Cons:
- freezing/storing sperm is expensive
- using the sperm for IVF or IUI is even more expensive, and has no guarantee of being successful
- no intention of having kids
- if I do want kids, I can adopt

I want to begin HRT and not freeze sperm. Later in life, if I ever want kids, I can just adopt and I'd be comfortable with that. So there's my decision. But at the same time, knowing that after I've started HRT the option of having my own kids will be gone for good. :/ What do you guys think? Has anyone else here not frozen sperm and instead are adopting?"
KC-Chris,asktransgender,Went out dressed for the first time and it went horrible. Really need some hugs and advice.,"So this story is intertwined with my first relationship since coming out so please bare with me. Now ex-GF and I had a wedding to go to so I thought I would fem it up a bit and wear a dress that I really liked. I have been having a really bad time with my disphoria that last couple of day and I thought It might help to push past it a little. Oh lord was I wrong.

I arrived at my GF's place to go and she informs me we need to make a stop for stuff at target since the groom (also Trans which is part of the reason I felt safe) needed something. Long story short a family with small children stopped in the store to point and laugh at me.

Feeling like shit I asked my ex for the keys and went out to calm down and start the car. When she arrives she flips shit about how I shouldn't care about others opinions and then freaks out more and tells me I am not her date anymore and to just go home.

Well at her place I pack my stuff and leave a note that she treated me like trash and I needed an apology from her.

She then tells me we are done and that she dosen't have time for me since I don't know who I am or what i want. This cut pretty deep.

I fear going out now and feel like a freak. Please help

hopeless92,asktransgender,Should I try to patch things up with my family?,"4 years ago when I first came out my conservative and catholic family didn't take it very well. I won't delve into the full details, but they more or less disowned me and cut off all contact. I haven't spoken to them since, but I've always sent them letters on holidays and birthdays, which were never responded too.

Fast-forward to the present and I've decided to detransition. My medical and social transitions were both a failure, and about 6 months ago I completely gave up and went back to presenting male full-time (I've been presenting as a man at work for even longer because noone would hire me otherwise)

Even though they treated me rather poorly, I still miss my family and would like a relationship with them again.
I'm considering writing to them to tell them about my detransition and to apologize and let them know they were right (which is a lie) and that transitioning was a stupid decision on my part, and that I'm over my gender issues (also a lie) and that it won't happen again.

While I still love my family, I worry that I've irreparably damaged our relationship, and that things won't be able to go back to how they were before. And I'm concerned that re-establishing our relationship will just be inviting even more pain and toxicity into my life."
Reon98,asktransgender,How did you distinguish gender dysphoria from stress?,"I want to apologize at first if I use any words that are otherwise unacceptable. I'm very recent to this community, and really the LGBTQ+ community as a whole so I'm still fighting a lot of the internalized language I have been provided by society. With that out of the way, I think I've been experiencing gender dysphoria lately. I'm not sure I want to transition as I believe I am gender fluid or bigender, but even so, I like having concrete answers to questions such as these. The problem is, I am an extremely stressed individual. I physically don't know how to combat stress most times and, although it isn't usually a problem, it does present challenges in day to day life. This includes identifying emotions within stress. I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone else on here been in this place, and if so, what did you learn? How did you figure it out, and what do you wish you'd known beforehand? Thanks a ton."

I self funded and paid for my FFS (£16500) myself and had been privately paying for my Rx until recently and am on the NHS pathway following private diagnoses etc so I've done what I can, I just wondered if anyone had gone this route with NHS (it's half heartedly mentioned in the guidelines)

whatshouldievendo839,asktransgender,Should I inform my doctor?,"Hi all of you lovely people, let me preface this by saying I'm at least biologically male, and maybe MtF or genderfluid or who knows, as well as 16 and in highschool. I've struggled with dysphoria and such since I was a little kid but it has always come and gone, so I've never really felt the urgency to completely figure out my feelings until now.

Lately I've been experiencing a lot worse dysphoria and it's very constant, etc. etc. the usual post on this sub. I've decided to just wait a little and try to let myself figure out exactly what I am. The problem is I'm currently seeing a doctor for numerous different mental disorders, and he is constantly changing antidepressants to see what will help me.

The latest antidepressant really changed a lot in me, but the main depression is still there - and now I wonder if my dysphoria could be the cause of that; and thus, I wonder if I should tell my doctor about it.

Normally I would just tell him, but we've grown close and I know that he is both very conservative and very close to my family (who are also conservative), and I'm worried about him violating my privacy. It's a bit of a conflict of interest, and I don't really think seeing another doctor is a possibility.

Do you think I should tell him, or should I maybe just ask my parents for a therapist and I'll make sure the therapist can help with gender identity?

*Oh, and less urgently, is transitioning at school without my parents knowing a possibility? I would have my friends' support and obviously administration wouldn't be able to do a lot, but I'm wondering if anybody has some advice for me.*

Thank you very much! &lt;3

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention, I really should be referred to a therapist anyways, but my general practitioner is personally close to the disorders I face and I don't want to see him less. And if I saw a therapist would I have to discuss my disorders too? It would be hard to find one that deals with both that and gender-identity. Aah! I appreciate any insight on this you might have"

kitka3ses,asktransgender,Do you think there's too much violence in portrayal of trans people?,"I'm a cis bi woman and I'm on the process of learning things from every point of view in the community.

Hayley Kiyoko recently released a music video for her song, [One Bad Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_wXWFnTjxU). It features violence against a trans woman (also portrayed by a trans woman) so TW for those who want to watch.

(If you don't know Hayley, she has been some sort of an icon for some of the wlw community. She made songs that are explicitly about women's attraction to other women.)

I've read some things on tumblr about the video that concerned me. I am upset that some were disappointed because they were expecting Hayley to ""drop something gay"" again. Aside from these comments, there were two others that stood out. One was that it has too much of trans misogynist violence. Another was that she was ""saved"" by a cis man (portrayed by a cis black man). They form a platonic friendship in the end of the video for those that don't want to watch.

I liked the video (though it made me tear-up) because I think that it conveys a message. But I still feel that music videos and other forms of art and media representation focus much on the violence experienced by trans people. There are few to none that portrays you in positive and/or light-hearted way. However, I realized that it's not really my place to speak with regards to this so I would really like to hear your opinion. Thank you.

EDIT: Wow thank you for the great responses. I really appreciate it. I will keep those in mind and share it to people who work in the industry."

Anyway, she agreed to do it. I called my therapist and used my new name as identify. She replied ""Okay, SIR, your mother can get a copy of your medical records.

I mean, what the hell. I know that I don't pass, but my voice isn't that bad to get gendered male (I think). And even if, I clearly stated who I am because she had to look at my profile. Example of my voice: http://vocaroo.com/i/s119CDqw7HG4

Achalys,asktransgender,Need a bit of help to be sure.,"I don't know , this is pretty hard for me,  im 19, but since my 12 that i have wished to become a girl, although in society things were a bit odd, and i was suffering bullying at the time so i just tried to not act wierd to raise suspections.

this grew, i realized more about the universe of transgendering, something that made me aroused true, but also really good with myself. 

For years now i love to read stories about guys becoming girls, its a fantasy i know. But in the last year its been pretty hard to repress my own wishes of becoming a girl. 

My depression got worse each time i repressed it , and i met a transgender friend in my online game wich is mostly my social life. And that gave me the push i needed.

My close online friends already knew for ages that i had this kind of fetish AND had alot of gender doubts, i never felt like a guy, nor i do, i hate myself and my body completly.

Im 1,90m tall, chubby, bulky and fairly manly, so people expect me to be a guy, and i hate disappoint them, and after a long while i decided to first, come out to my sister in real life, wich she took very well and supporting, i also spoke with my psycologyst, tho he has no experience in dysphoria field , we are going to try to see how things go.

I had read alot about dysphoria, and im trying to accept myself as a transgirl, sincei admited it i feel so much free and at peace with myself, so refreshed its odd. 

MY Trans friend, told me that i really should now, try to go and accept myself, to be careful (wich ofc im going to be) and take slow steps. She also said that i should let this... lets say, girly side of me grow, and that i should express myself (to my online friends for now) as i felt better with myself. So everytime im refered as a she, or something happens that makes me feel so good with myself. But im a bit ashamed it also makes me feel aroused. thankfuly that arousal is getting less and less, and now i just mostly feel just good with it. Ive been trying to act like a guy my whole life, so every little thing that makes my brain click and feel free to be myself makes me feel great.

I don't think this is a fantasy, im pretty sure it is not, but i also would like to know opinions if im rushing things up but im nearly sure i have dysphoria, due to the fact i never really seen myself as a guy, wanting to become a girl for years and other common symptoms of it, so i would like to know:

- besides knowing and seeing the dysphoria symptoms, any good tip to try to identify it.

- do you think that based on the little information that i gave, i possible have dysphoria?

- Should i ask my online friends to refer to me as a she, thou i have not done YET any type of changes in real life.

- If so, is it wierd? it makes me feel very accepted.

- Am i rushing these first steps? i mean, coming out to my sister and to my psycologyst sure was a shock because ive been aware of my actions and trying to hide them for years. But my friends online know i got gender identity problems for a lot of time. 

- I want to look for a specialist in dysphoria just to be sure, ASAP. i don't want to rush things but i live in portugal and things here regarding the process are really slow from what i've been told. 

- when im with my sister im going to tell mom, she will support me in the conversation since my mom is quite... close minded, any tips to help her understanding?

- 

- Anyone got any tips in overall? im really sorry for this wall of text...."

TakMasaki,asktransgender,Why are people transgender?,"I apologise in advance if anything I say sounds transphobic. I assure you it's not, I'm simply ignorant, and want to become more informed. I'm a cis male, and I have no issue with people being transgender, obviously everyone should be free to do what they want with their body. I just don't understand what it means to not feel your own birth gender. I don't see my maleness as anything more than having a penis. I understand that their are societal norms for men and women, but even if I were to have behaviours commonly associated with the female gender, I wouldn't see that as meaning I am a female. Are people trans purely for aesthetic reasons, preferring the look of the other gender, or is there another reason that I'm missing? Any responses would be much appreciated.

Edit: thanks for all the responses, I think I somewhat understand now. So many of my friends and people in different places on the internet seem to view transgenders as cis hating teenagers trying to seem indie. I thought this description of transgenders seemed suspiciously like a falsified strawman, and your friendly and informative comments have proven my suspicions right. Hopefully society will stop creating these dumb stereotypes of minorities, but if history is an indicator, only the minorities will change, not the hatred."

I'm tired, I don't feel guilty and I have been trying to live with it for as long as my life has been going but now I'm tired of those boners.
The thing is I don't know if I try to convince myself I'm trans just to get rid of it. :/
For some of you with the same condition and have been removing the sexual aspect from the equation, how did it ended up feeling ?

EDIT: to simplify it, I can't help to get sexual while imagining myself as female and I am really exhausted by it. However I can't say that I think I'm trans because I really am or it's because I want it to stop invading my life."
ded5723,asktransgender,Sex drive issues (nsfw),"Howdy y'all, I'm starting to approach my fourth month of hormones and I've had a problem with my sex drive.. It doesn't exist! I bring this up cause my girlfriend is starting to feel neglected sexually, and while I can do stuff in bed, I'm having huge huge issues with having no drive and thus, I have difficulty initiating sexy times.

I naturally always had trouble initiating but it was never to this point.. We're trying certain things and she's completely understanding of the stuff I'm going through. We have an open dialogue about it, and I suggested maybe having scheduled sexy time so that we can properly set aside time for it so that way I'm focused and I can have a reminder on to sex her up. 

She's not being unreasonable at all. Cause we go on long spurts of not having sex, or me telling her we'll do it 'x' day, and then it slips my mind (I have a terrible memory). The disappointment and going without intimate relations I'm sure makes her feel unloved in that department.. 

I don't think I'm having disphoria with my penis.. Most times I'm fine with it and others I'm indifferent and it won't do what I want it to. We're also experimenting with this too cause at time I do feel it and we try other things like butt stuff or what have you. 

Is there other ways to help aid my sex drive? or like.. any suggestions? Our relationship is fucking amazing and this is the only thing that's not up to par, and could become a large issue later on in our relationship :(

Zoey-D,asktransgender,When does estrogen start to work?,"Hello everybody. I'm kind of at my wits end here. Today marks the 5th month that I've been on HRT but I feel like I've made no progress physically what so ever?

Some background: The first month I was on Estradot 100 due to elevated liver enzymes(alt sgpt) but had to stop them due to falling off/tape rashes developing. From then on I got switched to Estrace 4mg/day which I was super happy about, cause I knew that my body was actually receiving the dose. But after a blood test in September showed that my alt sgpt started rising again as well as my doctor told me that my prolactin levels were high. Told to finish pills, then start Estrogel two pumps/day. The only thing that has been constant has been 25mg Cyproterone/day and a gallstone chilling inside me. (No pain or anything)

I know the cyproterone is working, based on my libido becoming nonexistent as well as my doctor telling me that my T levels were pretty much nuked, and increase in depression. Maybe I can change to Spiro cause of depression? But I don't even like pickles.

I just feel like...I should have seen something by now. I look in the mirror and see no changes. Minor breast growth maybe, but dark thoughts tell me its more of a prolactin tumor. Maybe its buds. I'd like to remain hopeful that it is. (39.5 inch on the nipple, 36 on rib bust, conical shape) My best friend says that hes been noticing very subtle changes but i'm not sure if hes just hugboxing me or whats going on. It just seems that everyone else gets the magic happening for them within the first few months. (based on transtimelines)

Is this normal? Did I get the short end of the stick? Is there a way to request blood test results in Canada without seeing my GP or HRT doctor? Peace of mind knowing my levels are proper would do me wonders right now. I just fear when I see my HRT doctor next in December that I still won't have seen any progress.

I know this isn't a race, but its very disheartening comparing my progress to other peoples progress.

I am a fan of both but didn't realise that the certain comedian was Transphobic. I mean in retrospect duh but he once said a few homophobic things about lesbians but now doesn't due to having a few lesbian musicians on his show it was like it expanded his mind. And being a queer woman who has hope for the world on LGBTQ issues I thought maybe if they exchanged ideas he would walk away with a better understanding. 
Now, I am not putting the work of  acceptance on trans people and as a (sometimes ignorant but trying not be ) ally I seen some people who say dumb things but definitely come around. 
So I guess what I'm asking is, did I mess up? I feel terrible that I asked. Honestly I didn't think she was going to respond which is kinda cool too because I'm a fan of her work. I'm scared now that the few trans friends I have (2) and one cousin who is MtoF trans are low key disappointed that I listen to the guy. Since this goddess of trans pointed out this comedian is Transphobic I don't listen to his podcast.
Now I'm just kinda looking at my life and feel bad that a lot of my outlets for entertainment my not have an inclusive audience or maybe not very welcoming to the trans community. I mean I love prog metal... I'm sure that kind of shit isn't welcoming to the trans or gay community.

Quackhop,asktransgender,What's transphobic and what's not?,"I know this has been discussed before, but now I bring it up again. 

Is it transphobic to refuse to date someone for being trans? Is it transphobic to generalize gender and biology (genitalia/anatomy) like cis people have it (pregnancy is a women's thing for example)? Should we accept being ""lesser men and women"" than cis people because we're such a small minority in comparison? Are we just whining? 

I may have a bias because I don't understand monosexuality so I don't understand how genitalia matters so much if someone is otherwise great. I think saying not all women have vaginas, not all men have penises and gender isn't always simply male/female is a legitimate statement but I don't want to be unreasonable.

update: I don't think it's necessarily transphobic to refuse to date a transgender person for beign transgender. However I would recommend everyone who'd have that opportunity to really consider it, it could be a really great person they're missing out on, but if they can't go with it, that's fine too. In many cases cisnormativity is a better word than transphobic, which I still think is something we should fight against. As trans we should be exactly equal women and men as cis women and men and non-binary and genderfluid people should be just as valid as anybody else."
Unreliable--Narrator,asktransgender,Coming Out at Work,"Today I sent an anonymous email to the HR Director of my employer coming out as trans and trying to gauge how much shit I'm going to get transitioning.  I based the text on a similar email someone else posted here a while back.


Hello [HR Director],

I am an employee of [Company].  I am also transgender, and currently in the process of transitioning.  In reviewing the company's non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies in the employee handbook, I have become concerned that gender identity is not specifically included or addressed.  To my knowledge, there is no company policy currently in place regarding transgender and transitioning employees.

I have decided to write anonymously for the time being, as I am not yet prepared to proceed publicly.  I expect it will be at least 6 to 12 months before I am ready to present as my identified gender.  I want the human resources department of at [Company] to have sufficient time to consider any necessary policy decisions, clarifications, or other preparations.

If you have any questions or comments, please reply to me at this address, and I will be happy to answer to the best of my ability or provide any other information or resources that the company may find helpful.

I would prefer that my situation remain as confidential as possible in the meantime; I don't wish to become a cause of gossip, or endure increased scrutiny from those curious to determine my identity.

Thank you for your time,
Jane Doe


I haven't heard anything yet, but I sent this at the end of the day, so that's unsurprising.  Now I'm just trying not to panic.

ZbopJrock,asktransgender,Here's the thing....,"I'm sorry in advance if I use any uncomfortable terminology.

So I'm 21 currently and for the past 2 years I've had a sense of dysphoria. Honestly it's only because I found the term at that point in my life. I was doing research as to be more sensitive to my various friends who have ""come out"" as trans. When I was in sophomore year I branded myself with the bisexual label, as I didn't know pansexual existed. Even before then I remember my ""generation X"" father telling me that my mannerism were for girls and I should stop. So I did. Being bounced around through custody of various parents and grandparents made me adaptive. 

Fast forward to dropping out of college after the first year. I was deemed medically unfit for the military, which made going to a military college quite difficult. I became depressive and drank like a sailor. After high-school parties where I was deemed the ""party princess"" it was nothing new. After I moved away from my dad I juggled the idea of dysphoria. My then girlfriend looked at the situation single-mindedly. "" I like your penis, don't get rid of it.""  

I adapt. I am male. A white male even. As awful as it is, why should I uproot my whole life and decide to become part of the minority? I am a man, I repeat to myself. The drinking get worse. I try new drugs. I sell my new drugs and run a trap house.....

We get kicked out. Too many ""friends"" spending the night. I respectfully end our relationship with the landlord. Studio apartment. What if these feelings weren't for no reason? Polyamorous relationship? Open? I need to be with a man. We set rules and guidelines. Nothing in our bed. We are up front and honest. We don't hide anything from anyone....

I surprisingly find her in bed with someone I don't know. Fuck this. Drinking is now a daily event. My new landlord and aunt facilitates. I turn 21 and now I know every worker at the liquor store. I have a career in mind. I am male. I am a man. Yet every time I drink I want to mutilate my genitals. When I'm sober I adapt. Be sucessful. Help the family. Babysit. Hand money to mum and dad. They gave enough to me. Why? What am I doing?

Adapt. Mum wouldn't understand with her bi-polar and schizophrenia. Don't bother her. Dad wants a legacy and grandchildren, don't bother him....

Why can't I be happy? Ever? Is this regular depression and possible hereditary mental disease? Why do I always cross my legs when I sit? Why do I constantly worry about my eyebrows? Why am I so caught up in looking like a man, but always want to shave EVERYTHING? Why does gender dysphoria KEEP popping up when I'm sad? Am I trying to find a way out with labels? I'm helpess. 

I have no clue if I'm in the right place. Should I just be worried about the fact that I'm lost or that I know where I'm supposed to be and won't accept it? I apologize for the novel, but I haven't let this much of me out to anyone. I need it somewhere. I need help and don't know who to ask. Thus subreddit has been the nicest community I've ever seen. Anyone who has been through any transition has been to he'll and vhallhalla at the same time. 

Opinions. I need someone to tell me I'm wrong. I need someone to tell me this will blow over when I become a merchant marine and I'll have a nice house with a picket fence 2.5 kinds and a dog and a cat. 

TL:DR I'm sorry for clogging your subreddit, but I don't know where else to go..."

One is fairly politically conservative, but he's more libertarian than religious conservative, so I'm not super worried about him. The other is super liberal and I don't think she'll care.

The one I'm most worried about is the girl I dated off and on throughout high school and a bit in college. We are still pretty close, and my family basically considers her an adopted daughter. They all wanted us to get married, but we realized in college we were too different to be successful long term. She's married to a nice guy and has two kids and there is no lingering romantic or sexual tension, the last time we were intimate was over 10 years ago.

That doesn't stop me from being nervous about coming out to her though. In my gut, I feel like she is going to be super supportive, but the romantic/sexual past makes me super nervous. She's a fairly liberal person and I know she cares deeply about the LGBT community, but I think her experience has largely been with the LGB, not so much the T.

I'm not planning on doing this anytime soon, I've half decided to wait on coming out to any of the three people until after I find a therapist again (I just moved to a new city/new job and am waiting for my insurance to kick in).

Anyone faced a similar situation? How'd it go? Advice/thoughts?

----------------


Born male. 18 years old. Getting therapy within some months idk when to begin my work towards getting the diagnosis of being transgender in Sweden so I can get hormones and I hope that it will help me gain clarity.


This shit has been going up and down for months now. I am tired and apathetic about it. I don't know with what I want. Sure I wanted a female body and to look female but never cared about my expression. Mostly so that I maybe could love this horrible and pathetic body I have. Or become more certain and happy to atleast make the discomfort and ""stranger"" feelings I have to my body.


I did not know since I was young and it started up as a desire around the age of 12 which was heavily connected to my sexuality. And no I don't think its a fucking fetish.. sorry but that has been brought up before but ugh....


I am too reliant on others. I don't want to change so that they will have to react to that change. I don't know anyone in person that I could talk to in person about this.. I don't even know what I want to do or express. I know that I don't want to express myself with female clothing etc until I have an actual female looking body. I have 'crossdressed' however and always felt amazing in the clothing. At first sexually but now they just feel better in general..


Then whenever I see sexualization of women I get this strong disgust of wrongness.. I don't want to add sexism and objectifying of women. Along with my sexual attraction to female body it usually confuses me. Usually however I am more jealous of the body wishing it was me than actually being attracted sexually to it.
The permanency of hormones scares me and the idea of being female to the world and family feels like too much..


I also have a strong ""taboo"" sense regarding female underwear and ultra feminine stuff as since a young age ""I was teached that it was disgusting"". I dislike extremly feminine stuff in general but I think want to be female still and express myself as I wish.


There is this stalemate of apathy within me right now. There goes not a single minute without me considering this shit and its driving me insane. Normal therapy did shit to help aswell so my last hope is gender therapy..
I am too afraid to either admit or reject it to myself. Most likely admit it. I've read the null hypothecis, other narratives all the shit so many times but I can't see any more clarity or certainty..


In the end I am just scared...


I am fully aware of the fact that its my choice but its a choice I can't make.... Idk what to do......


Sorry just had to vent this shit."

openess_,asktransgender,dealing with my blog and my new friends..,"Hi. A while ago we saw a couple of posts about stelth, and I thought this might be appropriate, but didn't want to flood the sub with stealth posts all at the same time..

I'm mostly stealth today. I don't really talk about trans issues with people offline, and my personal blog where I write about everyday things that pop into my mind has pretty much gone back to what it was before I began to transition.

During my transition I wrote on trans issues from time to time. One of my most shared posts is about going swimming for the first time since transitioning. And I kind of want to have those posts because they were part of my life at the time that I wrote them. But they have begun to be a problem for me.

I got back to school, kind of, this september. A bunch of my classmates want to be facebook friends. Obviously they do, this is 2016. But all of my facebook posts are notifications about updates to my blog. So anyone on my friends list will inevetably find my blog, and possibly see the category ""trans posts"" in the menu on the right.

Now on to my problem. I'm thinking of simply deleting all posts in that category, or possibly all posts older that some convinient date. But I would feel bad because i know trans people sometimes read my blog and find it helpful. It's just that as of now my blog is preventing me from making (facebook) friends at school. I feel awfull about it.

I know this post doesn't have a question as such, but I hope it can be the basis of some discussion, and perhaps help me decide what to do with my blog/facebook/classmate situation."

I posted the above thread yesterday and didn't get a lot of response so I thought I'd try again with a broader topic. How do you reduce bottom dysphoria? 

Things I already do:

-limit the use of my genitals during sex

-tuck most of the time

and ... that's all I've got. Any other tips? (I tried to make my topic inclusive so please feel free to chime in anyone! I'm more than happy to listen to non-penis-havers.)

I still need to use my penis some to orgasm but using it during sex is probably the worst time for dysphoria for me. I have to distract myself by imagining that it's a vulva/clit when it's stimulated. I also kind of hate the feeling of fullness in my tuck but I can't really do much about how it feels. "
feelinglostf,asktransgender,Struggling socially?,"I'm 20, MtF pre-everything but about to begin HRT. I've been shaving all over, growing hair out, going through HRT process etc. I plan to come out after 6-9 months on hormones, and hopefully by then my voice/makeup/hair will be on point too. Physically, I know I'll be happy with my transition and coming out. But socially and mentally, I'm struggling.

I've recently gotten rather sick and tired of my group of male friends. I know that I'll lose the majority of them when I come out because they hate trans people and anything remotely gay. So naturally I'm distancing myself - I figure, I might as well just drift away now so that when I come out, I don't have to deal with them rejecting me. If that makes sense?

Same with my uni friends. I go to a Catholic university and studying something I don't like. Next year I'm transferring to a different university and degree. I've been distancing myself from university friends because I know they'll be devastated when I change degrees, and again I don't know how they'll react to me being transgender.

My family are somewhat homophobic/transphobic. Nobody in my entire extended family (lots of uncles/aunties etc) are gay or trans. Very Catholic, conservative, etc. I don't know what to expect from them when I come out. All I know is, I want to move out before or when I come out, to reduce the awkwardness or potential rejection.

I really want a fresh start. New home, new place, new university, new degree, new friends, new body. I just don't see that happening, realistically. I can't afford to move out, I'm super shy so making new friends will be a challenge. The fact that I'm trans will only make it harder too, especially if I'm constantly clocked due to my voice or something.

I'm sitting here, with calls to make to book appointments and begin HRT, but I'm riddled with these thoughts that I won't be accepted, that I'll lose everything and be lonely, and that I might not even ever pass. I know that I shouldn't worry about what anyone else thinks or whether I pass and focus on myself, but it's hard. I want to come out to my sister, because I know that she'll be accepting, but I feel like the moment I tell a family member, there will be no turning back. Any advice for all of this will really help. "

Ivybridge80,asktransgender,Post SRS physical sensations,"TLDR warning.  Jump to last paragraph to see question.  The rest is filler re: my experience.

So, I know our bodies are great at getting used to sensations.  We are fantastic at deciding, 'oh, this is the norm' whether it be for smell, missing digits, or extra bolts.

A question we see many times in /mtf/ and here is 'How to tuck?'  Occasionally, in those topics, we'll have a response like, 'I don't care to do it because i find it too uncomfortable anymore'. 

I'm one of those who is likely to respond as such.  I struggle to keep everything in, unless I'm wearing normal panties, then a pair of boyshort panties over it.  But that usually ends up giving me a wedgie..

When I lived as a boy, I wore boxers all the time, because I hated the sensation of my penis sticking to my scrotum. Boxers provided easier ability to shake it lose.  Living as a woman, I wear tighter jeans now, and have really only worn boxers when doing really extraneous work - home project construction stuff.  Since I do my best to keep ruffage to a minimum down there, I still can't stand the sensation of sticking.  

Lately, during fun times, I keep myself tucked because (while I certainly didn't expect this to happen, it did) I'm finding myself becoming more displeased with the fact I have a penis at all.  It hurts when it gets excited, because I don't exercise it as much as I should.  

TL/DR - the point.
All of this leads me to my question.  A few weeks ago, someone posted (as people do) an AMA Post-Op.  In this topic, they said it felt like a tight-tuck down there.  For those who've crossed that bridge, does it still feel this way?  How long post op did that sensation go away, and it became normal?  Is there the sensation of flesh sticking/laying on flesh?

H41KU,asktransgender,A letter to past me:,"Fuck you. Even as a 5 year old you were smart, and so smart that you knew showing *any* signs of wanting to be like your sisters would be met with some sort of fight from your father, which would involve some sort of verbal abuse to your mother. You were good at lying, and constantly lied. You saw your sister's friends play, and wanted to play with them, a bit. You were sad when they locked you out from playing with them. You genuinely liked Spiderman and superheroes, and for that fuck yeah! They taught you how to be a good person, and to be fair. You had a single friend, and you loved video games. You thought about being a girl, but never said anything.

Why could you not just be yourself? I can't curse you for not acting as the girliest girl ever, because that's just as awful a lie as trying to be the manliest nerd ever. Just... why didn't you be yourself. Dress up with your sisters more, asked to wear the stuff you liked of theirs and wear it around the house, as opposed to stealing it and wearing it in your closet. It was survival at the time, we thought, but now what's happening?

6 months ago I started taking the thought I was transgender seriously. Now? I've seen a therapist, two weeks after that I saw that facilities doctor to talk about things I already knew, 2 months after that I saw a nurse for my mum, her, and myself to talk about all this. My mum kept mentioning she saw no signs (I distinctly remember I dressed in a tutu that I loved once, but felt bad after), and the nurse (whom was great) mentioned I'd have to go to the family court to get estrogen.

I just really wish I was honest about what I felt, and yet even know I have a hard time expressing emotions because pretending to be something is my default mode. I wish that 5 year old me didn't lie to everyone he ever met about who she was, and did what she wanted, and played with girls, and dressed as a girl.

I am now living full time as a mtf trans-women but not a day goes by when I am constantly questioning myself. For me, what I am doing feels more like an experiment to find out who I really am and if indeed I really am transgender or just a transvestite. When I read and hear about how transgender folk grew up and what they went through as a child or as a teen, I can't relate to it completely. Yes I did have experiences of wearing girls clothes when I was very young and used to paint my nails with tip-ex in class but that was about it at least I think. Basically, I wasn't unhappy being a boy, I played with boys toys, I made friends with other boys. I just liked to wear girls clothes from time to time.

flacdada,asktransgender,I am going to try and come out in these next few days (again) and I need help with words.,"TLDR. I already have said the words I am transgender to my family. But not the words I am a girl.  I want to get a therapist/do something about this.  Anyways.

But I don't exactly know what to say. I'm not a person to make a big deal out of things. It's a big thing but that doesn't mean it has to be the big announcement and declaration.

There are definitely going to be the words ""I feel like I am a girl"" and ""I've come to my conclusion""  ""I want to get a therapist.""  And in those words my parents hate certainty with big decisions or life events that they have very little control over. They're amazing people just irritating with stuff like this. Only pet peeve of mine. And hopefully get them to start using my slight name change, it's a gender neutral alteration of my given name I love that it's a thing.  Pronouns later.  Id also love to get them some resources.

The crux of my question is the icebreaker, the way to say it and not sound like a drooling moron and of course how I can express to them that I want to transition.  I mean I don't know where to start.  "
Clarnico,asktransgender,"Is anyone else sick of the transphobia on reddit, or am I being ""too sensitive""? [rant]","Just the little comments here and there, regardless of what sub I'm on are getting frustrating. 

A small amount is to be expected (eg, someone not ""in the know"" just making a badly worded comment that stings more than it should but not intentioned to be malicious doesn't bother me)... but the sheer number of people either trolling or incredibly ignorant just feels really toxic.

Getting messages out of the blue with things like ""You'll never be a real man"" or ""you're just a woman on steroids, stop pretending"", and it's just pathetic. Anyone else dealt with similar things? 

I'm still in all honesty shocked that a hate sub is even acceptable here...

JediDalek,asktransgender,Parents Just Attempted to Use Glam Rock to Talk Me Out of Transition. Any advice/insights here?,"So, yeah... Basically, I do a paper route with my family every week, and generally after I came out, the conversations have tended to steer clear of anything regarding transition. However, the other night, we got to talking about 80's hair bands, and how guys like David Lee Roth dressed/presented themselves in ways that were traditionally ""nonmasculine"". Then my Dad says ""and that's like your situation, *guyname*. Just because you don't like doing things that are ""masculine"", whatever that even is, doesn't mean you're less of a man...""
I didn't really respond at the time, but I feel like that approach they took kind of gives me insight into how they're (mis)understanding why I want to transition. So far, I just haven't been able to put it in a way they ""get"". Does anyone have advice based off the above?"

What i mean is, if i do go through, i don't want WHO i am, i know who i am and only want to change what i am physically.

From the few things I've read so far, it frankly sounds horrifying to me, the prospect that something like who I'm attracted or the way i act could change significantly.

I had to Google this when my son told me it was an actual day. And it is. 
Today will be the hardest day in some people's lives. The day you make public, a secret only you have known, for what has likely been your whole life. It, in most cases, is an eye opening experience for some, a great learning experience for others, but a true chance for understanding above all else. Orientation, or physical being, is not a decision made in the mind. The mind is formed and functions from birth on it's own preset path. How we deal with it, and what path we take is the only decision we truly have. Being LGBTQ is a chore in and of itself in today's society, so outing yourself to the world is a huge step, that should be recognized for the bravery it takes. It opens an opportunity for hate to flow forth, or love in it's place. It's never known which will come, and so the decision is truly a hard one to make. I give my support to all who brave the waters today. You've done amazing by speaking the truth, and I wish the best of best wishes for travels in the future. 
That being said. 

I was born Transgender. That is to say, my soul and brain do not match the body I was born in.

I am now working towards telling all I've ever loved what the future holds for me.
I've known, since I was old enough to really know anything, that something was off, and just didn't feel like what I was being told. If you went to school with me, or knew me in my younger years, you may remember I never quite fit in. I spent years figuring out who I was supposed to be and eventually started taking after my older brother to be a guys guy. At about 8th grade I met a friend who saved my life, as far as school goes, and truly gave me a chance to make friends. This person gave me the opportunity to fit in with the other guys, and not get bullied for being different. This also gave me the guidance I needed to see a true guys life and follow suit. Since then I've made friends with many of you and formed the perfect cover as a guys guy, car guy, and good guy friend. I went through my friends list and actually remember all the people on there, most all have been good interactions in a life I'll never forget. Some of you have dropped everything at one time or another, some in the middle of the night, to help me get through times when sitting alone thinking of this was too much. You didn't know it then, but it was a saving grace I needed to continue. 
I have continued. I've gone through life and proceeded with all the things they tell you to do as a guy. I'm married, have beautiful children who love me, and a career I've spent many years forming. I've achieved all the goals I've set out to achieve, all while constantly lying about myself and to myself about who I truly am. It's been an uncomfortable, and often times painful, journey to where I am today. 
This is where I am today. This is my outing to you all, and from here I move forward. It's not going to be an easy journey to get where I'm going, but I thank greatly anyone who chooses to go through it with me. If you cannot, I respect your decision to remove yourself from my life. If I loved you, I still will. If you ever meant something to me, you still will. 
I don't ask for your prayers, I've already said my own more times than I can count and am ready for that future as well. I will not force your support, or try to force understanding upon you. I have to do what is right for me, and show my children what it means to not be afraid of the world and truly be yourself. 
If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. If I didn't tell you face to face, or before this post, I'm sorry. Some of you.....I couldn't find the words. If anyone wishes to talk further about it, I'd love to."
f92520,asktransgender,Libido issues?,"I'm a trans woman and I started HRT in mid-2013. From February 2015 to March 2016, I was unable to get refills for my prescription.
 
While on estrogen, I've experienced a pleasurable drop in libido. Lately however, I've found my libido increasing again. I'm not quite to the point of a testosterone-fueled libido yet, but getting to a point where I'm beginning to get uncomfortable with it.

DarkLeach7,asktransgender,Dysphoria getting worse as transition progresses?,"As I've progressed throughout my transition, the dysphoria was always there but I never really paid any mind to it.

It's just like the dysphoria came back and hit me full force and I feel like it's only going to get worse...

The more and more I've feminized the more the masculine features I see (and what's in between my legs) bother me and it's gotten to the point where I used to tolerate it but now it's just debilitating and I can't stand it. I don't know what to do. My mom and sister gave me really big hugs this morning and we basically had a girl's day out and it helped me feel way better. I just don't know how I'm going to deal with this in the future, I can't just avoid shaving my face nor taking showers forever...

Mtfthrowaway168,asktransgender,"Came out to girlfriend, not sure what to think","22yo mtf, came out to my bisexual girlfriend yesterday and got a reaction i'm not sure how to deal with.

I was talking that i was depressed with my life, that dysphoria made me depressed and apathetic/indifferent to everything, that i had suicidal thoughts because of it and that it makes my life difficult in every aspect (including sex, which i ended up faking that i was enjoying when in reality it just made me dysphoric, i used to think sex had to be awful for some reason).
I can't even properly make friends, and transitioning would make me happy.

She had no reaction, until she said ""Well, why don't you just pretend to be happy?""

I answered that i didn't want to live my life feeling like a zombie dead inside, because i tried to fake for almost 10 years and it's just gonna get worse.

She said ""You should try supressing and getting used to it.""

I honestly don't know what to think, i feel awful and i'm starting to think she doesn't really care much about if i'm happy or not.

queen_of_storms,asktransgender,"After months of being unbothered by misgendering, I'm suddenly done in by a single ""sir"".","I'm MtF, about a year and a half on HRT. I still get misgendered a fair bit because of my voice but I've always been able to shrug it off. I'm just recovering from being sick, and being as I look awful (being sick always makes me look like I'm a year behind where I am for some reason), I've been really struggling with dysphoria, especially the last couple of days, I've just had a really really hard time seeing a girl in the mirror, and it's weighing on me like I've got a giant invisible leech on my shoulders. So I put some work in, washed my hair, did my eyebrows, etc, and walked to the grocery store for some frozen berries. I swear most days the ""would you like a bag, sir?"" would have slid right off my back, but this one got in. I tried to shake it off, kept telling myself it wasn't bothering me. Somehow, I keep revisiting it and I keep seeing a guy in the mirror. It's skewing my perception of myself and influencing me toward a negative spiral. Something so subtle, so seemingly harmless, has changed the course of my entire day. Now, I am fighting this off every ten minutes, and it's getting harder and harder every time. It's not like there's an originating event where being perceived as a man hurt me, though many such instances have reinforced that hurt. It's just something that always feels wrong and always has. Today, because I am vulnerable, it got in and is giving me a hard time. I'm not used to it like I was. I had forgotten how much this hurts.

I really wish people didn't feel the need to say sir or ma'am. I seriously just hate it. What a stupid tradition. It adds zero to an interaction wherein one's assignment of second party's gender is accurate (majority of cases), and hurts the rest of us. Of course the lady behind me got ma'am'd, and it just felt like a microcosm of the whole experience of having my gender systematically denied by everyone since ever.

I don't know if this ever really ends. Has anyone got any experience on this? Is there any way to get past this, or are we just doomed to be periodically cut open by benign words?"
sugarpunk,asktransgender,[NSFW] How do combat dysphoria in kink?,"Okay, so I'm pretty dainty and not going to get into the gritty details too much, but here's my sitch. Me: 25, non-binary AMAB trans lady, she/her. My partner, 20, AFAB agender cutiepie, any/all pronouns. When we get down and dirty, I really feel at home in my gender, except during some certain activities, which I really like and still want to continue.

We indulge in a healthy amount of kink stuff and we're both switches. When I'm being submissive, I feel incredible and totally at home with my gender and my body. However, when I'm being dominant, I find myself being really dysphoric because I basically do things the same way I did when I was 20 and still thought I was a boy. (I didn't come out until 21.) And like, doing dirty talk and stuff, I still feel like I'm talking ""like a guy."" I know there's no such thing, and it feels completely irrational, but that's sometimes how dysphoria is, I guess. 

I still want to be dominant with my partner because I really do enjoy it, but I'm feeling these dysphoric feelings at the same time. Can any other switchy/domme trans girls offer me some advice to be able to enjoy myself again? I'd really appreciate it."
niku_j97,asktransgender,My roommate found out about me.,"Hi guys, I'm Nishchal (birth name) but i have a seperate online identity of Nishita/Nikita. I'm 19 now and 20 (next year) will mark the start of my manhood (end of teenage) and even the thought of it scares the hell out of me. I never wanted to be a man, always thought i'll grow up to be a Mom but today something terrible happened. I'm crying right now and both my roommates are asleep. 

One of my roommate found out about my second identity and he made me delete every single bit off it, i was able to prevent him from deleting my reddit and instagram. He said i might have had this thought of being a girl from less than 10 years now and i can definitely change my thought process completely. He said this will be the first step towards it. I tried to explain him a lot, but i too had no logical explanation to it and i wasn't able to explain him why it's so important to my identity. He believes i can be normal again and this will save the shame i'll cause to my parents and threatened to tell everyone if i don't delete my accounts.

Is he correct? I know my feelings are very genuine but then why was he not convinced. Does this proves i'm not a true transgender and this is all just a childish thought which i carried with me and made it real (i mean God did not made me this way but i myself have created me). Even if i could be treated i don't want to, i knew i wanted a girl since 13 but i was never feminine and maybe that's why no-one takes me seriously because i hide myself all the time. Some girls are tomboyish but they don't want to  be a boy/man so why can't i be like that, why all gender stereotypes should apply to me. 

I'm not financially independent and that's why i was avoiding talking to mom about this although i came out last year around January but she considered it some form of black magic. Should i talk to her again, or at least tell my brother (he too denies my existence). I see no future for me, i'll be considered selfish if i transition and most definitely be abandoned and if i don't then life will be a living hell for me. Should i not rather die?

henx125,asktransgender,How do you deal with the fear of never becoming passable?,"I always used to tell myself that even though I wanted to transition it would be better if I didn't. I never really felt uncomfortable in my 'original skin', only miffed that I couldn't take pride in it's presentation to myself and others. 

I reasoned that the problems I would have to deal with as a result of coming out and as a result of my transition would make that option not worth the trouble. 

This reasoning largely hinges on my doubt and the fear that I would never reach a point in my tentative transition where I could look in the mirror and feel confident in the image that was cast upon it.

But lately, my dysphoria has intensified. I can't fall asleep because I lay awake thinking about my future and realizing that there are certain things in my life I will miss out on, certain things I *have* missed out on.

I feel an incessant, unyielding frustration whenever I am met with thoughts relating to my appearance or my gender or my love life. 

I notice that I must be in a state of depression, because I keep trying to distract myself from these thoughts by binging TV and video games; avoiding sleep until I'm so tired I just pass out. Obviously this has negatively affected my productivity to the point where I am no longer doing assigned work and am constantly skipping class.

So now I am getting to the point where I am fearing the future. Fearful that this will only get much worse. Considering how quickly things have escalated, I do not want to even try to envision how I could deal with this weight for the rest of my life. This fear is starting to outweigh my fears about transition, and as such I guess I am now reevaluating my options. 

So how does one deal with the fear of never fully passing? Even if I could change my physical appearance to match my mental one - which would be a miracle in and of itself - there's no way on Earth my voice could be anything other than a nagging reminder that I can never fully completely transition, is there?

womaninthearena,asktransgender,"Can someone please explain ""male-presenting trans woman"" to me?","I like to connect with a lot of trangender people on Facebook. It helps me better understand their issues and learn quite a lot of things about the very sensitive subjects surrounding trans issues which are often very difficult to grasp.

One of these friends identifies as a male-presenting trans woman. She goes by a masculine name (let's call her Daniel), wears men's clothing, has short hair and a beard, and from what I've seen of the YouTube videos she uploads her mannerisms are completely masculine. She doesn't identify as non-binary or gender fluid. She identifies as a woman, but only ""male-presenting."" Her only feminine attribute is a pink bow in her hair.

I try to be very understanding and open-minded about gender identity, but this one confuses the hell out of me. I've never asked her personally because I don't want to insult her. These questions can be very delicate things to ask, and I don't know if she's comfortable being probed on how she identifies herself.

I understand trans women who are not too worried about passing either because their gender identity isn't defined by their appearance, or they think the pressure to pass is trans-phobic and problematic. But Daniel identifies as someone who deliberately appears male in every facet, yet identifies as a woman. She identifies as a woman, yet is more comfortable *living as a man.*

This just doesn't make sense to me. If you identify as a woman, doesn't that mean you want to *live your life as your identity?* Why would you purposely live your life as a man if your identity was woman? Again, I'm not talking about people who don't care about passing, are non-binary, or gender fluid. Daniel describes herself as a male-presenting trans woman, and that is exactly what she is.

Seriously. What am I missing here?"

But there’s a problem (or maybe it’s not such a big problem as I think) that my family doesn’t know about me. I haven’t told them anything, neither my Mom, neither my sister. I’ve got a job, but I go to night school, ‘cause in the next year I want to go to Medical University, I want to become a psychiatrist to help people (especially like me, ‘cause in my country there’re very-very few really competent doctors in issues of transgender people), and I really like psychiatry. I live with my family and it seems to me that they already notice something. I grow hair, tweeze my facial hair, my look changes. And I’m sure that sooner or later they’ll seriously ask me. And I’ll be a liar in their eyes ‘cause I hid from them so much important thing, didn’t trust... But what if I tell them and they’ll reject me, or even will hate me…

Where I live most people really don’t like persons like me, so I don’t know what will happen next in my life, will I have friends or won’t, will I lost my job or won’t, what if I enter university and then I’ll be suddenly expelled from it ‘cause my nature.

I just got done playing a game with few friends, we don't get to play often since we live in different timezones and we also have a life of our own we have to worry about. I played with four of my online friends, three of which I have told that I think I might be transgender, all very accepting and referring to me with female pronouns and all. I feel like a bad person for getting jealous all the time of a friend of mine because she has a high pitched voice and all that great stuff.

For some reason I feel hurt a bit when the people that support me use male pronouns even though I tell them they don't have to call me by female pronouns yet because I'm not sure about it. I feel as if I want to go through the process of HRT, but that my parents will get annoyed living with me. I'm not too sure on their stance of trans* people. I know, however, that they will help me and not abandon me. I just feel as if all this paperwork will stress them out even more than they already are. Also I'm afraid that they will think of me as a weird human being that's confused, which I might as well be for all I know, heck, I think I'm an idiot.

So I've been pretty sure about being trans for 10 months now. And I have no idea why I'm not coming out to my parents. I tried to e-mail my mom once, but ended up just going on her account and deleting the mail. I think I might be scared for their reaction, but I know I would be able to tell them someday. I think I might be lazy, because I could've started at such a young age (13) but I am just now waiting and waiting it out (15, almost 16 right now). Or I think I might not find it important enough, that I will manage to live either way, transitioning or not. I never felt like it's a life or death situation, I don't FEEL like a man or woman, I just exist. I do think I might be more comfortable living as a girl than as a male though. I think so because I chat a lot online, and in cases where I tell the other I'm female, I feel much more like myself, much more happy and more active. It might be wrong to tell people I'm female but that's what I feel and prefer for them to know. Which I think I've read, should be enough to get hormone treatment, which I'm also not sure about since I live in the Netherlands and you have to go in therapy to figure it out.

Anyways, I'm not sure what I wanted to achieve with this post. Sorry. Thanks for reading though if you did. I appreciate it. I just want to figure out whether I should start taking action or just wait until I'm 18 and do it all on my own.


EDIT: Added some things."
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel like cis women seem to have better defenses for when their femininity is questioned compared to trans women? (and likewise with trans men compared to cis men?),"I ask because I don't feel like I can hold my own as a girl, in social situations.  Im already shy as is, but whenever i start interacting, i feel tested, and i feel i fail these 'tests'.  i know i dont need to prove myself to anyone, but i end up trying to anyway.   around men, they just seem to see me as a guy still, no matter what i do.  around women, same, but in a different way.  it sucks.  i dont think its just the people, i think its just how people react when someone is trans (some people of course are more understanding/accepting than others)

I reckon its my lack of confidence, and my belief that I've missed out on years of socialization that cis women got, as well as getting taught male socialization that i forced myself to internalize.   i dont really know how to get past this block, that is ultimately just in my head, but feels very real :/ 

edit: i just realized that i think i test people too.  maybe i hate feeling tested because i end up testing others...but maybe i started testing others because i felt tested.  i dont make friends good, hold them to too high of standards and never feel content, its terrible.  i think its internalized transphobia, and not being able to totally relate to cis people."
Mellowbelle,asktransgender,How long does it take facial hair to fall out after laser hair removal?,I think I've seen some people say it took like 3 weeks. Is this common? I'm at one week and haven't really seen much difference. Am I just being impatient?
nafssertam,asktransgender,I feel a little ashamed that I discovered my transness through porn,"I first started to think about gender when I had been watching trans porn for a while. Increasingly I began to see myself as the girl. I loved the idea of having feminine features and wearing girly clothes. I also really loved forced feminization. 

It took me a while to realize that these feelings existed outside of sexual situations. While I am sure that I am really a woman in all situations I can't help but worry about the effect of discovering this through porn. I feel like there will always be a dominant sexual side to my journey that might taint it. 

I didn't realize at the time, but I even picked my new name because it was the name of a trans girl who posted in gwtrans. I love the name and want to hear people call me it, but I feel a little confused about picking it. 

I know this all sounds a bit confused. I just want my transition to be emotional first and sexual second. I'm afraid I might be fetishizing myself and transgirls like me."

ShakeBunny100489,asktransgender,E Injections Availability?,"It's pretty common knowledge that getting on injections these days is very difficult due to the shortage.

I brought this up with my doctor (because I strongly prefer injections to pills). She said their pharmacy (Callen Lorde in NYC) and all others in the area are out, but if I could find a reputable place that could provide them, then she will gladly write me a script.

So my question is, are there any legitimate pharmacies that can accept my doctor's script and mail me injectable estrogen? Looking into it I've found Stroheckers pharmacy in OR can do it, but I'm not certain.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as pills really aren't doing anything for me. Thank you everyone."
piscina_dela_muerta,asktransgender,"Am I taking crazy pills? Aka, am I really selfish because I want my mom to accept me?","So a couple hours ago I posted this on twoxchromosomes

&gt;Hi everyone, I'm 21 years old and about 11 months ago I came out to myself as a trans woman and started my transition. My mother found out in March when my ex fiancee' told her without my knowledge or consent. Now, my relationship with my mother wasnt the closest thing ever beforehand. I grew up in an extremely religious household and nothing would have made my mom happier than me finding a nice Christian wife and settling down into some manual labor job and having a bunch of kids. Since I eventually ended up as a pansexual trans woman who never wants kids, you might guess that we didnt always get along or agree on such things. But that was fine.

&gt;But since my mom found out, she became extremely angry at my ex, blaming her for making me ""gay"" and ruining me. And just generally pretending that everything is normal and fine around me. I've asked her to stop calling me ""he"" and my deadname but little to no effort has been made on that front. She also refuses to call me by new name stating ""(my name) is the name I had chosen to name my daughter which isnt you."" (I chose to use the name she was going to give me if I had been born with a vagina). And guilt tripping me every time the subject of my transition comes up by talking about how hard it is for her to deal with. When I say how hard it is for me to deal with to, I get brushed off with ""it wouldnt be so hard for you if you'd just stay a guy.""

&gt;And while this stuff hurts, what bothers me the most is how I cant share my life with my mom. I'm going through puberty for a second time. I'm getting a second chance to live life in a way that makes me happy. I want to tell my mom how happy I am with the new dress I bought. I want to tell her how I finally reached an A cup and now my bras actually fit. I want to tell her how I went to the doctor and this little girl told me I looked pretty. But I cant because it only leads to a shitstorm.

&gt;And I know this is a greiving process for my mom. I know she might or might not ever come around to the idea of me being a woman. She still says she loves me. She's still gonna send a Christmas gift (to my deadname and probably with a Jesus themed Christmas card but oh well). I just wish my mom could stop grieving her dead son long enough to realize her daughter needs her.

And I've had a few people calling me out for being selfish. I'll gotten this response for expressing this irl. Am I really being selfish by wanting my parents to love me? I know it takes time. I know they might never be okay with it. But the only request I've made to them is to call me Holly and stop using ""he"" as a pronoun for me. They have outright refused to do both. Have not even attempted to do so. The rest of the post is just wishful thinking. But does this make me selfish? I just don't get it. I try to think from the other perspective but I can't imagine not even having the respect for someone to stop calling them a name they don't like. I'm just venting here.

sniperjarsu,asktransgender,how to cope with all this,"Hello. (slightly drunk and non native speaker, sorry in advance) I'm a transgirl 19 year old living in finland.
Now i'm pretty clinically depressed (F32.2) and seeing a therapist. Now i would want to start my transition badly but for that i would have to been trans for 2 years to even be considered trans therapy (i have known to be trans for 1.5 years). Also i think my therapist think my transness will pass if i conquer my depression even though i have said i have lot of dysphoria. I can't change my therapist because i use public healthcare and can't afford private one (not like they can send me to trans therapist)
I'm feeling really bad about this and i feel like i'm a broken human being for not being born in right gender :(
(sorry if this does not make nay sense, speaking with my feeling and not with my mind)
"
MechaMaya,asktransgender,Just scheduled first appointment for HRT! ... But I have worries and doubts now.,"So yesterday I had my first therapist appointment (yay!), and was immediately directed to a doctor who could help me start HRT (double yay!).  In the high of emotions following the therapy that went so well, I immediately called the doctor and scheduled for next week...

Now I worry that I've fucked up. I'm not prepared for this. I'm moving too quickly for my own good. I don't have bloodwork done, and I'm worried they'll send me around getting blood tests and spending more money on appointments (not covered by insurance) before anything happens.

And I'm absolutely NOT in a rush to start HRT, I am trying to take my time because socially I'm a very long way from being comfortable presenting female. I'm not even out to my parents who I see once a week, and I worry that it's all going to start catching up with me soon.

I know you can live for quite some time on HRT before people start to notice (i mean as scary as it is, male failing would not necessarily be unwelcome...), but I've stalled and delayed learning how to properly present for years. I'm worried that while my hormones tick towards female, it'll start to outpace my knowledge on how to be female. I haven't even heard my own voice recorded yet... and slack off on practicing allll the time.

So I guess what I'm asking is... Am I moving too quickly towards HRT for someone who is very shy and nervous and not outgoing in the least? I have a friend who has started presenting female before she even started HRT, and I'm like the complete opposite of that. I don't have that confidence, so do I need to slow down?"
kernalmustache,asktransgender,Pants?,"My hips are getting wider and since the weather is getting colder I was considering going out and buying some new clothes. I was going to buy some tops, a jacket or two, and some pants. I'm wondering if buying pants would be worth it right now though because my hips are still growing. My waist is currently 27"" and my hips are 34"". I have no way of knowing how much more my hips will grow or if they will at all. Do you think I should bother buying women's pants right now? Or should I just wait a little longer and buy some men's skinny jeans with a larger circumference? Size charts always say that the hips should be at least 10"" more than the waist."
lilah_christopher,asktransgender,Yesterday was my one month anniversary on HRT and... I feel exactly the same.,"Okay, so maybe not EXACTLY the same. I may be a little less depressed the past couple of days and I don't seem to be as dysphoric. But I'm not experiencing any sort of mood swings or anything like that, and there certainly haven't been any physical changes whatsoever. Anyone else experience this? I think I'm on a fairly low does of estradiol (2mg twice daily) and Spiro (50mg twice daily). And I'm 46 years old. Should I just be patient or should I try to change up my doses or ask for patches maybe?

I've also noticed that I've started getting pretty bad head rushes fairly often. Kind of like free Whip-Its except I'm an adult so I don't enjoy it very much. Is this the Spiro maybe?"
[deleted],asktransgender,I don't feel trans anymore.,"So this has been bothering me for a while.  I've been on hrt for 16 months so far and still present as male since I don't think I pass yet.  But also because being socially male is just easy and I can live life without being noticed.


The thing is, my feelings of wanting to transition wanes and flows, making things even more confusing.  It took me a very long time to finally come to terms with who I am but damn.   I know I need hrt (don't plan on stopping at this time) and I already have ffs planned in a year but I feel like I'll live as a male for the rest of my life and I have no idea how I feel about it.


I don't know if this is normal or not, I even have a difficult time relating to other trans people and feel like I'm alone in not embracing all of this like so many others.  I don't know, anyone else feel like this at all?


*edit:*  

Just want to say thank you everyone for the input.  I definitely have quite a bit to think about and discuss in my next therapy session. "
[deleted],asktransgender,How does getting HRT work in Seattle?,"I have to move to Seattle from Orlando soon and I was wondering how the process worked. In Orlando I just had to make one appointment and I got blood work and my letter on the same day.

TransW,asktransgender,Who went on HRT when they didn't necessarily mind living as there assigned gender and why?,I'm like this at the moment but I have a HRT referral letter.
SirCidTheXVII,asktransgender,How do you figure out who you really are?,"I feel like the most wishy-washy trans person on the planet. I have no idea who I am/want to be or if there's a difference between those two that's never meant to be resolved. I'm AFAB and have been on T for six months and have spent that time publicly living as a man. I'm constantly flipping from loving my transition to hating it. One day I wake up and wanna be a super 'manly' lumberjack with a huge beard, hair all over my body, deep voice, and muscles to spare, and the next I wake up and want to be a closet female who lives as an androgynous lesbian, and each day, I want to take the steps to physically alter my body to bring myself closer to each given day's aspiration. As I transition I'm simultaneously fulfilling and getting closer to my true self, while at the same time getting farther (physically at least, which I've found is very, very important to me) from who I want to be. I don't know what to do about it anymore! Will this ever settle? Will I always live in partial regret?

I figure this means I'm gender-fluid, but how the hell do gender-fluid people deal with physical dysphoria? Considering my preference in clothing and general behavior is consistent between days, there's nothing I can do there really to alleviate anything, The pain/distress I feel as a result of my identity shifts is at least 90 percent due to my physical body, and I can't change my body freely. As I wasn't aware of this pre-T, I thought I'd be done with this after starting to some degree, but it keeps getting worse! 

Making it worse I don't know if these feelings are really weird. Given they happen normally when I see someone who embodies the ideal I wish I was at the time, I'm not sure if I'm confusing who I am and authenticity with other-worship, seeing someone who shifts who it is I desire to be because I find them so amazing. I don't even know if I'm actually trans anymore, as maybe I've just been emulating others I found fascinating in an attempt to distance myself from the me that I hate.

I realize these question/rant would be better asked to a gender therapist, but I don't have access to one right now and have no where to turn about the matter. I'm driving myself crazy with it (cause I don't know if I should continue or stop taking hormones).

I don't know, all I know is I'm lost and don't know who I am or what to do from here. Any advice?"
essenhoc,asktransgender,Help! I Feel Very Disillusioned?! [Extreme Mileage Anxiety],"Uhh so I'm pre-HRT MTF, 21 with extreme body dysphoria.
My silver lining was that HRT, along with a nice fitness regiment will allow my body to shape the way I hope it does.
""YMMV"", while it's very true and it cannot be helped in any way, is scaring me from even trying.
I might have depressed myself by reading all of the other people having difficulties with their transition and I'm scared I'll fall into that.
But a difference is that I'm going DIY.
Does that put me at an advantage?
Is there any way to eyeball my mileage based on my androgyny now (face, voice, emotional stability, mannerisms)?
What if I know for a fact I exhibit my mother's Genes more than my father's?
Can I expect to turn out the same (body wise) as her?

Please help. I don't want dysphoria to stop me from doing this. 

I need a change to my upper body as fast as possible. I know nothing can be done for my shoulders. That's ok.
I'm worried that I won't distribute fat properly or my waist won't elevate or I'll still have a wide box-chest/waist afterwards.

Is it really random chance or can my mother Serve as a reference point? Coincidentally my younger sister got most of her traits from my Dad. Can I expect to look the same as my sister if not my mother?
Is this idea relevant at ALL?

I can provide pictures if needed (I have no idea if that sounds impersonal or not, and I apologize if it does, I don't want to offend) in private.
I just need hope that this will work for me.
Main concern: My upper body. It's position, orientation, overall width.



"
LostStrawberries,asktransgender,"Accidentally... er, came out. Now what...","It was late at night and I was tired,  I had been thinking about it all and it was keeping me up as it has for weeks now.  
I've always known,  ever since I was around age 6 before I even knew the specifics, the details or the terminology.    I've kept it hidden all my life,  now being in my early twenties.   I've never even spoken the words out loud or put them to text, but I've always known.   I've always wanted,  I've always dreamed,  the person in the mirror was always a stranger.

It's like a phantom limb, but it's your whole body.



We talked for a while.    There's no... hate,  but it's obvious they view it as a sickness,  that I'm messed up and have to deal with it.  Desire is evil or whatever,  that it's just satan tempting you and all that.    That I'll be happy someday if I just ignore it all once I get a wife someday.

Obviously if ignoring it was working I wouldn't be kept up at night every night for months now.    Obviously if it was working I wouldn't be in this massive damn rut for 5 years now (Barely trudging along before then) where I lack the motivation, desire, or energy to do anything with my life because it all feels so fake and pointless,  it isn't the life I want to live.


As you might imagine from the above, yeah,  I'm religious.   Still am regardless.    I cannot fathom the problem with it though,  with being...  transgender...  (That's kind of painful to say,  because I can't imagine people wanting ""to be transgender"" isn't the very point that you wish you were born different,  to live THAT life?)

Like,  I don't have any issue what so ever with people's sexuality,  I'm very bisexual myself with experiences on both sides,  but I can understand how a religion would take issue with a sexual deviance that upsets their family values,  but,  transgender isn't a sexuality it's personal,  internal not external.   Looking at either side of the coin an M-&gt;F might be considered gay dating a man if they don't recognize/validate the new identity,  but then by that same token if they don't recognize the change then dating a woman would be straight by their own logic,  shouldn't it?    The ""Traditional family"" still holds true,  there's still a mother figure and a father figure...  One just looks like the other,  but from a religious perspective there's a male and female soul still there so... what's the problem.      Where's the sin? 

You're changing your body,  but literally everything changes your body.  Wearing glasses,  dying your hair,  cutting your hair,  dieting and exercise,  natural hormone imbalances, gaining weight,  working out for muscle,   accidents,  birth defects.    Someone who had their face burned off and went through surgery to try to feel human again isn't damned.    

If you intend to live in the same sort of life just with a skin you don't despise to see in the mirror every morning,  I cannot imagine the issue.    


*I should note that I'm just rambling at this point and don't expect people to be able to answer churchy questions,  but it's not like I've ever been able to talk about this stuff outloud before.*



I just desperately wish I was able to live the way I've always dreamed of.   I want to feel comfortable at a mall,  and not fight back tears as I pass clothing or jewelry stores,  I want to be able to dress a certain way,  act a certain way,  *live* a certain way.   It just cannot happen as a guy.  Life feels more meaningful in every way were I a woman instead.    For the past ten years,  since I was around 10-14 and had access in the first place,  I've already been living an online life as such and it helps me get through the days,  where I can feel more natural,  more real,  more me in ways I cannot be otherwise.  Being unable to share pictures of myself or share in voice communications is inconvenient but workable. Even so I feel like the life I've lived online for a decade is more real than who I am offline.  



And so now it's out there,  I've broken my silence.   It was met with positivity and support,  but the same support as someone who just told everyone they had a chronic illness or injury that would never go away.

Now I just feel terribly awkward and wish I could take it all back.  What was the point,  I always questioned what would come of it, this is more or less the result I expected.

I cannot imagine ever being able to transition,  having no financial support and being the useless thing that I am that has been unable to do anything since graduating.    Being around people I'm expected to interact with is painful,  because they're not interacting with the real me you know?  It's all fake,  and it feels like it's just cementing a social identity that could turn around to bite me in the future if I eventually do change.

So as many here can probably imagine....  it makes even thinking about getting a job all the more complicated and painful.

I'm going nowhere fast with so much of my youth wasted,  not that I haven't done things or been places,  but not a moment of my life would be better spent staying the way I am,  every moment would have been more enjoyable if I could outwardly experience life the way I do inside.   Every situation I'm in I feel like there's this mask I wear and experiences pass through it like a filter to the me inside,  but they bounce off the mask and that's all people see,  while the experiences inside stay contained inside,  true thoughts or feelings never being expressed.  


I can't imagine most people being able to grasp the depth of despair and desire,  empathy is limited by your imagination and I can't imagine most people having the foundation with which to relate with or to understand.



But all in all,  I'm just lost.

I have no idea what to do or how to do it,  I'm not even sure what sending this would accomplish,  but it's a bit of venting I guess,  and I've been reading stuff from here for a few weeks now.


**Edit**,  there's also the huge problem:  The only reason I would take the steps to transition is the hope that as you say I could be ""Passing"".  There's no point if I cannot pass.  I have to have that certainty,  but how can you know if you will?  I've read people say to just go for it and that hormones can do amazing things,  but to what extent?   My body is so broad and straight at my sides,  I don't have a lot of space between my hips and my ribs,  I feel like my chest/ribcage is too big,   even if the hormones worked wonders there's still the basic skeleton to be concerned about...    I'd probably sooner look like a professional bodybuilder than someone who looks natural in a dress...  And if I can't do that...  

More edits,  I maybe should also note that I'm not at risk of suicide or anything.  I'm a strong believer in the possibility of the future and that life can always change one way or another,  that what is impossible now may be possible in a few years.  Cures,  treatments for disease,  improvements in prosthetics,  that there's always the possibility that technology can improve to help a problem.  Which is why I'd rather live 20 years in a coma and wake up to nothing than to give up and end it all.  Ending it is submitting to what you are in the present and not giving life the chance to catch up.


**Edit**, yeah, I'm christian.  One of my life's mysteries is finding someone who shares my religion... but somehow is in a similar boat as me.  I like to imagine that maybe there's someone out there questioning their sexuality not being attracted to men and not sure what their place would be anymore.   
I kind of feel like transgendered individuals... like myself I guess...  are a fair answer to matters of sexuality like that.
A relationship that as far as the church is concerned is M+F,  while outwardly appearing to be a lesbian couple if that makes sense.
(Naturally if you don't have these beliefs or a religious background there's no such problem,  you do you and people be people.  But just speaking from such a background it sounds like a nice idea)

Most people in these situations tend to drop their religion I imagine,  and someone not religious probably isn't so likely to become one for me and neither would I want to push them to.

I kind of feel awkward in general though,  about being socially involved or dating before I settle down and accept life or the day I look in the mirror and see someone who can live the life I dream of.    It's like a feedback loop,  I need to gain one to move forward one way or another but I also want to more forward so I can gain one in the first place.

I... feel like a lot of people who would be open what I wish I could be aren't usually the sort to accept my beliefs,  while most people who would accept my beliefs wouldn't be open to the life I dream of. 

**Edit**:  This might be taboo to say, but this is kind of getting a lot of downvotes.  Makes me feel uncomfortable,  Is it because I mentioned I happened to have a faith that I don't push on anybody else? (Because it was relevant to my situation)   
Did I say something wrong?  Use a wrong word somewhere that is making people dislike what I have to say?  I just want to know so I can improve and learn.  Not knowing why means I can't correct my behavior of language if I'm doing anything wrong.    I goes up and down a lot, 30 one second,  38 the next and back and forth.  Maybe it's just normal human behavior in action and I'm overthinking it.   Would someone have told me if I said anything wrong?"
The_Wispy,asktransgender,"Is there such a thing as ""trans pride""?","Before this blows out of proportion or is seen in an offensive manner, I don't mean this in a negative way in the slightest.

Can a person really be ""proud"" of being trans? Or in the LGBT spectrum in general? I understand there is a certain pride we can have for being out and being ourselves, willing to face the world in hopes of a better future. But I don't feel like there is really any pride in being yourself or specifically in the activity of ""being trans"". It's just who we are, it wasn't really an active choice in my life to fall into this set of circumstances, so I don't feel pride in that regard, nor do I feel any shame in it. It's just a neutral ""that's life"" feeling. I do feel some pride over taking action over it however.

Am I reading too deep into this? Is this just a case of semantics?"

KingDe,asktransgender,"Having cross-dressing troubles, confused about self sexually; should I cross-dress? am I trans?","For the past years of my life I've been unsure if I've actually wanted to be a girl or just use woman's clothing as a fetish. When I was (12?) I stole some of my mother's clothing to wear, and as I recall there was nothing really sexually about it. I didn't know about tucking so I just wore panties and night gowns and hoped no one saw me. One day she found them but I wasn't wearing them and played them off as though they weren't mine (she probably knew but I never asked so who really knows.)

I've had in the past three years or so gigantic problems accepting myself as a sexual person (i.e., feeling okay for fantasizing about attractive women, sexualizing, wanting to be in a relationship for partially sexual purposes, wanting sex in general, etc.). I've also been dealing with a ton of depression that branches off in a way it would take me what seems like hours to go over every little nuance. In an attempt to help curb both I stopped watching born back in May and temporarily stopped masturbating, but somewhere along the line I had thoughts about cross dressing again, bought some panties online, and then never wore them afraid that they would affect my abstinence in someway (scared of just being autogynephilic) even if I didn't masturbate in them.

Eventually, a month later or so, I started having thoughts about them again and all the other ""girly"" things I had (socks and my cute purple hedgehog pajama pants &lt;3). It didn't go away even though I abstained from sexual pleasure. Eventually I broke and wore them and couldn't help myself, as I slept with them I awoke in the middle of the night to massive sexual arousal and couldn't help myself but to sexually please myself.

I've talked to a few people and everyone seems to have their different ways of dealing with sexual desire, but I'm just at a loss at what to do. I don't really feel as though my orgasms are worth the time so I think I'm going to try to be abstinent again, but at the same time I desperately want to wear my garments, but I know if I wear them I'll get a small erection and the desire will come, making it harder to do. If I do, I feel a bit of shame and disgust and want to get out of the clothes. I typically fight through it and wear them anyways (they're just more comfortable...) but the fact that I want to remove them at all worries me.

Am I repressing myself? Is this normal? I'm always back and forth on whether or not I may be trans... I only seem attracted to the girls I meet but if I'm having sexual pleasures I will swap between girls and boys. I was thinking that maybe it's really all a fetish but I saw a post somewhere where someone asked, ""If I was a woman doing my everyday things would I be happier?"" and when I think about it and all the little things I do that are portrayed as more feminine than masculine I'm overwhelmed with a positive emotion I can't really describe. It seems like a yes but like everything in my life nothing really seems to be 100%...

Can anyone help? I'm not asking for a life evaluation, I'm just really unsure what I'm doing and what would be healthiest for me..."

AgnosticThalassocnus,asktransgender,Do any of you experience your gender identity at a subconscious level rather than a conscious one?,"Here's the deal. I know that I am transgender, because I have the Gender Dysphoria to prove it. That said, I have never consciously identified as a man, woman, neither (Agender), or anything in between. All that I know for sure is that I **don't** identify as a man (I was AMAB) and I feel the most comfortable when I express femininely and am perceived by others as such. I pass, I fit conventional beauty standards, and I'm content with being labeled a woman by society, but I don't identify as such on a conscious level. It seems that I, like many Cis people claim, experience my gender identity on a subconscious level. I am me and for all I know I don't identify as a woman at all.

nate4ward,asktransgender,Tried dating/meeting and now I just feel terrible :'(,"Not exactly what you think, probably should have worded title differently. Anyways... some back story, I told my parents and sister about my desire to transition, and they are pretty much okay with it now, except I haven't told my younger brother yet (or any other relatives for that matter). Thus I have been pretty much been in the closet and can only get dressed up for like a few hours a night to help out with my dysphoria. I started taking some of the ""fake"" hormones a few weeks ago as well as starting to use the cream version of laser (which is working great so far), and with that Iv'e felt pretty confident with my face at least. So last night I took some pics and liked them so much that, genius me decided to make some dating profiles on different sites. I signed up for a couple of mtf transsexual oriented sites (the ones where the guys have to pretty much pay a premium), and I know that 99% of the people there are chasers but I feel thats what I am limited to. TBH I don't know what I was expecting, but when I got home from dinner, I checked my profiles. There were hundreds of likes and such (which honestly would not expect in a million years, and very flattering), but there were also dozens of guys that sent me very personalized heartfelt messages. These guys were soooo nice and some of them really attractive. So the problem is I just feel like a big liar. It's not that I doctored my photos or wore ten pounds of makeup. But I know there is a huge discrepancy in what I look like in boy mode and girl mode. I have to wear a wig because my hair is still harry potter- ish, when I shave  I have a 5' 0 clock shadow at noon. I listed my height 6-4 in my profile but it didn't exactly have an area to put very muscular hands and giant feet. I just feel like no matter what I do or say in my profile it will be a lie unless I post a pic of me in boy mode, a full body shot showing that I make Olympic weight lifters look small. I just really liked what some of these guys said and really want to to talk to them but like I said, I feel like I would just be starting off with a bunch of lies. I don't know if I should hang up on this idea and wait a couple years while my body is being fixed up, maybe continue on like I'm not doing something wrong, or basically say I'm all yours if you are into transgender women that look like big muscular dudes.

ligg-e-woo,asktransgender,"High Prolactin, Low E, Low T, what should I be asking Endocinologist?","Hey!

I live in Sweden and I have been on HRT since 28th December 2015.

I started with base values of:
18nmol/L T, 
3,3 U/L  FSH
2,2 U/L LH
102 mlE/L Prolactin
113 pmol/L E

I started with 137,5ug Estradot, 2 plasters a week and 50mg androcur daily.

By March I had constant headaches that were like migraines in strength, but a triptan did nothing to help with them. I was told to sink to 100ug Estradot, with the same 2 patches a week. 

They ordered a blood test 11th April 2016, it showed
less than 0,4nmol T
0,4 U/L FSH
less than 0,1 U/L LH
690 MIE/L prolactin
112 pmol E.

So to me it looked like I had unmesurable T, and that my extra eastrogen from the plasters was becoming prolactin.

I didn't recieve these blood test until 3 weeks ago, which is why I am asking about it now.

I was advised to try taking 1mg divigel instead of the estradot, which gave me no let up in the headaches, during this time I noticed that I was really thirsty (3-4 liters of fluid intake a day), had nose bleeds, dizzyness, dried milk on the ends of the nipples and occasional vision disturbances.

I was then advised to go down to 0,5mg divigel and this did nothing for the headaches either, so I stopped both the divigel and the androcur and around 1 week after I did that the headaches went away.

At the time I was on 0,5mg divigel I was down at 87pmol E, which is significantly lower than what my base was at.

I was told over the phone that they didn't know what was causing the problem, and as I didn't have any test results from them, my local doctors had their hands tied and couldn't find the cause either (they are not endocrinologists though!)

So, I started again at the end of May with 3mg divigel and 50mg androcur, I had already tried lowering the E dose, but not anything higher, so I thought, what the hell. I felt fine. I had that dose for 6 weeks without any problems. The next time endocrin called me, she told me off for taking so much, and said I was forbidden from taking more than 2mg divigel per day. There was no blood test taken when I was feeling better, despite me begging with her.

So, I went back to 2mg, and about 4 weeks later, at the start of August the headaches came back. She said to stop androcur and half the divigel to 1mg. I asked for a blood test first, she denied and said I must change the dose now, and then a blood test in 2 weeks. I actually thought back to my experiment with the hormones, and increased up to 2,5mg divigel and halved the androcur. 

They took blood again, 24th August 2016, for which I have incomplete data unfortunately... but prolactin was at 662.

When I got the bloodtests, I was immediately up to my local doctors, they tested me when I had been on 2,5mg divigel and 25mg androcur for about 6 weeks (27th Sept) and I had 552 Prolactin and 142 E.

So, what should I be asking my endocrin? I have tried since May to get a 2nd opinion, but without my doctors consent that is not happening. I was told no, based on endocrin not exhausting all possibilities, despite them doing nothing other than ignoring what I say with a dose I found worked better for me, and for not informing me of the high prolactin and low E.

I was denied a referal from my local doctors to my local endocrin because they don't deal with trans patients (could they not look at me as a woman, instead of trans? my values should be near to the female ranges right?)

I was denied a referal to a neurologist with my local doctors because they don't believe I have neurological problems.

I have currently been off work for 6 weeks because of the headaches that are back since 22nd September. As of 1st October I am on 2mg divigel and don't take androcur anymore. I read it can cause the higher prolactin. 

TL:DR

What should endocrin be doing to help me? I have had high prolactin and low E for months, and have severe headaches and other symptoms.

Local doctors say they are not competent to help me.

Referals are denied, and I have run out of ideas of who to ask.

I've been crossdressing for quite a while now, and I always feel good about myself as a girl.

treshizu,asktransgender,I can't figure myself out. Help please? (long-ish post),"I came here because my friends aren't able to offer an unbiased opinion and my mother threatened to kick me out if I tried to talk about it again. 


I'm sixteen, and I have been wondering whether I might be transgender, but I don't want to be one of those people who jumps onto this train just because they have weird interests or because they think that it's cool. I know that being transgender is not a fun thing, and it sure as hell is not something that you can figure out in a couple of months.


I was a pretty girly girl growing up. I didn't really have anything against dresses, skirts, or whatever. I didn't really think about it either, since my mom controlled what I would or would not wear. Nothing against being called a 'princess' either.


Throughout kindergarten and elementary school, I really wanted to play with the boys. Not because I was interested in whatever it was that they were playing, but just because they were boys, and I wanted to belong there, to be a part of that group.

Then we moved. Somewhere at the age of nine or ten, I learned that hey, gays and stuff exist. 


I started questioning my gender and I how I want to present myself at the age of 11-12. I didn't like having big breasts (i was really jealous of girls with flat chests), and didn't want people to think I was a girl, more so genderfluid. My body always looked weird and, in a sense, wrong, to me.


When I started going on online chatrooms, I had a male avatar and so people assumed that I was a boy. I was actually really happy about that for some reason.


About a year ago, a friend of mine suggested that I might be trans. Since then, I have been thinking about this every single day. I 'came out' to some of my friends, but I did say that my decision is nowhere near final.


I found ways to bind my chest and buy male clothing, despite my mothers disagreement. I like it, I really do, but I never sound sure when I think to myself 'Yes, I want to be a guy' or 'I want to be a girl'. There's always this weird feeling at the back of my throat.


Me wearing baggy clothes and the whole 'I want to be a guy' thing might be a self-esteem issue, and while I don't want it to be that, it would certainly be easier and would bring me way less trouble.


Mom found about it all, and she threatened to either off herself or kick me out as soon as I'm old enough and never speak to me again if I don't agree to look for a therapist and be 'cured' of these thoughts and just be a girl.
Since then, I doubt whether I am actually a guy (more than I did), but it's still there. I think about it every fucking day. I wish I didn't have to.


And it's always been easier to imagine myself as a male adult than a female one.


I want to be a man, but I feel like I'll never be a real one, and I've been getting irrational thoughts like 'your personality/behavior is not masculine enough therefore how can you take yourself seriously as one'. When I dress and introduce myself as male to people I don't know, I start worrying about so much stupid shit (Am I masculine enough? I don't look like a girl, right? Please don't see through me), and etc. etc.


I don't want to do shit I'm going to regret later. I'm risking alienating my mother and father for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure if I want to stay female.


Any advice?

Did I get deadnamed and outed as trans by the insurance software?

hookedOnOnyx,asktransgender,"2½ years in, still a lot of envy","whenever i see attractive women, either in real life or in media, I can't help but react with instant shame and grief at my own body and my own situation. I hate the objectification of women in media, but at the same time it sucks to have no value in that dimension at all. to be an invisible woman. it's not that the male gaze is valuable, it's the disparity in treatment.

I think my wife and i empathize a lot with each other; she's overweight, which puts her outside the bounds of societal acceptance, too. she feels invisible, too. she thinks I'm perfectly pretty, but I think she places a great deal of emphasis on my skinny body. but my height and face contribute to me getting mostly death glares from men (I'm relatively safe, being white and in southern California).

I usually get death glares; even when a guy does seem flirty, I wonder if they're just a chaser or a tall fetishist. and if I was single and even if I was attractive to some guy and straight, it would be incredibly unlikely to work out because of my anatomy. or because of my medical history.

I guess I'm just depressed at being in a lower caste, essentially, and seeing or being around women who don't know these struggles just keeps reopening these wounds. I don't like feeling resentful all the time. idk what to do about it, though. get over it, I guess. but consuming almost any media is really painful though. even when I'm having a good day it can catch me off guard. I don't know I'm just ranting yay.

I guess the tl;dr is I feel disgusted by my own body and seeing attractive women in media reinforces that disgust, and I resent being worthless as a woman, even though we're talking about society's vulgar measure of worth, just because of how I was born. life is unfair harrumph.

Animasta,asktransgender,learning to forgive yourself.,"I had a really intense therapy session today and I've been meditating on it for a while, I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar feelings:

Basically, my transition feels stuck in a rut, mostly because of things I'm not doing (I haven't bothered actually feminizing my voice at all, sticking to pants and woman t-shirts) and it's mostly because I feel like I can't work on it piece by piece, if it's not immediately perfect I'll feel like a failure. We tried to get to the reason today, and while I only had some vague ideas on the reasons (mostly to do with a recent job and a class I took in community college like 3 years ago) I remembered something that happened close to that class.

I was taking hormones probably 4-5 years ago, for 7-8 months. However, at that point I didn't have any money. Me and my family had no job because we were in Vegas during the recession, and the money from the inheritance we bought a house in Vegas ran out. Obviously, I had no way of getting money, so I stopped taking hormones.

Fast forward 3 years, we're out of Las Vegas, living in Portland, and me and my mom just got on the Oregon Health Plan; which covers HRT (and SRS, which is cool?). Now, this is 2014, probably around march of 2014, and I only restarted my transition in September of 2015. I wasted a year and a half doing nothing at all.

I've learned that I never forgave myself for either of those two instances. That's why I can't just practice my voice, realizing that it's going to be bad and embarrassing, or even wearing a dress outside of the house. I'm scared of failure because I never forgave myself for stopping the hormones and for taking so long to get back on them. But you know what? That's not helpful to me. Like, I have to get over it. All I'm doing by not doing anything is just continuing to feel uncomfortable with my body. Making progress, however slight, will help with that.

I just wondered if anyone else still hates themselves, a little or a lot, for, say, stalling on hormones. Or some other mistake you made during your transition."
Arachnifty,asktransgender,Should I (25F) feel terrible that part of the reason I don't want to keep dating a guy (26M) is because he has a vagina?,"So, I work with this guy Darren (not his real name). He has had a crush on me for a very long time and has been pretty vocal about it but I was in a relationship up until 3 months ago. Shortly after I broke up with my ex, Darren asked me out on a date. We clicked really well and I very much enjoyed spending time with him. He was cool with taking things A LOT slower than I'm used to, and I felt relaxed when I was with him. He's a lot smaller and less muscular than the guys I usually go out with and to be honest I wasn't as physically drawn to him as I have been to other men, but I decided I should try it out anyway and found that I really like him as a person which is all that matters ultimately. 

We'd been going out for almost two months and were facebook official by the time we had sex for the first time (like I said, taking it VERY slow sexually). He took his pants off and I was surprised to find that he had a vagina. He hadn't told me he was trans. He acted a little sheepish and in truth I was annoyed because I feel like you should mention that kind to your girlfriend before it becomes a surprise during the first time in bed. I'm also decidedly not into vaginas. I didn't want to shame him for it or be a transphobe though so I was like ""ok, self, get over it! You really like this guy!"". The sex that transpired (strap-on in me, and mutual oral) was not satisfying for me, though Darren seemed to enjoy himself. To be honest eating him out was very unpleasant and the whole time I wished I was sucking a big dick instead. The strap-on was also not very fun for me. 

I brought up the fact that he hadn't told me he was trans and at first he claimed that he had (citing VERY vague references he'd made a while ago to being ""queer"" that I'd construed as meaning he was bisexual). Ultimately he apologized but was still rather defiant about it. 

For the past month I've REALLY tried to make it work for me in bed with him but it just doesn't. I don't find him any less attractive but just the physical act doesn't do it for me. I'd liken it to being with a man who's got a very small penis, or a curved penis, or even if a woman with a small vagina was with a man with giant penis: his genitalia is not working for me. Felatio is very important for me during sex, I really enjoy pleasing a guy orally and I want it to be a big part of my sex life. I don't enjoy eating out though, and sucking on a dildo hasn't been good either. I think it would be the same if I was with a guy who just really hated blowjobs and didn't want me to give them to him. 

I'm very close to breaking it off with Darren, even though I really care for him, because I just don't enjoy sex with someone who has a vagina. From what I've seen and read though,that makes me incredibly transphobic and terrible. I don't think of myself as a transphobe at all! I'm generally an ally and I feel AWFUL about this I wish so badly I could just MAKE myself be into the sex. 

Does this make me a terrible person? 
What's the kindest way to break things off?
Do I tell him that I'm breaking up because I can't be sexually happy with someone who has a vagina, or should I lie?
How can I make sure it doesn't hurt him greatly when I break things off? 
Literally any advice or insight would be so appreciated.

I'm actually a foreigner presenting ""male"" and I already need to hear people, almost everyday, telling me ""Oh you're tall !!"". But, screw me, I want to actually transition and except turning very feminine, I think it will be very hard for me to just go on with my life without everybody staring at me in profound shock (no kidding).

Throwawayzztop,asktransgender,"Periods of feeling like I'm not transgender, or am I just repressing everything a lot.","Ive been thinking about gender issues for many years now and ive come to accept that I basically am transgender. All I have to do is tell my parents and I can start and ill probably have good support and good results. I want to do this, but every time I get close to being able to tell them I start to get scared, and I begin to have negative thoughts and feelings, I begin to think that i could never be transgender, the thoughts of being transgender came from someone else. And I begin to think that all other transgender people are freaks. I know this isn't true and that I really would like to transition but whenever the time comes close to when ill see my parents again or decide once again its time to tell them I get those negative thoughts. And even though rationally i know telling them will be better i cant because in that moment i feel like its not a real problem.

Maybe I need to be able to fully accept my self first, maybe I cant tell them because i dont accept myself as being transgender.

[deleted],asktransgender,How do I deal with transition and (excessive) weight loss/loose skin? (Definite trigger warning),"Okay, as of late this has sort of been consuming me. Once I realized that I could possibly be trans two years ago I decided to lose weight. I was not too sure how much I had weighed then, but last December I was around 230-40 pounds at the time. At my worst, I had to say I was pushing close to 300. I had packed it all on back in my freshman year of high school, and have carried it for a decade and a half ever since.

Anyways, over the course of the last year I've slimmed down to around 168 pounds. I'm now down to a size 30 in men's; No women's clothes yet due to lack of funds. Plus, I had to get clothes that actually fit for work. However, the toll that all those years spent living like that are evident. I've got stretch marks galore. They're all over my stomach, love handles, back, under arms, thighs, knees, and under my boobs. At least I am glad to have a head start there, other than that this absolutely sucks.

The absolute worse thing has to be the loose skin. Without my glasses on (I'm myopic) it looks tolerable. Yet when I slide those on the skin on my abdomen turns into a pruned, moldy potato. The other day I actually broke down and cried in front of the mirror. There isn't anything I can really do about it short of a tummy tuck, and there is no way I'd be able to scrounge the money for that in the near future.

I think I can live with the stretch marks, but the fact that I need surgery to correct the loose skin horrifies me. Transitioning alone has so many hypotheticals. Adding a tuck to that, well, it just leaves me feeling defeated. This ordeal even had me contemplating suicide the other day, but that's NOT an option.

Basically what I'm trying to ask is how do I deal with this? Will this ever get better? Has anyone here had the procedure done (MtF, FtM or NB?)? Are you satisfied with the results? How has it changed your life?

I'm mortified just thinking I'm always going to be alone. I can literally count the times I've ever been intimate with another person on one hand. Being formerly fat is one thing, but add the fact that I'm trans? I feel like I'm royally fucked. I'll be nothing more than a creepy leper, and I blame myself for letting it get to this point.

Anyways, I'm sorry for the rant. I've just been so angry with the world as of late. I've been angry with myself. I'm angry with my parents. I'm tired of feeling miserable for the past week. I don't want to go to work tonight. I'm tired of the constant sirs. I hate how I don't even have cash for laser. I hate that my life has to be put on hold until I can somehow fix this through something short of a miracle or divine intervention. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. It hurts too damn much.

Again, I apologize for this. I just needed to vent. I just don't know what to do, and I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. So, I'm going to crawl up in a ball and get a nap before work. That usually takes the edge off, but right now I just want some hope. Are there any suggestions on what I can do?"
Needs_Better_Friends,asktransgender,I'm pretty sure I'm transgender. Now what?,"After thinking about it for the past year or so, I've come to the conclusion that I'm some where on the trans spectrum. I'm pretty sure I'm just MTF, but there's a chance I could be some form of non-binary. But that's not very likely. 

With this information, what should I do next? How should I go about mentally preparing myself for being trans, finding out whether or not I want to transition, and transitioning if I decide I want to?

For reference, I won't be able to come out to anyone, make myself look like a girl in public, or start transitioning until I'm 18 and move away from the hell on Earth that is the south. I'm also probably not going to be able to experiment with cross dressing or make up any time soon, unless I'm able to get a job.

susanking1956,asktransgender,I reduced my monthly HRT prescriptions from $70 to $28.,"In June 2016, when I bought my first HRT prescription, I paid $70.00 for a monthly supply. I thought $70 was not too bad. Its the cost of 1 hour with my electrologist.

My monthly prescription is:
$53.00 - 60 tabs of 100mg Spironolactone (2/day)
$ 9.00  - 60 tabs of    2mg Estradiol (2/day)
$ 8.00 -  30 tabs of    5mg Finasteride
$70.00  TOTAL

Well, yesterday I found an additional saving that reduced my monthly prescription down to $28.00. Its a $42.00 per month savings or a 60.0% reduction.

Now my monthly prescription is:
$20.00 - 60 tabs of 100mg Spironolactone (2/day)
$ 4.00  - 60 tabs of    2mg Estradiol (2/day)
$ 4.00 -  30 tabs of    5mg Finasteride
$28.00  TOTAL


How did I do this. I read an article about Sams pharmacy offering Finasteride at no cost for Sams Club Plus members. So I went buy the pharmacy to ask them about this. They told me that the State of Georgia does not allow them the sell Finastride at no cost. I gave them my prescription and the total monthly cost was $28.00. I saved $156.00 per year ($13.00*12 months).

However the Sams Club Plus card cost $100.00 per year. The $156.00 saving more that offset the cost of the card. Then I found a Groupons coupon that allows me to buy an annual Plus card for only $45.00 plus they will give me a $5.00 Sams gift card and rotisserie chicken.

So in 5 months, I was able to reduce my monthly medicine cost for less than $40.00 for the Sams Plus card and now I have access to the lower priced gas and food.

Gialicious,asktransgender,Misgendered (at Target) so randomly it smacks me in the face...,"TL;DR: Target employees have randomly misgendered me 3 times now and it hurts my feelings and makes me feel sad/angry/disgusted. Its getting to be unbearable.

I guess I'm posting this looking for support. I don't want to complain but I need to get this off my chest.
I'm a 29yo MTF. I've been full time for close to a year and on hormones for 6 months. I work in a corporate office in a fairly big city in very liberal state. Without going into a description on my appearance, I will just say I am very feminine and I am rarely misgendered, whether it be in person or on the phone.

Unfortunately while I live 95% of my life as a female, 5% random times I am misgendered as a male... specifically at Target which is just a block down the street from my office (the only target I have accessible to me as I don't drive). Once a female cashier said ""he needs the price checked on this hair dryer"" to her coworker. Yesterday a janitor asked me to move so he could access an outlet for a floor cleaner and after I said sorry he said ""No worries bro"". And today the cashier said ""hey man"". As a point for how infuriating this is aside from being incredibly random, today I was literally wearing a blouse and mini skirt, heels, jewelry, makeup and my hair was down. How in the F*** are you seeing a man?? (putting all offensive gender stereotypes aside I realize men can wear all of these things but I also have BREASTS that are pretty obvious in my blouse). 

So basically what to do? How do I deal? Should I email the target store manager and complain? Should I just take it as society being dumb sometimes? Usually this stuff rolls off my back but right now im sitting here stewing.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the feedback and suggestions on how to handle Target. "

But the longer I'm away from people the more doubts I started to experience. Am I sure? What if I don't actually mind being a girl all that much? Maybe I shouldn't have told them cause I think I'm wrong. Today I woke up and I was like, ""Dude, you fucked up.""

Tessa-Raider,asktransgender,"MTF HRT, No Plan on Transitioning :/","I've been on MTF HRT for eighteen months now and have no plans of transitioning. Anyone else in the same boat? 

Prior to HRT my life was absolutely miserable despite the fact of having five beautiful children, two successful careers and a booming business. I was 48 years old and   knew something (big) just wasn't right with my life and I always knew I was transgender. 

HRT has enabled me to have a quality of life I never thought possible. I was finally comfortable in my own skin! Depression, gone ! Moodiness, gone! Suicidal thoughts, gone! I finally found the missing piece of the puzzle that led to my ever escaping happiness. 

So, I have gone through all the changes HRT brings to ones life. Diminishing muscle mass, smoother skin, more feminine appearance, breasts and much more. The biggest and most significant change of all has been in my mental well-being. 

I am a super sensitive person and realized early on that there was no way I had the intestinal fortitude to make the transition. Call me what you want but I am just not capable of transitioning. I am 6'3"", built like a football player, handsome as a man but not so much as a female. So I have made the decision to still present as male. Tremendous respect points goes out to my sisters who have felt the joys and pains of actually transitioning. 

The physical changes have not made it hard though the size of my growing breasts are concerning me. Definitely rockin the ""Man-Boob"" look. To date I have had no negative comments from strangers. Some family member have noticed my shaved legs and tease me somewhat. 

There is no way I could ever go back to the ""Dark Side"" and will continue on my path with a huge smile on my face. I wanted to throw this out there in case there is any others in my position. We all feel differently as to what we want and need. I need and want to be happy. MTF HRT was the final missing piece and the answer for me. "

I also have been reading that it makes many girls gain weight. This would definitely be an undesirable side effect as I'm already more plump than I'd like to be at the moment.

At one point, my ex even told me that she couldn't feel me inside her anymore and honestly I've been very depressed because of this shrinkage. It's not an ego thing, it just pisses me off that I can't have normal fucking genitals like everyone else. Why couldn't I just be born with a vagina in the first place? And if I HAD to be born with a dick, why couldn't it just stay a normal size that works for sex? And I know I could get SRS but by the time I'm even 18 and can get the procedure, there probably won't be much there to work with and my neovagina would be 2 inches deep. Also, I honestly find the concept somewhat dumb. I don't mean to disrespect any women who get SRS, we all do what we feel like we need to do to be comfortable with our bodies and some people have major genital dysphoria and SRS helps them with that. That's fine, but a neovagina and a natural vagina aren't exactly the same. A neovagina won't make me biologically female, it doesn't matter how much I want it to. So I guess my choices are having a tiny penis, going off hormones and having a normal penis in a body that doesn't feel like my own or an inverted dick I can try to delude myself into calling a vagina. I've been feeling very unsexy and ugly because of all this and even though I'm very happy that I transitioned, I've just been very depressed about the fact that I'm even trans to begin with. So I guess all I want is to know if anybody else feels the same way, I've never heard other trans women talk about this and feeling less alone would be nice. "

Chickahblah,asktransgender,Feeling pretty disheartened about my voice training,"So I had some voice therapy sessions, and at the end of my second (of what was supposed to be like ten) the doc told me that she can't justify me coming after this.  She said she thinks my voice is fine and we measured my voice at 190hz, so within 'female' levels.  However, I really am not very happy with it.  I have this horrible feeling that she was basically saying that she doesn't think she can improve it more, you know?

So, does voice training improve your voice over the long run?  I've only been practicing and using my voice regularly for about two months.  I feel like I've hit a wall.  Does it get better?

I plan to sit down my mother, father, and brother alongside my girlfriend and tell them that I have wanted to live as a female my whole life but have been suppressing myself for fear of judgement. This fear has seemed insurmountable until recently when my girlfriend has been giving my wonderful emotional support and even letting me try on a lot of her clothes. I really believe I can overcome my fears and become a confident woman but not without learning to do so myself. That said, I have been asking various trans women, how did you gain the confidence over time? and, what was it like to come out to your parents as trans?

I can't come out or transition for a multitude of reasons. It's shitty but it's my situation right now... everyone thinks I'm a queer cis woman and that's how it will probably stay for a while.

Anyway, my problem is that I go to an extremely liberal and social justicey school where a group of trans- and LGB- phobic assholes will be protesting an event related to trans rights. I volunteered to organize a counterprotest, giving up my own time out of an incredibly busy schedule to do this.
6 hours later some SJWs are subtweeting me for being ""cis"" while running the counterprotest and making an LGB related joke that erases trans people or something. I'm basically getting cyberbullied by a bunch of 20 year olds acting like middle schoolers because of an incorrect assumption about my gender identity. It's multiple levels of fucked up, but my reputation is getting destroyed.

I'm hoping y'all might be able to offer some rational advice- nobody wants to take this job over, people will be mad at me if the counterprotest doesn't happen, these people are stressing me out with the knowledge of what they do socially to people who offend them (you would be surprised at how bad they fucked over a guy who was wrongly accused of rape last year), and for my own safety I cannot come out or transition.

Like the other day I was at the hospital getting a minor procedure done and after they called me up some lady said to my mum ""is that your daughter? She looks sad."". The only problem is that the whole time I was in the waiting room I had part of my face obscured by my hand. The other time came later as was in the second waiting room. A nurse came and stood about 2 meters away from me and looked me in the eye and asked ""are you Victoria?"" but again I had my face partially obscured by a blanket.

driku12,asktransgender,"Is there anyone on here who is transgender and practices mindfulness or detachment of any kind? Please help, I'm so confused!","I'm a 20 year old person who, for the past few years, has been coming to terms with the fact that I might be transgender (MTF). All of my life I've gone through one form of depression or another. I've had anger issues, been suicidal, extreme anxiety, you name it, but whenever I think of transitioning or I wear my makeup and ""girl"" clothes, I feel truly happy, like I'm really being ""me"" and there is nothing in the world that could ruin it.

There's only one thing. 

To combat my anxiety when I can't dress like my true self (which is like five days a week), I practice mindfulness meditation. It's the only thing that works for me to stop anxiety attacks before they start and keeps me fairly even-keeled. However, lately, these two nuggets of joy, the mindfulness and my recent realization, have been conflicting with each other and causing me a fair bit of strife.

The comfort from mindfulness comes from the subjectivity of reality and surpassing your own desires and thoughts of ""good"", ""bad"", and other societal structures in order to find relative peace in the neutrality of everything. However, whenever I indulge in my transsexual lifestyle, it is bothering me because it feels like a weakness. I know the concepts of gender as we know them, wearing makeup and dresses and shit and wanting breasts and a vagina instead of pecks and a penis is all, in the end, entirely pointless, like everything else, but I can't seem to overcome it. I feel... well, I feel like I felt before I even found mindfulness in the first place. Defective. ""Shame on me, it's all in my head, if I was a real human being of worth I would suck it up and keep on chugging along like all of the other people in the world that have it infinitely worse than me and yet keep doing exactly that,"" I hear in the back of my head.

I just... if there's anyone else on here who has any experience with philosophical or spiritual matters or has ever faced a similar question... what's the point? How can I be true to what I know I have to do and yet somehow be detached from myself at the same time? How do I control my actions and understand the world around me when I'm faced with impulses I can't control and things I don't understand?

It's all just so... confusing... &lt;:'("

Chaojidage,asktransgender,Why didn't anyone think of this solution to the transgender bathroom issue?,"First of all, the best solution is that public facilities and stores should add some family restrooms or private ones that lock, like the ones at gas stations. Everyone's safety would be accounted for, and transgender people can use the same bathroom.

If this cannot be done, then this is the next-viable alternative, which is a decent compromise but not perfect:

A law can say that everyone must go to the bathroom matching the legal gender (e.g. on a driver's license), and you actually have to go to court to change that. At court, they actually need evidence of being transgender to change the legal gender, so it's harder for, say, a man pretending to be a woman to enter a women's bathroom, because he know he will get caught without legal support. Passable transgender people with unmatching legal genders shouldn't mind this policy because nobody is going to suspect them anyway. (This is the reality of law and order, and this law would be designed to take advantage of this.) If someone get's suspected, local authorities should have the power to treat each case *individually* to work out the best solution for each person. This is real inclusivity without infringing on others' safety, and it is a decent and practical step towards progress in transgender equality and the consideration of everyone's feelings and safety.

Someone pointed out that going to court would be a hassle, and this is why, if unisex, single-user bathrooms can't be built, a more efficient way of establishing one's identity as transgender can be developed. This is really the most considerate compromise *if* single-user bathrooms cannot be built.

However, the whole point of the above plan addresses the practical possible solutions *if* public bathrooms for men and women are not replaced by unisex bathrooms. I personally do not endorse the plan, as it is in essence an exception to the solution of private bathrooms, and do not know why anyone would make it so complicated. However, there is a real and rising concern that the cost of building unisex bathrooms would be unbearable to the government and businesses, and this belief is unwarranted. Not only would unisex bathrooms benefit transgender people, but it would also benefit the disabled and those with babies, and it would also lower the *risk* of sexual assault and the *alarm* of concerned bathroom users who do not and cannot realize that sexual assault rates have actually not increased due to inclusive transgender bathroom policies, like that of Target."

Futurist110,asktransgender,Did any transfeminine people here get fake balls after orchiectomy?,"Basically, what I am wondering about is if any transfeminine (in a broad sense) people here have gotten fake balls (testicular implants) after they got an orchiectomy (for whatever reason).

Indeed, after I will get an orchiectomy (which is certainly something that I want to do but unfortunately can't afford yet), I will seriously consider getting fake balls (in large part because this might make sex more familiar to my future female sexual partners). Also, for the record, I am MAAB and still mostly identify as a male (though the term ""man"" gives me some dysphoria) but also want to strongly feminize both my body and my face as well as to cross-dress sometimes.

Frankly, I suspect that this desire on my own part might be unusual for transfeminine people; however, I especially want to hear about the experiences of transfeminine people in regards to this due to the fact that I myself lean more to the feminine than to the masculine side of gender expression.

Of course, the opinions of trans-men are certainly also welcome here. :) Indeed, I simply feel that trans-men's experience in regards to this might be a bit different from my own planned experience in regards to this.

ThrownAwayTransGirl,asktransgender,"Hips Recently ""Masculinized"" Even Though I'm Still on HRT? :(","I'm just so done. I was going to write a longer post that detailed all of the changes to my hips, but it got eaten and now I know that I won't end up posting this unless it's just a short blurb about the fact that this happened. 

I don't even really see how it's possible for this to have happened, but my levels have not once been tested since like 2011 when I first got an endo, and I don't even know what the numbers were, so it's possible that I've just had high testosterone and/or low estrogen for a long time and I just didn't know it. Which would explain why I'm so ugly despite being an ""early transitioner"". But the one thing I don't really understand is why this only happened now. I did switch from sublingual to oral pills back in January, and it could be that I'm not getting enough E, but if that's the case, then why did my hip bones only start hurting recently? Wouldn't I have noticed back in January or at least sometime between then and now? And if my T levels are suddenly higher, why haven't I started growing facial hair or getting acne or something? It seems like this could all just be psychosomatic when I put it that way, but I can't really ignore my own eyeballs.

I just want to know... If I get my levels tested and it turns out that they're at normal levels for a cis woman my age... Does it mean that this really was psychosomatic? Because it should be impossible for this to happen if your T levels are way down, right? And your E levels are around 375? If it turns out my levels are somewhere around there, it's impossible for something like this to have happened, right? And your bones aren't supposed to fuse until you're 18 to 23, so it's not like they could have fused before I started hormones, and I KNOW they were different just a little while ago, so I'm just... Confused and frustrated. 

I've tried for weeks to get my levels tested, but it's just so hard to deal with medical stuff. I tried to call my insurance right now to see who my primary care physician is, but I waited too long and now I have to wait till Monday and my hips might be even worse by then. And then who knows how long it will take before my endo can adjust the dosage according to what my levels actually are, it might be as long as a month. 

I've been taking more hormones than usual to try to alleviate things, but I don't know if it's really doing anything, and now I have to buy more hormones online, because obviously they won't refill my script until it's ""time"" to refill. I'm usually on 100mg spiro and 6mg E, but like I said, I take the estrogen orally instead of sublingually, which is supposed to be worse (and pills are supposed to be worse than injections anyway). I've been trying to take them sublingually again as of late, but I don't know if it's better or worse to do that when the pills aren't the same as before. The round pills dissolved much more easily and evenly than these.

If I do get my levels tested and everything really is okay, then I'll accept this was all in my head. But I have a bad feeling that something is wrong. "

I've had various professional salon workers try to make me over, and even then I only look like a transvestite. I've tried, I have. I've been on hormones for years. Almost no change.

I've been told for a long time that I am handsome - handsome as a man. But not like this. Before I came out, I was ready to go to college, to be a comedian, hoping to live out my life and die without ever addressing that horrible constant feeling that I needed to be female.

Since I came out, I'm scared to even be seen anymore. I quit college. I don't have any friends. I stay inside every day, all day, hurting myself, telling myself over and over that I should kill myself. There is nothing left of the hopeful person I used to be.

Sometimes I think that maybe it would be better if I just gave up, and tried being a guy again. But it's been years. Everyone I still know refers to me as a woman, and it was a hard-fought battle to get them to do so. The idea of taking back my 'transness' and what that will cause everyone to think... It makes me want to die.

I can't go on like this. I don't want to. I'm scared and I don't know what other options I have left besides a wasted life or suicide.

I don't want to die. I just don't see a way out of this. Please, someone tell me what to do. 

EDIT: Thank you for all the helpful advice and personal stories. I think I'm a bit more stable, now."

komatteru,asktransgender,Booked an appointment with a therapist. What can I do in the meantime?,"Hi everyone. Using a throwaway because I know at least one person in my area identified me from my main and I'm not ready to be public about this just yet.

I'm AMAB and questioned my gender identity for a long time - went to speak to people about it when I was a teenager but I barely knew myself as a person at that time so I stopped - plus I didn't feel ""chop off my dick"" dysphoria, and I thought it was a zero-sum game at that point and felt guilty for wasting people's time. I wish I had been honest about that now, but I guess I'm still young.

I'm living in a new country now and recently these feelings have been flooding back (I felt happy enough living as a gay man for a few years, though maybe it's telling that I basically actively avoided seeing other guys, I guess I just buried my feelings for a while), so I went to a nearby mental health clinic (non-specialised but the lady didn't seem like they were completely unequipped to handle this so that's reassuring) to make an appointment, but it's basically a month's wait.

Maybe I'm just frustrated because I did this today and I was hoping to be seen sooner, but I'm kind of feeling really down now. What should I do to alleviate this stress while I wait? I was invited to a Halloween party tomorrow but I barely want to go now (not just because of this - it's been a nightmare finding decent facepaint, and I have a work thing from like 7 tomorrow which involves children so I doubt they want to see me still drunk from the night before, face paint smeared and sunglasses on to stop people seeing my red eyes lol), and I'm just feeling really crap, you know?

TL;DR: Made an appointment with therapist, it's going to be a month's wait, feeling crappy, what do I do to not feel crappy?"
kegzdi,asktransgender,Do any other MtFs still workout?,"So I'm like two weeks short of a full year on hormones.  I see no changes really and am kind of getting the mindset that if i do try to go full time ill always look ridiculous and get not just clocked, but straight up called out.  All that being said, for the first probably 9-10 months of my time on hormones, i didnt workout more than just cardio, in attempts to lose muscle mass and maybe not look so overtly masculine.  Well its become apparent that thats not the case, nor will it ever be, without a ton of surgical work, surgical work I will not be able to afford.  I am going to continue to take hormones because they personally make me feel phenomenal,  but thats besides the point. The mental changes alone are worth it many many times over for me...

But to the point of the post...  I've started crossfit and am loving it!  I love pushing myself to live healthier and to accomplish things.  I am doing this at the medically prescribed female standards for crossfit, so as to not ""bulk"" and am seeing my body get lean and look healthier.  I still have clearly defined muscles, but its not ur ""typical"" male muscle.

So does anyone else still workout to some degree? Whats ur routine, results, and mindset??? "
Arduinan,asktransgender,GCS Update (6 days post-op),"Part 1: https://m.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/54s9i6/i_just_had_gcs_3_hours_ago_ama_d/

Part 2: https://m.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5585oi/i_had_gcs_3_days_ago_update/

I went to Dr. McGin's office this morning for the first followup visit (6 days post-op).  She put my feet in stirrups and removed a few stitches that were there to keep my thighs together until this point. Then she slowly pulled/unravelled the packing.  That's definitely a weird feeling as  everyone says, like tickling inside but not painful.  Then she pulled the catheter out all at once, which actually wasn't that bad. 

Then I got to see everything for the first time.  Up until now I had been so happy just seeing a smooth mound down there instead of things sticking out.  When I saw an actual vulva in the mirror, I was just amazed.  It was like magic, so much more natural looking than I expected, with genuine labia and everything.  I was almost glad I've been without estrogen for 3 weeks because otherwise I would have been crying the whole time with emotion.

Dr. McGinn explained each part. The inciscions looked mostly healed except for the visible stitches, and weren't red or swollen at all.  Then she checked my depth and showed me how to dilate by dipping the dilator under the pubic bone gently and slowly pushing to maximum (which for me was 1 dot left completely outside me).  It takes more force to hold it there than I thought it would but there was no pain at all (though I'm still on vicodin).  She warned me to always let them slide out slowly/on their own so it doesn't make a vacuum. 

So we went back to GAIA where I drank a lot of fluids so I could pee.  If you can't pee by 3pm, the catheter goes back in.  I was so relieved when I went, but as expected it sprays now instead of a stream. It felt the same as going before surprisingly.

So I guess this might be the last update for a while now that dilation will be happening 5 times a day unless something goes wrong.  Thanks everyone for the kind thoughts."
Readysetindigo,asktransgender,AMAB non-binary ...help,"Hello all,

I've been enjoying switching back and forth between boy mode and girl mode for several months now, and was convinced HRT was the next step for me. I found a very kind doctor and therapist and I began estradiol and spiro under their supervision. However, I quickly descended into intense hormonal mood swings and panicked because, although I want softer skin and a rounder face to give me a more andro look, the idea of adding breasts to my body freaks me out. At this point, I'm working towards transitioning socially into a more femme genderfluid expression, but can't shake the haunting feeling that I will regret not taking the hormones later, even though the emotional effects made me feel like I was dying and I don't want breasts.

My question: will binding while on mtf hormones stunt breast growth? If so, this may be an option for me. Also, for anyone who experienced crippling mood swings, did they ever subside?

Thank you all, I'm very confused about who I am and just need some ideas. I want to prevent further masculinization without extreme feminization :/"
Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Any other lucid dreamers here?,"I really should be dreaming right now instead of sitting in front of the computer, but I was wondering whether there are any other lucid dreamers here. I started in early childhood and got a pretty good handle by age ten or so, but whenever I told someone before I transitioned people either thought I was kidding or treated me like some weird mystic. Then I transition and have met a couple other lucid dreamers at support group. Julia Serano also has written that she is a lucid dreamer, though I wish she'd said more about her experience. I personally found it really helpful for mapping out my internal body image and trying out what parts of transition felt comfortable. Kind of wish I could do some dream yoga, but I don't know the right positions and keep forgetting to experiment.

Anyway, I thought I might open a discussion, as it seems that it hasn't come up here for a couple years, and I curious about others' experiences. I have some more to share if there's interest.

For those who want to learn, hopefully others will be more helpful than I am with advice: what worked for me in developing the practice was repeating mantras of awareness while I was falling asleep. The fact that writing and clocks change every time you look at them (aargh when contracts appear in dreams!) can help you recognize you're dreaming, as can developing a habit of questioning yourself while awake."

throwaway4fun200,asktransgender,What are some questions you've been asked that made you reflect on being trans? Especially if they weren't directly gender related.,"Background: I'm MtF pre everything, still 100% boymode, only out to my family and therapist.

I moved to a different state a few months ago and while I was interviewing for jobs I got one question a couple of times that really gave me pause. The interview had moved past my professional qualifications and on to the part where they ask you questions that make you think and see how you react. I got the obligatory strengths/weaknesses question, which I failed at miserably. Right after that, though, one of the interviewers asked, ""If you could change anything about yourself, what would you change?""

I paused for a second, thinking, well......... um......... my gender!

I didn't get that job (I've got a better job now, so it all worked out), but that question made me laugh a bit after the interview was over. I shared the story with my family and my therapist and they all had a good laugh too.

I'm only part-time, about 7 months in to HRT (MtF), not passable in person and I definitely wouldn't pass on the phone if I were to call them, so I really don't know what to do. This person was a good friend of mine years ago, but we drifted apart when I moved away. From what I can tell they lean towards conservative values, so it's within the realm of possibility that they wouldn't even be okay with someone like me.

I'm not sure what I'm even asking here, I'm just really nervous and don't know what to do. I need to reply soon though otherwise it's going to look like I'm ignoring them. Maybe some of you have been in a situation like this and could offer advice? I could really use the help.

throwaway334551,asktransgender,[29/F] Am I just more masculine than other women? Sometimes I wish my body to be different. I am confused,"Growing up I can recall many instances I wanted to be a boy (I even remember some time before puberty I felt like my clit was getting bigger and hoped for a while that it would grow into a penis). And often I would like to be flat-chested (although, being attracted by men, I am happy my tits are attractive to them).

I grow up in a very open minded family and I had no problem whatsoever being a tomboy and dress how I wanted. At high school time I used to dress in a way that frequently led people to identify me as male, and while I would not say I was one (like, I would give me birth-name, not some masculine alternative) I always enjoyed them making this mistake.

Now it has been years since I started dressing in a way that is not extremely feminine, but that doesn't hide my body shape (sadly my bust is quite big), and all the people I had known in the time I was more male-looking are very distant from where I live. I think that having known me at that time makes my interactions with them pretty gender-neutral regardless of how I dress now.

I don't suffer tremendously for me being now easily identifiable as female, but I know that if the transition was just somebody pointing a magic wand at me and giving me a male body, I'll almost certainly go for it.

Recently I have started thinking about binding my bust and trying to go back to my old masculine style, just this time going all the way into giving a masculine (or at least ambiguous) name. I don't think it could comfortably work in the summer, though. I would like to properly try being a man, and I know that I would like to be one, but would I like it so much as to do drastic changes in my life?

My problem with that is that I am still only attracted by men, so probably as far as sex life goes I would be better off getting more feminine :-/ 
On top of that, I read that FTM experience increased sex drive, and my sex drive in a couple of occasion has already almost drove me crazy. Luckily is not a continuous thing, just some rare occurrences when I am strongly attracted by a specific person, but I am afraid of the effects of being even more violently attracted by someone while at the same time lowering my chances of them wanting me.

Thanks for the patience to read through all of this. I realize that for most people these issues include much more struggling... If I had a stronger drive to transition I would probably not feel the need to write here, so maybe I should just continue with my life and not question myself much... at the same time, stuff like this comes back in my mind over and over, and I wonder if there is something I could try to do to be less confused about it."

throwawayTG13,asktransgender,I identify as male but I have a clear feminine side. Am I trans?,"I'm comfortable with my male body, never once felt ""wrong"". I am also not attracted to other men. But I have a HUGE fetish for trans women and trans erotica. 

I experimented with dressing up and makeup in my teens but nothing since. I am now 42, married with kids.

In a lot of ways I am an atypical man. I get turned on by seduction and erotica, but straight up porn either disgusts me or does nothing. I don't like the typical macho stuff like cars and sports, preferring quiet hobbies like reading and building scale models.

From what I understand a chaser is a person who want to be with a trans person only because they are trans, or at least being trans is an important factor. Well for me it is an important factor, but that doesn't mean it's the only thing I care about or I only want them for sex. I really want to make a family.

About sex, I'm versatile and definitely want to top and bottom. I don't know how that plays into me being a chaser because I've seen some people basically say that if you're a man who has any interest in bottoming to a trans woman then you're a chaser.

stygianZinogre_,asktransgender,How to not be so isolated?,"A lot of this ended up kind of venting more than anything, but if anyone has any advice I'd definitely take it.

I feel extremely alone. I really haven't got any friends nearby - my only friends are online, and even then I've only got 3. Two of them only know I'm trans because an abusive ex told them without my knowledge, and I don't know if the other knows at all - I don't think my ex told them, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and I can't exactly ask without outing myself.  It's not something I like talking about 99.999% of the time. Although those two friends have been great and nothing but supportive, and even though they don't act like it's something that affects their opinion of me, it's still just not something that I like them knowing about.

I feel like it's irrelevant. Or it should be irrelevant. It doesn't define my personality. I can't stand the idea of people making assumptions about me because of it. Assuming anything about my personality, interests, hobbies, opinions, political affiliations, ESPECIALLY assuming anything about what my body looks like, looked like in the past, or will look like in the future. I don't know if this means I have internalized transphobia or something. But I just want people to think of me as just... an ordinary guy. Without any qualifiers or modifiers attached to that statement.

So I don't like talking about it with the friends I currently have, but there's still sometimes that I feel like I need to talk about it.  This looks like a new account, but I've actually had two in the past, that I was active for a while but then ended up thinking ""I never want to think about being trans again"" and deleted all my posts and the account.  I started HRT, getting my name and gender marker and everything legally changed soon, the last major hurdle is figuring out how to pay for surgery that insurance doesn't want to cover - I'm transitioning, I might be able to put the whole thing behind me one day and not need to think about it, but I guess I can't do that just yet. I wouldn't be surprised if I got sick of thinking about it in a couple months and deleted this one too, though.

But even though I do feel like I need to talk about it sometimes, and it would be nice to have people who can understand what I'm going through, I'm still hesitant or reluctant to try to make friends with people JUST because they're trans, too. If that's the only thing i've got in common with someone then that's sort of a shitty thing to base a friendship on. If we've got other shared interests and compatible personality? Awesome. But I sort of shoot myself in the foot here because... even though stuff like the trans gaming and FTM gaming subreddits seem like they could be a good place to start, I don't want to do things like join steam groups, for example, because I don't want my steam profile to reveal that I'm trans. Or things like that, that would have it ""attached"" to me - it kind of sounds like I'm ashamed, and I don't know, maybe I am. So maybe I'm doing all of this to myself and making it harder than it needs to be. I don't know. Being trans is not exactly something I *like,* I guess.

There's a few support groups at the clinic where I do my shots that I'd really like to check out sometime, that seems like it'd be a good start to feeling less isolated whether I ended up closer friends with anyone there or not, but I haven't got a car right now, they're pretty late in the evening and it's a long bus ride between the clinic and my place. 

I don't know. I'm just sort of lonely and frustrated and probably doing a lot of this to myself."

I've thought about it since i was young, 13,14 ish. I remember finding what gender are you quizzes on FB and trying to figure that out. Now with each day passing, I try to find a way to quell the thoughts and move on. I have lived at home for the past two years I know my mother and maybe my father are accepting. I just don't want to bring down the truth on them, not while I live at home. My brother no longer lives at home. I have two sisters, one with severe bipolar complicated person to deal with, the other is normal, enjoys ballet in highschool no issues. I just don't want to force more things on them. The older one can be quite obsessive and I think that because she sees me doing it she will try something to get the attention back on her. I cannot force this upon them. Part of me wants to disappear and do this in a covert manner and show up one day as a new person. 

I am looking for advice and any tips in terms of how to proceed.

Been very happy living as a male, though I don't pass at all (I hope to start T in about six months and eventually get top surgery). 

He's supportive, didn't leave me, and is all around a wonderful husband. I'm gay, so I'm pretty happy with staying with him in a relationship.

He is straight. And I realize that his orientation is just as valid as mine, and I'm not trying to ""turn him gay"". He's somewhat asexual, and he has some what people might call ""old fashioned"" views about sex, like, it should never be talked about in front of anyone, and indeed, barely talks about it with me. He didn't grow up in a conservative christian household, not really sure where that came from, nor does he. I think it's just his uncomfortableness with the subject rather than how he was raised. 

I don't mind so much and can deal with being in just a romantic relationship with him. However, he's concerned with how it looks to everyone else. He doesn't want to be called gay, and some of his friends have already made fun of him, asking ""hey, when did you realize you were gay?"" and ""wow, so you're gay now?"". It hurts him, understandably, because that's not his orientation, plus, heterosexual sex is uncomfortable enough to him rather than the thought of gay sex entering the picture he told me.

We are currently going to a therapist, but it's mainly for me for help with my transition. My husband is in the sessions with me because we both felt it would be good to work through issues that way. The therapist is not a sex therapist though, just a gender therapist. 

I would like, I suppose, to have that sexual relationship with my husband, but at the same time, never want to force him into something he's not happy with. 

We don't have sex now barely, and he's stated that after my transition, he's just expecting the sex to completely stop. I would like it to not stop, but again...I don't want to force anything on him.

We both realize in the future we may have to split up, but we both love each other very much and don't want to. To him, sex isn't an important part, to me, it sort of is.

I think what I'm asking is how do I overcome the desire to have sex with my husband or learn how to make it not such a big deal to myself? There are no other issues in the marriage other than this one point, we're very happy, he's just...not attracted to men. 

What does it mean for us? Do we break up over something as stupid as sex or is this something that can be dealt with? Are we just not compatable enough, despite being happy with everything else? 

It's sort of at a situation where I could stop my transition so he could be happy, at the same time he doesn't want me to go back to being the way I was--depressed and unhappy with everything. I feel selfish, I guess, and he does too."

Aoveron,asktransgender,DAE find it an inexplicably difficult to succeed with gender-based style before they transitioned?,"One of the things I struggle to describe to people is what was wrong with masculine style and fashion for me.  I'm trying to better understand this myself, so I'm wondering if this explanation feels familiar to any of you.  If so, can you tell me about it?  It may help me figure out more about how I think about my self-identity and outward expression.

(If you are FTM feel free to swap masculine/feminine here, it should be similar even though stereotypical interest in appearance is different for males and females.)

--

People often tell me that I made a great ""guy"". Handsome, stylish, etc.  They didn't see anything wrong and have no idea why I needed to change.

In my mind I was by far primarily interested in feminine style... bodies, fashion, face, hair, etc.  I'm sure this would be familiar to most of you.

Even still, I would also often see an attractive male style I would think *could* work for me.  Something like: http://i.imgur.com/X9I9xwd.jpg (optimistic I know).

But the problem was it never seemed to work.  Not just like, I'd never have Bradley Cooper's looks, but, no style ever seemed to ""land"" even for me.  Beard, hair, clothes, I couldn't find ANYTHING I was consistently happy with, and so I went through frequent new wardrobes, changed my hair and beard every day in an attempt to find something consistent.

Still every day something would be off and this was a huge factor in my dysphoria and general dissatisfaction with life.

The easiest way I could describe it:  The beard or hair I had *should* have looked good, I could tell, but didn't look right on ME.  I had a great beard... but it felt *way* off on my actual face.

Now I don't have this problem.  Even though I'm not conventional at all for a female, nearly every day I have time to get ready I feel awesome, like it's the right style for me.  My skin looks better without hair, my hair looks better long, face better without a beard, body better with boobs, etc.

No one else seems to understand why, and I'm not sure why either.

I don't know if I'm explaining this right, but is this relatable at all?

I'm also interested if this is a more common experience for MTF than FTM people, because of the way the fashion and style industries and social attitudes are disproportionately geared toward women in general.

Any related experiences at all would be helpful!"
JaclynWolfe,asktransgender,[MTF] Chance of my wife getting pregnant?,"So my wife and I are poly and she recently started a relationship with another transwoman.  Her girlfriend has been on HRT for 9 years, but still has ejaculate.  I'm curious to know the ""actual"" chance of my wife getting protected from unprotected sex with her girlfriend.

I know everyone says that there is always a chance, but realistically what is the likelihood?  More specifically can anyone provide a single incidence of this occurring after years on HRT?  I've looked and I can't find a single recorded incidence of this happening in any forums or anything.  I'm really looking to see if anyone knows of this ever occurring.

Also, I know people may mention things about birth control, but that isn't an option for my wife due to a variety of health issues and allergies.

Oh, and just to clarify I'm MTF too.  My wife and I have had regular, unprotected sex for 3 years now without any issue, but my orgasms are dry.

**Update:** Thank you everyone for sharing! You've convinced me that we should be using protection from now on.  Sorry for being so resistant to it, my wife can't take birth control, use UIDs, and condoms cause her pain, so it's hard to give up penetrative sex.  We'll work through it though, thank you again!"

Space49,asktransgender,"I don't feel trans, but people like labeling. Any thoughts?","Basically, I don't feel anything in regards to my internal sense of gender. I don't feel like a man; I don't feel like a woman; I don't feel like anything else. 

I'm okay with being genetically male, but I feel somewhat feminine and not really masculine in any way. I should be fine then, and be able to give anyone the two fingered salute if they question me. However, this isn't the case, hence why I'm posting. My internal debate at the present is whether I should continue living as male, but express myself how I please, or identify as the other gender and continue living practically in the same way. 

When it comes to school, and university and jobs in the future I need to know whether I should present myself as the opposite gender in order to go to the toilets that I would feel less judged by going to (as opposed to appearing as a female going to the male toilets) and have a roommate who'd I feel more comfortable with. At the end of the day, I don't care what gender I am, it's just that I don't like the associations with being male and the pronouns that come along with it, otherwise I'd probably be fine with it.

I'm okay with answering questions if you're as confused as I am right now.

I'm sort of between being open about being trans and not, but that's on my own will. I was a bit more stealth for a couple of years, but it started to feel lonely. At this point, I tell my closer friends, but no one can guess that I'm trans. You could say I pass, but I hate that word.

It was bumpy at first, but my family totally supports me.

I’ve been in a relationship with a guy for years now. His family knows me quite well me, but they don’t know I’m trans. His family really likes me, and I feel like I’m a part of his family at this point.

dawn5792,asktransgender,"paranoid about dvt - smoking about 2 cigs a day, can't stop","Hey all,

A little background - I'm 31, almost 32, started HRT 2 months ago today with 2mg Estradiol Cyprionate(sp?) injections and 100 mg spiro.  Smoked pack a day for 12 years.  in a couple of those years it was purely vaping.  Generally good health, though slightly overweight(165 at 5'7, and falling).  Don't drink too much, generally a couple drinks a week.  I generally bike for exercise ~ 40-60 miles a week.  Outside of exercise my work is sedentary(attorney) though I try to be standing as often as possible.

When I first started HRT I quit cold turkey, that lasted about a week.  After that I fell off the wagon and began smoking again, though significantly reduced - I made myself promise I could only have one cig for every pack I bought - and can usually limit myself to 2, maybe three a day.

I know it's not good for me.  I know it's bad for feminization.  I don't need to be told to quit, I'm just having a HELL of a hard time actually doing it.  I really want to and am gonna try chantix soon if I can't in the coming weeks.

That said, I am paranoid as HELL about developing a blood clot for obvious reasons.  every tiny little thing my calf and thigh muscles do makes me really paranoid, and I've been getting little muscle spasms in my calves and thighs.  No actual symptoms of DVT - no pain, swelling, or tenderness or warmth.  I hate feeling terrified like this so much.

My question: What is my actual risk?  I don't want to tell my doctor because I don't want them to force me to quit HRT, it's working wonders for me.  I'm terrified that I'm asymptomatic and wondering if I should at least get the docs to do an ultrasound just to be sure.

Thoughts?  Again - you don't need to tell me to stop smoking.  I know that.  My question is how much fire am I really playing with here?"
legolikesubstance,asktransgender,"Not how, but when is it appropriate to ask about preferred gender pronouns?","I have a question that I haven't been able to find an answer to that I'd love to have answered by individuals more familiar with the trans community and/or I guess manners in general. Please excuse (and correct!) me if I make certain assumptions, I'm still in the process of learning. 

From what I've learned by reading various articles and watching videos, a generally accepted way to ask about gender pronouns is pretty straightforward and basically involves introducing yourself, stating your preferred pronouns, then asking the other person their name and preferred pronouns. 

Assuming this is in fact an appropriate way, when should it be used? If I suspect someone may be trans (based on what others have said, comments made by the individual, appearance, or any other of millions of possibilities) and I don't want to offend them by using an inappropriate pronoun, is there a polite way to ask? I feel like asking only people I suspect to be trans is a slippery slope and almost pointing out that they aren't passing and it seems like it could be a somewhat offensive question. 

Right now my default isn't to ask everyone their PGPs, but should it be? The more I think about it, the more I realize the tremendous number of assumptions based on ""norms"" that I've been taught about what's male or female and thus assigned he or she pronouns in my mind automatically. 

In general I'd probably wait until someone's friends referred to them by specific pronouns and then use those but what about in situations where I'm meeting someone one-on-one or where nobody in a group of people really knows each other?

People come in all shapes and sizes so I know it's nearly impossible to know whether or not someone is trans (or just about anything else) just by looking at them and that I definitely won't know their PGPs. I would just like to know when it's appropriate to ask about PGPs and whether people tend to prefer being referred to with the correct pronouns more often than people find being asked offensive.

ThrowAwayMyLife,asktransgender,Is my sexuality really changing or do I just like the idea of being with a guy?,"So I'm MTF and been on hormones for six months, and just when I start to think things are getting less confusing.. lol nope.

I'm dealing with the possible sexuality shift that some other trans people talk about, but I'm having a hard time deciding if it's legitimate and dealing with the implications of that. Before transition, I had a very strong attraction to women and a very week attraction to men (I've never been particularly turned off by the sight of a penis, it's just that I didn't like what most were connected to. This being the case I only found myself attracted to very, very few men, in particular very effeminate ones). I'm finding however that there seems to be occurring a shift away from women and towards men, so I guess I'm becoming bi, possibly? I don't feel quite as intensely attracted to women like i once did, which isn't to say I don't feel attracted to them at all, but it's like my attraction for women has calmed down and an attraction for men is very subtly ramping up.

And I have my theories for this. One is that I've always been bi but didn't feel comfortable dating or being with men sexually as a guy. The other, which I fear may be true, is I'm not actually becoming attracted to men but i like the idea of being with one. For one, I never find myself checking men out the way I traditionally have with women. I still very rarely notice men out and about, with rare exceptions I guess. But there have been instances where i begin talking to one and then I begin to feel slightly attracted, like maybe I'm pan but only with guys and not girls and, that doesn't make sense.. does it? Idk

So.. on that note, I've actually been talking to a guy and we have plans to meet, and he knows I'm trans and even knows I've only ever been with women and that I don't know how to feel about any of this yet. And we've just been kind of talking and flirting and other things and it just feels so.. good. And I can't explain it, it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. But I can't tell if I'm actually, physically attracted to him or if I just like the idea of being with a guy. I do think he's cute (and I've been having confusing thoughts about a lot of guys that way recently and i find myself liking traits I never liked before, namely facial hair). And I guess I can't really know until we meet in person, and I'm just so afraid I'm going to find out that, no, I'm not attracted and this whole thing will just be one embarrassing mistake. 

And then.. I know I have some internalized homophobia because this feels a lot like ""choosing to be gay"" (yes technically bi in this case but still) and that in doing so I'm just proving all those conservatives and others who believe it's a choice correct. I remember before I started HRT, I would say things like ""I hope I don't start liking guys"" and, I think a couple months in I realized how problematic that is and stopped feeling that way, thinking that if that happens, it happens. And I think that's telling of my attitude toward this whole thing maye. It also didn't help that my then extremely insecure girlfriend would say things like ""I don't want you to start liking boys and then leave me for one"" (which is sprinkled with a very particular kind of irony considering that she -basically- left me for another guy, but I digress...).

Yeah I'm just having a hard time working through this and looking for similar experiences. Any trans women or men have similar feelings? How did you react to it? What did you figure out?

Thanks"

PavementBlues,asktransgender,Have any other trans women dealt with stubborn testosterone levels?,"When I started transition, my testosterone levels were through the roof. At 1,035 ng/dL, they were barely within normal male ranges. This came as a bit of a shock, since I don't have masculine features or much body hair, but I guess the body is a complicated machine.

My T responded well to 100mg a day of spiro, but after a month was still in the lower end of male ranges at 350 ng/dL. We bumped the spiro to 200mg a day, and my T went down a bit more to 255 ng/dL, but it's still not even close to our target of less than 100 ng/dL.

My doctor and I have added 5mg a day of finasteride to the mix, and are going to step the spiro up to 300mg per day next since my liver and kidneys are responding well, but it's definitely discouraging.

I still wear makeup/dress in feminine brands though normally it's just a t shirt and jeans or tracksuit bottoms.

The reason I have been thinking about this is that one of the children in conversation said that they thought I was a girl which sparked a co worker to ask again what she said. This put me in a very awkward situation as the co worker doesn't know and as I am presented as a male at work I feel that it may confuse both staff and the people I work with.

zauraz,asktransgender,I don't seem to care anymore. Is this the right way?,"Beginning of this year the idea that I might be trans struck me. Something I got all enthusiastic about and found that might be a solution to why I felt wrong a lot of the time. I had wanted to be a girl since 11/12th grade and secretly wished for it in a long time. Even bringing up hypothetical scenarios to friends what they would do if they ever had to live as a girl for some time.

I started going to therapy, eventually making me begin the process of getting a referral to gender therapy in my country. I came out to my bestfriends and mother as 'questioning my gender' and started researching transition etc. Experimentation also followed. 'Crossdressing' was something I had been doing since I started to wish I was a girl and that always felt amazing. I started shaving my legs, painting nails at times and generally letting my hair grow out during this time. 

About 1 - 2 months of constantly questioning made me in the end lose the 'wish' I had. Instead my mind was basically a grey cloud of things floating around. I could not with certainty say what I wanted or anything really. Due to therapy I managed to supress it for a month, not stop thinking about it, but atleast putting it away. Which ended with extreme doubt and it came back with 'wait what if I am not trans?'. Since then I have been in a deadlock where I can't accept either. Maybe I am not trans? Maybe I am?. It has become an unhealthy spiral that I can't get out of. I am forcing myself to stay in the deadlock aswell.

Recently I have started to find a new 'acceptance' of some of my masculine traits and generally it feels like I sometimes think I can actually see myself as handsome, ok looking and I even inadvertently acted more masculine. Something which made me doubt extremly... Why am I forcing myself to do this? Countered by the question Why am I forcing myself to be trans?

Gender referral is still ages away and my first meeting with a psychologist made them consider that I needed a second meeting and there will be even more months until I get my referral and I will probably have graduated by then. My life will have to go on after school but my plans are sorta messed up due to my gender therapy and it makes me feel hugely uncertain about everything that will come. Right now I am so fucking tired of it all. Its sorta too late to transition in my eyes as I will never experience teen years as a girl and adult life will be work and probably make my life more 'difficult'. Some of this is probably decision.

Lately I don't want this anymore at all. I wish I could just stop thinking about this shit and just 'live a normal' life and be 'equal' once more to the people around me. 11 Months without any fucking progress is slowly killing me and I could care less about transitioning or anything at the moment. Never was excited about the process either, maybe the end results...

NaidaEvee,asktransgender,What is Transtrender?,"I have begun to see it more and more, at first I thought it was a misnomer or someone misspelling transgender. It seems to be some kind of anti-transgender term and used with vitriol normally.

I feel like it implies that someone is transgender because they think its cool or hip, but that seems laughable. That's like wanting to be a leper, someone who is more often than not disowned immediately, fired, or treated like human garbage.

bourbontoothpaste,asktransgender,Think I upset my friend? (long + mini rant),"Okay I defs upset her. She's MtF transgender and has been on HRT for like. A year. And she's generally very down and doesn't think she passes. She hates being trans and she thinks her wife is still with her because she feels obligated and. Idk. And this upset me because I don't see the need to be down about everything? Like, her wife isn't just with her for that, they have a kid and love each other. And she's only been on HRT for a year, which is like, no time at all. She hasn't had any surgery or anything, so really, the only place to go is up.

Maybe because I'm afab trans or non-genital dysphoric or something but I find it really hard to empathise with people who are so down about their transition. Like, you're *doing it*. You're transitioning! You're turning your outside into a reflection of your inside, and those sort of changes take time!

I'm probably not being sympathetic and like, if you need to lecture me, feel free (just don't talk down to me, please. we're all adults here). I do understand that it's hard. I was misgendered tonight in the *dark*, when I hadn't said a word and was in boymode. I'm not on HRT. My journey is just beginning.

And that's what it is, a journey. I don't understand why some people (not my friend, necessarily, but just, some people) are so negative the whole way through. And this is gonna sound mean but how am I supposed to take my journey, and be happy about it, when now all it feels like is I'm rubbing it in her face. ""ha ha i don't care as much as you do. ha ha im happier with myself *and* it's been less painful for me. ha ha my family accepts me"". Ofc that's not what I say, but I feel like that's how she takes it.

She was messaging me every day in the beginning bc she was waiting for an apparently common moment where, when the full reality of being transgender hits some people, they break down. She wanted to be there for me (which was nice of her). But it didn't happen to me. With my transition has come a peace that I've never known. I finally don't care what people think of me. And that's all she seems to care about now.

So idk what to do. I'm not on hormones, but I might go on them in the future. What am I gonna do if I start passing before she did (timeline wise, and entirely hypothetical, but still). She actually asked me, when I told her, ""what happened to not wanting to transition"". And I don't remember ever saying that. Perhaps not medically transition (though I *definitely* want top surgery at some point, I think). But from the moment I realised, I've been transitioning. My friend calls me 'dude' 10x more often than he used to. My sister has been wonderful. 

Ugh. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Maybe... has anyone else had this happen to them? Maybe...maybe I think she's being a little ungrateful, too. There are so many trans people who can't medically transition. They're never going to 'pass'. I have another friend who is brilliant, and she can't transition at all (bc location + money + personal reasons). I'm part of my uni's queer society and there are three trans people on the committee (including me) and absolutely none of us pass for cis. That doesn't stop them from being absolutely wonderful people who are fun and friendly and... positive. 

Idk. For me, you could pass, but if you're always down on yourself about it, then what was the point? But if you don't pass and aren't negative (one girl was talking about shaving her face bc she had to. she wasn't whinging or whining. it made it an easy conversation that wasn't awkward). i mean, it does depend on the person, i guess. i'm lucky. i don't really have genital dysphoria, so like, when im on my period, it's no more a hassle than it would be for a cis girl (potentially less-so bc mine are pretty chill cycles). but there's defs a difference between dysphoria and just being negative.

i'll probably get hate for this but idk. i needed to get it off my chest. if i've said anything problematic, let me know (like an adult please :D ). if anyone has any suggestions, also let me know lol this didn't really go in the direction i wanted it to but it's late and im tired and im gonna go to bed"
pretzelbagel,asktransgender,Where to even start?,"Little background on myself. I grew up in a pretty hardcore Christian household. Gender roles were not questioned and sexuality was some secret shame that needed to be repressed and hidden away. Looking back this did a lot of damage to me as I grew up. Being a boy I was expected to do boy things. Hunting, sports, date girls, be into cars, etc. I had interest in none of this and was told quite often how much of a disappointment I was. 

In my early teen years I developed an attraction to other boys. When my parents found out it was pretty much the end of everything. ""Disappointment"" was replaced with things like ""abomination"", ""faggot"", ""unclean"", etc. The day I turned 18 I was kicked out of the house and I've been on my own since then.

I'm now 20 and very recently I've been doing a lot of soul searching. Between my boyfriend and very supportive group of close friends I've slowly but gradually come to the conclusion that I'm most likely gender dysphoric. I've always hated how masculine and hairy my body is and I've done my best to come across as cute. My voice is pretty deep though, so that gives me away. I honestly hate being called ""sir"", ""young man"", ""this gentleman"", and pretty much any other masculine pronoun you can think of. My friends that know I'm struggling with this refer to me as ""she"" and ""her"". Every time I hear those it just makes me so happy. 

I've started to take small steps towards looking more girly. Growing my hair out, getting into a better shape, shave everything, etc. That only takes me so far though. I think I'd like to transition but have no idea how to go about it. Hell, I'm not even ""officially"" diagnosed with dysphoria yet. The only problem is that I have no idea how to go about it. I live in a small town of about 20,000 in Minnesota, so options are a little limited. Do I just go to my Doctor and tell her what's going on? Can she refer me to someone else? Do I have to have meetings with a shrink? I'm so lost and any help anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated."
Pandora-Panda,asktransgender,What am I?,"Hello, first time poster here, sorry for the length. I need advice/support/information in the worst way.

I’ve had this feeling for a while that I’m not exactly ‘normal’ as far as my sexuality goes. So far it has been very hard to deal with because I’m just really not sure what to do with it. I feel like something is missing, like my life is slowly being sucked away because there’s some kind of hole in my mind where something should be.

I constantly find myself holding back thoughts like “Wow that’s cute”, or “I wonder if I would look good in/with that”, other very ‘unmanly’ things like that. It has gotten to the point where I can’t even say the word “cute” seriously without feeling awkward. I usually just replace it with “cool” or “awesome”.

Sometimes I get these thoughts in my head that other men are attractive, sometimes even my friends. Luckily I’ve learned to bite my tongue well. I am still attracted to women, but… I don’t know how to explain it. It is a weird kind of attraction, like a fascination or envy. I constantly think about turning into a woman and I can’t get it out of my head. Am I just a pervert?

I think I might be transsexual (is it still called that before operations?), but I am not certain. I come from a very religious Mormon family and a very religious community where stuff like this is shunned and taboo (smallish town). I’ve had 0 experience with transsexuals, or even gay or bi people (sorry if those terms aren’t PC, not offense intended).

I think it is also worth mentioning a few things about my current state of mind, just in case I am feeling something else. I suffer from major depressive disorder, and have for a while, though this is the highest point I’ve been at in nearly 3 years. I was abducted and sexually abused when I was young, along with having a very abusive father (both physically and emotionally), though my father hasn’t been a part of my life since I was about 14 (I am now 19)

I would like to request your description of the feeling you felt or the thoughts you had before you finally identified what you had to do. Also, I would like to know if anyone else has come from a very religious background and how things worked out in the end. I don’t want to lose my family, but I don’t want to be untrue to myself either.

**tl;dr** bad childhood, weird emotions and thoughts, no experience with this stuff, please share thoughts you had before accepting yourself, or any thoughts you have on my situation.

PS: sorry again for the length and anything that may be offensive, it is not my intention to offend, and thank you to anyone and everyone who replies.

WhycantibeMaggie,asktransgender,Why can't I just be Maggie,"Hello. So I just turned 18 a few weeks ago. I was born a male and still live as a male. However I want to be a female. Everything I do connects more to the female aspect, and I just feel and believe I am a women, not a male. I am sexual attracted to females and that will never change. I still live with my parents, who have no clue about this, same with my siblings. I kinda crossdress when nobodies home using my sister/mom's clothing. Nobody know that I feel this way and I feel like with the way the USA is changing I will never be accepted. However i just cant live with the fact im stuck as a male any longer. Im a outsider. I have no friends, I have had 0 sexual contact with anybody. I also hate my male parts as I wish I had female parts. Pm me If you can help me  in anyway.

-Anal_Lint-,asktransgender,I've been scared to ask this for a very long time...,"So I'm just going to come right out and ask it: is it possible that my porn use has created some sort of artificial transness in me?

I know these kinds of questions often get shot down pretty quickly, but it would really mean a lot of you guys hear me out and help me.

Like the question suggests, I am worried that the trans feelings I have may be caused by watching trans porn and other related materials. For some background, when I started watching porn, it was exclusively lesbian (it never felt right to see a man in that situation, not because I thought it was gay, I just thought the male body and face was unattractive), from there it went to trans porn, (still no guys), then trans porn with guys, then some sissy, trap, bi, and gay videos. Somewhere along the line I crossdressed while watching these videos (I've since stopped) and while I do kind of miss it, I felt I wasn't pretty enough to wear dresses and stockings and the likes. Around the same time I started questioning my gender and sexual identity.

In my search for the answers behind my questioning I've stopped masturbating for a couple weeks and haven't really been viewing any porn. 

I would love to answer any questions you feel might help me find the answer to this problem. Thank you all so much!!"
throwaway777222999,asktransgender,Just another of the same type of question...,"Hi, 

I am 22 years old. The earliest time I can remember knowing I wasn't like everyone else was when I was six. I had a dream where I was in a dress with some of the girls from my class. 

I'm in the closet to my family and the majority of my friends. I've been to therapy to talk about it. I just don't know what to do. Some of my family would be totally, completely in shock and awe if I ever was to do something about it.

And when it comes to doing something about it, I'm so self conscious, I don't think I could leave the house until I was passable. Am I supposed to put my life on hold for two years? 

But the more important thing is that I'm confused and scared and I don't know if I should act on it. 

I feel as if every day I become more masculine, less feminine, less chance of being 'her', the person I picture myself as.

Has anyone been in a similar position? Does anyone have any real advice? Should I see a new therapist? A specialist?

Tl;Dr: Have known I want to be a girl for the majority of my life, been in closet forever, sad and feeling as if time to act and enjoy life is running out."

mtc6,asktransgender,Stopping being stealth?,"I went stealth when I went to uni. Throughout the past few years of my life, I thought that was what I wanted. This stems from the hatred of myself for being trans and my immense fear of rejection.

I still wasn't able to be just me: I had to keep up a facade again...I no longer felt I was just being myself. Now, I am working on coming out (again). It is just odd as I put so much effort into going stealth, only to find out that it causes me so much pain.

But the appointments that were made for my kidney/urine tests were canceled because the hospital that they were scheduled at doesn't ""participate"" in the marketplace insurance plans (obamacare.)

I'm really tempted just to take them anyway. I feel my mental sanity slowly slipping away from me. It'd be so easy just to reach into my purse and just take them...

My current therapist (who I haven't been happy with anyway) doesn't want to see me for another 2 months. And she thinks that I've been on HRT for like a month now.

First - As I mentioned in an earlier post I had my endo appointment after a year of DIY - he said I'd done a good job and continued everything I was on (E, Spiro, and Progesterone) .... 

Second - although I doubt my ability to pass (and always have and decided I would never be able to) I keep getting ""mam'd"" everywhere! I joined a health club and told them I was transgender so as to use the locked locker room/bathroom - my trainer, a great lady, asked me a lot of questions (actually too many like have you had surgery yet and when do you think you will - I'm not) - I said in a sort of self-deprecating way that ""I'd make a very ugly woman"" to which she said ""Wrong - you're a beautiful woman now!"" and to top that off I got hit on by an old guy the other morning ....

Third - and this was the **MOST** unexpected - my primary care doctor at my visit earlier this week said she'd like to change the gender marker on all my medical and hospital records from **M to F** ..... WHAT??????????? I've never even thought that, for me, this would be an option! 

Last - good diet and exercise pays off - I'm motivated and over the last 18 months have lost 68 pounds and 10 inches off my waist :)

SomeScatteredThought,asktransgender,Is this what dysphoria feels like?,"So small story time with a question. Since coming to terms with being trans and gradually settling into that realization, I've found myself wondering what exactly dysphoria feels like. I've never had very strong feelings of distaste for my body. Sure, I hate my facial and body hair, or look at certain aspects and just think, ick that could look so much nicer, and that sort of thing. Even if those thoughts can be frequent, its not really caused me much turmoil, so I've felt like I don't understand what its like to feel dysphoria, like a lot of other people seem to feel.

But, today I've neglected shaving my face, so it can grow out a little and I can try waxing it off. I haven't missed a day shaving in years. Even before the realization of being trans I always hated having facial hair. It just feels like theres this layer of grunge and grime over my face, I hate touching my face and feeling that prickle. I hate seeing it in the mirror. Thats always just been a sort of nagging annoyance. But today, having let it grown for less than a day, I've found myself feeling bouts of unease and discomfort. I want it gone and its making me anxious. I've been wanting to just shave it off again and be done with it. But then I'll just repeat this in another day. I'm constantly aware of that feeling and its driving me batty. 

So, then the question, is this what dysphoria feels like? I apologize if this sounds stupid or insensitive or anything bad in any way, I'm not sure if I'm really articulating my feelings very well. I just know I've been feeling uncharacteristically anxious for a day where I haven't even left the house, with nothing different, other than letting the hair grow out. Even now I just want to grab the razor and slice it all off, and I keep wandering to the bathroom to wash my face in hopes it wont feel so foul. "

Xindie7,asktransgender,How do you all deal with the surgery wait list blues?,"Hi All,

So, I intellectually know I've been super lucky in my transition. Coming out at work and home went super smoothly, got access to hormones in a not unreasonable amount of time, wonderful partner, started passing fairly well and so on. Each step seemed to be definitive progress, movement forward, which for a type A and obsessive high energy girl was great. 

Theeeeeen I got eligible for surgery in my country early this summer. I know I got super lucky and I got all my letters and approval stuff done within a month or two of eligibility. Letters forwarded to montreal, wewt! I'm also super lucky to have the awesome funding and support to actually go through with this thing that I know so many girls are trapped out of.

Thing is, I've (desperately) wanted this basically my whole damn life. I can remember desperately wanting to have the proper genitals even when I was 10 or 11 and just barely hearing about it in some of the mid 90's trans documentaries. My genital dysphoria is....managable. Sex..... works..... but is a lot of effort and visualizing/fantasy and stressful. Other functions are more or less utilitarian and I can power through them

but I just want to get this goddamn done at this point.

Cut to about a month ago with absolute radio silence from the clinic. Apparently they were on summer holiday, so I waited until after to get in contact with them and make sure everything arrived. After another flurry of back and forth emails I'm starting to think ""OH MY GOD ITS HERE, IT'S FINALLY FUCKING HERE, IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN!!!!!"".  

""okay, your application seems correct and finished, we'll let you know when were ready to book a date, which should be about 6 months before we are ready to"".
  
Crash bang, smack into the brick wall of bureaucracy. Yeah, I was jumping the gun a bit. Assuming the ""book a date"" is a few months before actually having the surgery I'm probably looking at next summer before it ACTUALLY happens. And in the meantime I'm left in the lurch with nothing more to do, nothing more to push forward on and keep in contact.....and feeling.....helpless. It's this lack of control that really hurts for a type A person like me (I'm a very high energy, ""lets get it done, progress progress progress"" type person)

Now, it's not the end of the world. I've always been a high functioning depressive, able to look people in the eyes and lie that I'm doing totally fine, everything is wonderful, regardless of how I'm feeling. Still though, the last month or so has been....a little hard. It seems like for a day or two every week, week and a half or so I just have this huge low energy funk. I get home from work and basically just curl up in bed and stare at nothing or reddit or maaaaybe youtube and just mope and worry and wonder when. I can't even bring myself to sit up in a chair and play video games or read.  I get out and hang out with friends on the weekends, I spend time with my  partner, I get out to work and get a reasonable amount of socialization and exercise. So it feels like I'm doing a lot of the standard ""dealing with depression"" type advice things, but it still keeps happening like clockwork. 

I'm curious, though, of people that have gone through similar things before, how did you all cope with the brick wall of ""hurry up and wait""? Maybe I can steal a strategy of two that will help me push through the days a bit easier.  "

Now that there's a vague timeline of it actually happening(as in 'this could actually happen in say x years') it's kinda freaking me out. The idea of my balls being cut off is freaking me out a bit. But like I want the end result of having a vagina. The logistics are scary but I desperately want the end result and I'm so confused
mtf001,asktransgender,Want breasts but do not necessarily want to transition.,"Since I started puberty I have thought of what it would be like to have breasts. I have read transgender fiction for years and have been excited by the idea of growing breasts. I have taken estrogen on and off for years. I would start and then sometime in the matter of a couple weeks I would get scared of fully transitioning and losing my male sexual performance and go off of them. I am wondering what should I do/who am I?

 I am currently taking estrogen and loving what it is doing to my nipples and breasts as they are getting puffier. Any help is appreciated as I am really lost! Thanks! "
Vomit34,asktransgender,Envy,"Recently my friend came out as transgender. I was happy for her, because i'd known she'd been struggling with these things for years. She started HRT, and in a month, she passed and everyone gendered her correctly, and it's made me feel so...angry. She's young (16), and the fact she was able to come out so early and pass so quickly makes me so incredibly jealous. I'm 19m, and no one knows i'm trans, and the fact that her parents were so accepting and helpful makes me so damn jealous. She gets to come out and live her life authentically, but i'll likely never get to come out, and'll probably end up wasting myself by the time im 30. Life is just one hell of a ride ain't it "
1terraforming,asktransgender,"Question: Can ""male"" and ""female"" be legitimate gender identities?","Excluding the fact that sometimes cisgender people often use gender to distinguish between male and female (ex: checking the box for male in the gender section of medical records), are there any instances where one can say their gender *and* sex are both male? Personally, I am not completely on board with someone's gender being ""male/female/intersex"" because the construct of biological sex is skewed enough. Any feedback is appreciated.

FWIW, I am a transwoman pushing for LGBTQ+ rights/equity in Public Health and Policy.

hmmmthisisntgood,asktransgender,Weight.....what the hell should I be doing? Losing? Gaining? Completely lost and would love your collective advice!,"Here's my goal - to look feminine.  Primarily in the face (because the body can be fudged with clothing), but I'd like some boobs and an ass too.

Here's my problem - gaining weight makes my face rounder and softer (yay!), but gives me a shameful muffin top and a beer belly (nay!).  But losing weight makes my face bony and manly (nay!), but gives me a figure that doesn't look like a middle-aged football fan with a hotdog and Bud addiction (yay!).

I never lost much weight before starting HRT.  Began at 160lbs, 5'10"", a few years ago, so not too bad.  I'm now 170lbs.

Should I start again from scratch?  Shed down to about 140lbs to strip as much off as possible (something I never did), then slowly rebuild (and hopefully put the fat in the right places)?  Or is it just a case of waiting...and waiting...and waiting for nature to take its course?

My levels are reasonable.  Post-SRS, so testosterone is pretty much zero, and only taking estradiol at the moment.

I think I look best at about 180lbs, which is very chubby compared to many transgirls who look fantastic at waif-like weights in the 120s-140s.  But I'm also wondering if I get below that awkward ""might be a girl, might be a guy"" middleground in weight and reach the lower end of the spectrum, would I have an overall more feminine appearance?

Literally totally lost as to what strategy I should take, and what weight I should end up as.

Oh, by the way, dieting sucks.  Life is far too short to deny myself the pleasures of eating sensibly with the occasional piece of chocolate, slice of pizza, or glass (bottle?) of wine.  I'd ideally like to take a path that is very much in the middle if possible; reaching my later years having nibbled on nothing but salads for twenty years is something I'd definitely regret.

negrosan,asktransgender,Being transgender and masturbation,"So I discovered in transgender. And now u

My doctor prescribed 100mg of spiro and the 0.1mg estradiol patch. 

Thanks to my insurance making a fuss, I was on just the spiro for the last two weeks and I was starting to get annoyed that I hadn't noticed anything different, but I figured I was just being impatient. But now I've had the patch on for about six hours and there's... something. Maybe. I feel kind of energized? Everything's just kind of... more. Am I imagining it? Is it a coincidence?

A trans woman named Jennifer was buried by her family under her deadname Geoffrey.  It was an open-casket funeral, and her corpse was modified, hair cut, and dressed up in a male presentation.  Jennifer's transition was also omitted from the obituary.  

Her friends (understandably) disagreed with the treatment of Jennifer's funeral, and there is plenty of support on Facebook.  

However, Yahoo commenters disgustingly AGREED with the family.  They all talked about how ""Poetic"" the whole thing was.  *""You come into this world as a male, and you leave as a male.""*

How often does this happen, and how can it be prevented?  

Can I include gender presentation in my will?  "

QuestioningMtF1,asktransgender,Am I trans? Need Help!,"(20yo AMAB)

I understand that I cant get a diagnoses of what I am on here, so Ill take all responses w/ a grain of salt. However, being this case, please put on your ""gender therapist hats"" for the time being and let me know, in complete honesty, what you think I am. Ill list reasons I think I'm trans and why I might not be and ill try to keep it as short as possible.

For Trans:

- Feel like I have a ""female sexuality"", since puberty I've only been able to sexually fantasize as female, since I cant get turned on otherwise and it feels wrong. These include everything from TG captions to vanilla porn

- At age 10-12 I was fascinated by gender bending (MtF) cartoons and movies

- At age 14-15 I prayed almost every night to wake up a girl w/breasts and whatnot and when I didn't felt disappointed 

- Saw the youtube video, ""Am I transgender"", and identified with about 4 out of 7 of the ""signs""

- In junior high, when I saw girls wearing Uggs I often got jealous

- used female avatars in many games, although often for sexual reasons
 
- When I see an attractive girl I often imagine being w/ her and being her/ body, clothes and all 

- 80% or more of my dreams in the last few years have been me either as a female or transforming into one. I love those dreams, hate to wake up from them, and have tried lucid dreaming to get them

- I have felt jealousy of lesbian relationships, sometimes (maybe)? women in general

- At age 14 I felt the term ""male lesbian"" best described me as someone who felt I was a lesbian trapped in a male body

- Bad social anxiety throughout adolescence

- Often uncomfortable/out of place in all male groups like sports, locker rooms, and bus rides to games

- Don't seem to have that ""sexual chase"" instinct most straight guys have. Also feel alienated by most straight guy talk about girls

- Have possible ""chest dysphoria"". Often conscious of lack of breasts, and feel something is missing. Including waking up and instantly noticing my flat chest

- Some possible feminine mannerisms, like playing w/ hair, holding hands on hips, etc

- Ive been told by friends they would ""like me more as a girl"". My dad has half jokingly said when I get a girlfriend ill be ""just like her"". 

- Often dislike the way I'm treated, which includes being seen as intimidating and unapproachable 

- Pretty sensitive and emotional at times 

Against being trans:

- I don't seem to have body dysphoria ie. hating my body features. In fact often times enjoy my body/ trying to look good

- I have mostly typical ""masculine"" interests

- Pretty masculine looking/acting

- NOT depressed, in fact relatively happy

- enjoy a number of things about being a guy

- Pretty much forgot about the desire to be a girl since I prayed back when I was 15

- Didn't show childhood ""signs"", except for the fascination of gender bending cartoons/movies pre puberty

Jeddaven,asktransgender,Scared and Confused,"For a number of years now (since I was about 8 years old, as far as I can remember), I have been having feelings of being out of place in my body. These feelings tend to persist for months at a time, sometimes more -- but they have not been continuous. I know that they're unusual, but, the problem is, I have never heard of somebody feeling like I have before. I was born male, but, in essence, I feel like part of my body is wrong or out of place. It's not that I feel like a woman, but moreso that I feel both male and female... Intersex, I think. For a long time now, I've felt this way... But my problem, as you can imagine, is that I'm pretty sure that such a transition would be physically impossible to achieve. Of course, I plan on discussing these feelings with my psychologist before I make any major decisions, but I wanted to ask around for advice from people who have had similar experiences."

JennyLadyBug,asktransgender,Came out to my parents,"So just an update, since I posted a couple times that I was planning to come out today. Going in, I thought my dad would be upset and my mom would welcome me with open arms. It actually turned out to be the opposite. My mom started crying and saying she'd ""lost a son"" and started blaming it on letting me watch Oprah when I was little and not forcing me to pee standing up when I said I didn't want to. She was also upset that I'm changing names because my (decidedly masculine) deadname was after her late father. But at the end she apologized and said she just needed time, which I guess I'm inclined to believe for now? But she's looked at me a couple times and I can see the heartache in her eyes. I haven't really said much to her since.

On the other side of the coin, my dad has already referred to me as ""her"" which was quite a rush. He went back to ""him"" after he saw how my mom was taking it, but I still really appreciated it. Hopefully he'll help her through this.

So I guess the moral of the story is that no matter how well you know the person you're coming out to, it doesn't always turn out like you expect, whether it's for the better, or worse."
SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Dosage being increased?,"Howdy all! So I just got back from my blood tests, and there's good news.

The problem is that, as it would happen, my dosage for the past 6 months has been low. I've been taking two 1mg E pills per day, with two 100mg Spiro. I thought this was the normal amount, but I wasn't developing as quickly as is normal for most of the girls online, and on this site, so that does hurt a little, and I do feel a little held back, but in the long-run it'll be the same, so I'm not too bitter.

I was just wondering how I should factor in my transition. Do I have a lot more developing? Will my development likely start being faster? Any affects I should be aware of in general?

If I don't think about my gender identity, I'm generally ok. I met my boyfriend 3 years ago and the month before I was becoming more and more comfortable with myself being ftm and I was actually mentally preparing myself for coming out. Then I met my boyfriend and all of those feelings got shoved so far into the closet they're currently in narnia. I'm completely smitten with him, I've never really been in a relationship before so it's not something I want to lose... But he's generally pretty homo/transphobic. He's gotten better (my brother is gay and he's ok with that) but I know the moment I even suggest to him I'm anything other than female he'll just go and I don't know if I can mentally handle that (not to mention I owe him and his family a considerable amount of money so if we broke up I would have to move an hour back home and lose my job etc). Generally I'm okay but I've been thinking about my gender more and more lately and it's getting so difficult to just go along as female. He's even made comments like I'm not 'wifely' or very girly which I never really have been and it makes me feel like crap. I want to be what he wants but the way it makes me feel is horrible. Not to mention I see so many things online about being trans and how it's ok to tell people etc and it really makes me panic.

if we watch a show with gay men in it she then worries that im gay. im not. i am atracted to women. so yes im gay in the sense that as a mtf granssexual i want to to be with women.

GorGirl,asktransgender,"How do you manage your hair, in stealth mode, as it gets longer?","A little long winded but I wanted to give context for my question.  :)

So, I'm a 40+ MTF and still not really out to anybody - although it's getting harder all the time as my is hair getting close to shoulder length (I'm planning a coming out for next year).

As my hair grows, I'm styling it in a feminine way; it's simply parted over one eye and swept to the sides - not very original but it actually doesn't look bad if I use a little hair product and tease it a little.  :)

The flip side is I can't count the comments from family about how it's so unbecoming and makes me ""look like a girl""  *sigh*. Of course, it thrills me to hear those comments but they're stated in a somewhat derogatory way. 

I'm sorely tempted to just say ""screw it"", start wearing hair barrettes and bands, and let the chips fall where they may - I'm now letting my itty-bitty sideburns grow their hair length and it won't be long before those hairs can be swept over my ears.  People are going to start drawing conclusions (I think) before too much longer or I'll need to try to manage that process. Either way, I'm estimating that I have until sometime next Spring (April or May) to figure out my coming out strategy.

JordanLimmer,asktransgender,I have a very strong feeling that I'm trans. Second opinion?,"NSFW

Having a bit of trouble with some recent developments in my perception of self, and I think I know the answer to my question. However, I want to ask this question somewhere as a rehearsal before I publicly let people know the truth.

I'm AMAB, but have never held gender roles in high regard. I wear both men's and women's clothing from time to time, all depending on my mood and how safe I feel. (Anxiety is high, so it's a somewhat rare occurrence.)  Dresses and other trappings of femininity provide me a sort of comfort and satisfaction that men's clothes don't, but I'm unsure if that's just because I have to be in an otherwise comfortable place to wear them.

Futhermore, (this is that juicy, embarrassing NSFW bit by the way), I'm rather uncomfortable with my genitals. I honestly wish it wasn't there, and find it quite annoying. As a child, I would refuse to look at it, but after all these years it's more of a dull disgust. I'm happy with the way that the rest of me looks (relatively), not really desiring breasts, and being more or less ambivalent to the idea of changes to my face.

That's what I want to get off my chest in the real world. I apologize for the selfish post."

Online, I'm out 24/7. It's extremely comfortable and I love it. Offline, I grew my hair out but hide it whenever I go outside. I've been trying to get HRT for 5+ years unsuccessfully, and only now am I on a gender identity clinic waitlist.

I've read up and watched a ton about many different peoples' experiences transitioning and a consistent pattern I can find is that it always gets harder, that being trans is an uphill battle for the rest of your life. Well, I can't even handle life before being trans. Sometimes I think I should just give up on this wild dream and be content with being a dude but I know I'll probably off myself faster that way.

My voice is incredibly deep, I'm fat as hell, I'm too tall to ever pass well, my hair is far too light for laser, and my depression isn't suddenly going to be solved with HRT. I tear up whenever I think about how hard voice therapy will be, and I know that it's often said that it's twice as hard to get in and stay in shape when on HRT. No antidepressant I have ever tried has worked and every therapist I've ever been with has been useless for me. I feel like in the war that is being trans I'm just going to be yet another casualty on the front lines.

In the end I just feel like I shouldn't even try, and should just end my pathetic existence now.

""I..... I want to be a woman. I have for a long time. There's no question about that. I believe I'd live a happier, more fufilling life as a woman. ""

But is that the right thing to say? 

Or should I just say I'm Uncomfortable with my body and appearance and try to find another solution?"

Hatbraze,asktransgender,Parents not as accepting as I initially thought. What do i do?,"So, a few days ago, my mom went in my room and found my makeup and wig, and they approached me that night and basically wouldn't let me leave until I came out. So I did, and they said they still love me, they'll help however they can even if they don't understand, that they're sorry I've had to go through this, etc...

Well, yesterday they sit me down and start asling tons of questions. ""are you sure"" ""you never acted like a girl"" ""you're going to be relegating yourself to low income jobs"" ""maybe you're just depressed again"" ""we're going through the stages of grief because we've lost our son"". 

Now, they prefaced this conversation with ""we're sorry if we say anything thats offensive, we're just trying to be more knowledgable and we don't know all the right things to say."" 

I'd like to think that, and surely I'm biased, but it just feels like bullshit to me, especially when they start talking about how hard this is for THEM. 

I don't know, all this has done is make me want to try harder to work towards getting to a new therapist and paying on my own, since they've made it abundantly clear that they won't pay for it if my goal is to get a letter for HRT. They want me to ""get my head right"" first.

I guess I'm just trying to ask ya'll what to do. I'm pissed off and not thinking straight right now, and don't know how much of my frustration is warranted. "
pretty_lady88,asktransgender,"Hey guys and gals, what are your thoughts on Portland?","I'm a lesbian transgender woman in her late twenties. I recently moved to Portland about two months ago and my experiences haven't been that great.

The first thing that happened when I got off the plane was I got called (more precisely, yelled) the ""f"" slur.

Whenever I would go to the supermarket, downtown, or anywhere really, people would say (or sometimes yell) the f slur at me.

Is this a common occurrence here in Portland? I've also been called a queer and a homo a lot, and misgendered so much it's not even funny. 

I would like to think I pass fairly well with 6 years of hormones on my belt, but people do a double take when I tell them my name or show them my license (which has a female name and gender) which I don't understand.

It makes me feel that unless you pass 100% flawlessly like a cis woman, they'll think you're a man in drag.

I live in Southwest Portland near downtown if that makes any difference, but I've experienced discrimination even in the bars and stores near the Q center.

Also, what makes it confusing is why do they use the ""f"" slur? why not the ""t"" slur? I'm personally not attracted to men, so it just feels even more offensive than it should because they can't even get their facts straight... what made them decide trans people are all f*g**ts all of a sudden??

I've known I was trans for about a year now, ever since I was young I've wanted to be a woman but I've just kind of shrugged it off as I was pushed to be a strong, tough man like society wants you to be. But I now see who I am and I want to be a woman more than ever, however my guardians are holding me back. A bunch.

I live with my grandparents, parents aren't in the picture, but my grandparents are basically my parents. They are blatant racists, homophobes, transphobes, the list goes on. (I've tried to change them, but I found out 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks' is very true.) basically, If you aren't white and straight they probably hate you. 
I am scared to death to come out to them. I'm sure they'd send me to a some sort of therapist that'll tell me how I am a man and I can't change it. I am still in high school and I don't want to be kicked out or disowned, and yes, I think they'd even go to that extent. I hang out with a bunch of girls in school, they don't know that I'm trans, but from what I've talked about with them, I think they'd support me. i have some internet friends from Texas (I'm from PA) that support me and I know it sounds lonely but I've known them for about 3-4 years now and they know me better than anyone.

ShakeBunny100489,asktransgender,Lots of problems dilating. Please help.,"Hi gals.

So, I'm about three months post op from Chet. Since day one I've been having lots and lots of trouble dilating.

Even three months in and I'm still using the ""0"" dialator. It hurts so so much, and that's coming from someone who generally does not have trouble with pain. Starting out I had six inches of full depth. Since then I've degraded to less than five, despite diligent, extended dilation.

I'm so frustrated and discouraged at this point. Having adequate depth is very important to me, and I feel like even though I'm doing everything I can to make things work the way they are supposed to I keep having more and more complications.

I had a doctor's appointment today here in nyc, and my doctor agrees with Chet in that I just need to keep at it. How can that be right if I'm losing depth so quickly? Does it come back? At this rate sex isn't possible and I'm genuinely starting to worry it's never going to be. My doctor's don't seem concerned about depth, although they have admittedly told me post op care is not something anyone really knows how to help with, even here such a large city.

TLDR: Dilating hurts way more than I feel it should typically, no one can tell me why, and I'm losing significant depth daily despite a proper dilation schedule and technique. Please, please offer any advice you can to help. I want to cry this is so not what I had in mind with surgery. Thanks everyone."

scalyimata,asktransgender,How long could I go on hormones in secret?,"So I live with my parents because I don't make enough to live on my own, I was wondering how long I could go on hormones without my parents getting too suspicious about me.

About a year ago (I was a senior in high school) I came out to them after attempting to kill myself. They basically said I wasn't trans and then got a therapist who after I looked them up realised was very anti-trans so I lied and said there were no gender related issues. My parents asked why I lied and I told them ""because"" and left it at that. And ever since then they've basically acted as if I never said anything. 

Honestly, I don't think my mum would care, she'd get over her own grief/doubts/etc. because she's amazing like that, and is pretty supportive of lgbt people in general. My dad though is extremely anti-trans (but has nothing against lgb people) and makes extremely problematic comments about women looking like men, and uses slurs like ""tr*nny"" and calls trans women men.

So obviously I don't want them to know, so how long could I go on HRT before it becomes hard to explain the changes away?"
Malkria,asktransgender,The devil's advocate?,"I think I am lucky enough to work with a night shift that seems OK with talking about the weirder and unusual aspects of life. Heck we had a whole conversation about swingers at one point. But one nurse I work with pointed out that the trans community seems to eager to rush forward with the prospect of transitioning.

Personally...I think I agree. When I was first starting out the mentality I came across was that if you didn't have to, don't transition. It's long, hard, painful, expensive, and chances are will completely alter your life and not necessarily for the better. In short, you had to be in the position that if you didn't transition it was just to painful to live. I hit that wall, and while my life isn't exactly 'better' I am far more at peace even stalled in my transition then I was when I started.

But when I see people giving kids hormones I get the hesitation. On one hand, yeah in my case it would have worked out wonderfully. But not every kid should be pushed to transition, and not every boy or girl who expresses displeasure at being their birth sex should be encouraged to transition. Nor should every person who comes to the forums asking ""am I transgender"" should, it seems, be met with ""yes"". 

I'm not saying people can't be transgender unless they are suicidal. Or that kids can't know from an early age they are different fundamentally from others (I hate the 'wrong body' phrasing). Or that people shouldn't be encouraged to explore their identity in, hopefully, safe places.

But as a transsexual woman I feel that if I am becoming hesitant at the push that I see now with kids, and trends on the internet with forums such as this...what must be going through people's minds that have little to no knowledge about the transgender condition?"
Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I'm feeling frustrated,"Hello everyone, as the title says I am feeling very frustrated right now.  I'm frustrated because I feel like I cannot tell any friend of mine about my transition without losing a friend.  I came out to two people recently, and I have not heard from them since.  It's so frustrating and lonely, I feel like the people who are still my friends wouldn't be friends with me if they knew that I  was really a girl.

This thought caused me to feel really closed off when I visited my grandparents this past week.  To give a small background, they are very conservative and religious.  I remember my grandma being very homophobic last time I had visited her.  I felt like if they knew who I was, then they wouldn't love me like they say they do.  Also, I feel that after I come out, I'll be nothing more to them than a family joke.  I hope that's not true, but I feel like it is.

It is also hard to be happy and open around my family too.  To give a small backstory, my mother was recently  (about two months ago) talking about divorcing my dad.  It does not seem like a good time to tell them.  Also, I feel like they will secretly hate me after I tell then that I am trans.  It's so hard to be happy around them knowing that.

It's a full year before I move out for college, so I won't be able to move out until then.  I want so badly to transition, but it kills me that everyone I am friends with will leave me once I do.  I feel awful, I want my friends back, and I want to transition.  It just feels like I can't do any of these things right now.

I socially transitioned already based on positive feed and go places...I even go to a Unitarian church as myself under the impression that no one could tell I was trans.

I was at a party sat night after laser and couldn't even enjoy it I felt like the ugliest person there.

I think I've mentioned it before but I came out at a young age and was sent to a very abusive conversion  camp where I was beaten and told I was too ugly to transition.

I had gotten over it but after that comment I keep hearing that preacher telling me how ugly I am in my mind....

It's not so much that I am unhappy with myself (after surgery I won't really have that much dysphoria) but I still have to live with being trans, knowing that 16 years of my life was wasted and does nothing for me but cause nausea. My neo vagina won't be like a cis girls. I will still always worry about someone clocking me or treating me different for something that I couldn't help. I can be okay with myself but the world can't be okay with me. I feel unwelcome and unsafe in the world.

I just want relief and it doesn't seem to be coming. I'm afraid I won't make it to see myself complete transition and honestly, even if I do it won't change how society views transgender people. I just feel like death is the only way I will truly be able to get the life I want. Even as backwards as that sounds. "
gabsaur,asktransgender,Cyproterone and sweating? Possible alternatives?,"Hey all. I've been on estradiol valerate for 18 months now and cyproterone acetate for 6, and while it's great for what I initially wanted an anti androgen for, I have also found that there are some (2, mainly) side effects that I'm really not too happy with.

My primary issue is the sweating. I had thought when I started HRT that I might sweat less, if anything. But now I wake up and the back of my neck is wet. I play roller derby, and find my head especially sweats way more than I used to, and it leaves me feeling dehydrated faster and with my glasses slipping off. I'm really not liking this side effect at all.

The secondary issue is that there is this whole lack of orgasm thing. Like, where you get to the point where you would normally orgasm, and... nothing happens. I thought I'd be okay with it for a while but now that I'm actually in a sexual relationship it is irritating and makes me feel broken. I've read that this is more a cyproterone thing than anything else. I can live with or without this really, the sweating is the thing that really gets me. 

In any case, I have an appointment with my GIC doctor during the week and I'm planning to bring it up. Is spiro the only alternative? Is that as good as an antiandrogen as cyproterone? Anybody have any advice here?"
Dammit-Hannah,asktransgender,Do I have to drop off the Earth in order to climb back up?,"I really want to transition, but one of the (many) things I'm worried about, and my parents/friends are worried about, is me disappearing. I don't want to have my old life be different from who i am now - I've gotten to do so many things that in some fashion, I still want my past male life to be a part of me. I don't mind people knowing my dead name (in fact I don't want to call it a dead name, just an ""old name""), though I'm probably saying that because I haven't actually transitioned.

Any redditors feel similarly? Is there a way around it, or is a complete disappearing act a necessary evil?"

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,Anyone know if Cigna insurance has changed their policies or something recently?,"I've only had this insurance with Cigna since around Feb of this year. Last time I picked up my T prescription, I had to pay a $20 copay. Today, however, I had to pay nothing. Even with my last insurance it always cost me $5. Even before I was on hrt, and I was taking birth control, I had to pay $5 for that on my old insurance too. At the pharmacy today I had my card out waiting to be prompted to pay, but the pharmacist said nothing about needing to pay. I looked at the receipt when I got home and sure enough it said .00 money was due at time of payment. I was with my friend, and we were both really confused about it not costing anything. I have called Cigna in the past about their coverage of hrt and surgeries, and they've always been kind of negative and non-inclusive. Is having hrt fully covered normal for more inclusive insurance plans? Is Cigna finally changing their policies to be more inclusive? Or with more inclusive insurance do you usually still have to pay a small copay (like $5), and thus is this super weird that it cost nothing today? I'm just kind of confused because this has never happened with any prescriptions for anything whether it be hrt, birth control, antidepressants, even the pain meds when I had my wisdom teeth out had a small copay.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Silly question about waning dysphoria,"If you've read my recent posts you know that I'm all over there place lately. But there's one thing that's getting new tripped up more than anything else. Especially today. It's the stupid body dysphoria stuff. I know it comes and goes, and I never really had terrible dysphoria about my body until 9 months ago or so. But I'm like a month in to HRT and lately I'm not hating it as much. And it still looks very male, except that I'm starting to get some minor breast growth. Which is awesome.

So, I know this is probably a silly question, but is this some sign I should stop?

Like, I don't want to. And when I think about it I generally either get sad or angry. I'm actually feeling super calm today and it's weird because I'm feeling pretty confident that I am a woman. Deep inside me, and I can still feel it, is the desire to be a woman.

Am I getting too hung up on the physical aspects of this?"

I can't quite find the answer I am looking for. I had laser on Friday and afterwards my hair just looked kinda dead on my face for a few days. It is ""growing"" very slowly and much of the hair has a bumpy translucent skin around the base. I tried shaving but cannot get it close. I was resolved to be patient but everyone at work today commented on my goatee which kind made me want to  kill myself (not really, but almost). 

I suppose my question is is this normal? I just want to prepare myself for going through this seven to ten more times. I feel like a freak with my budding boobs and goatee (my facial hair is cursedly much denser in that area).

AdaGirl,asktransgender,I love my dad,"I was having a conversation with my dad about what kind of treatment I was interested in when he told me:

""Now, my dear daughter, I know you've probably researched what to expect regarding being transgender very thoroughly, but I'm pretty sure there's something you're not aware of. We can both agree you're a flaming nerd, yes? Good, that means you stand before two choices: either you need to dye your hair red and make it really greasy, become way skinnier, and acquire a pair of huge glasses, or you need to gain at least 50 kilograms, because those are the only two types of nerd girls that exist. I know this, because I went to college with both of these.""

Wannabkate,asktransgender,What is the thing that confirms that you are transgender?,"So whenever I question if I am trans or not I think about the one thing that confirms it for me. This is really personal but I think that sharing it is important.

When I was 13 or 14, I tried to cut it off. I tried to cut off my penis. I tried with a knife. I still have a scar.  Before that I have tried many methods to remove the offending body part. Thank goodness I didnt succeed, that would have killed me. I was an idiot.

What normal boy does that? The answer is they don't. If that doesn't mean I am trans, nothing else never will.

shoelaze,asktransgender,What if I just really like girls?,"Ok so this is kind of a weird one but it's late and I'm tired and confused and sad (although I'm usually tired and confused and sad). Basically I've been worrying that maybe I think I'm trans just because:

 a) I find girls really attractive and myself really unattractive therefore to be attractive I must be girl. This carries onto body stuff where it's like do I want boobs to grab and shake and jiggle around or do I want a girl who's boobs I can grab and shake and jiggle around; do I want a body like her or do I want her body etc... I kinda described this confusion in a previous post but it's still really heavy...

b) I think girls are kind of just better than guys, like whenever I wanted to or felt like I aligned mentally and emotionally with women it's just because I think that's a better way to be... This sorta extends to estrogen too like I remember being a kid and being happy in science or phts ed or whatever when I found out boys had some estrogen in them too because it's obviously the better one, and like now if my body was completely neutral and genderless and I had to pick a hormone it would more than likely be estrogen, definitely not testosterone...

c)I don't directly get jealous of women, if I do it's wrapped up in like a ball of attraction and being impressed and really it just comes out at first as like 'woah that girl is cool as shit' while it's much rarer for guys to strike me this way, like I very rarely see guys I'd want to be 'like'...

Idk I'm gonna cut it short there because I keep losing my train of thought, I think I got the gist out anyway...
Idk I feel like I expressed this really badly but hopefully it's clear enough that if someone recognises this they can chime in. If I need to clarify anything I'll probs be up for another hour or so to help. Thanks ����❤"

fullofsadandpanic,asktransgender,Can't figure out 'the right time',"Well, my throwaway account name is far less apt than the last post I made, but it'll be easier to just have one account for this sort of thing.

I currently feel stuck in a holding pattern. I've mostly accepted that I can get past my height, shoulders and chest and go for transitioning, but...I am not doing anything.

Do I tell my parents whom I live with? Do I bug my therapist to get me more people and professionals to talk to before I breathe a word to my folks? I want to go back to school and do my Masters sometime in the next few years, should I start before, or after? 

I just overwhelm myself so much with options, that I get paralyzed with indecision. On one hand, I am constantly unhappy, miserable, depressed, and cannot motivate myself to get anywhere forward in life related to non-trans reasons, on the other hand I worry that trying to move forward on transitioning will cause chaos as far as my work and family life goes and I'll lose the small bit of stability still keeping me alive.

I just feel there is far far too much for me to take into account and sift through before I pick a 'when', nevermind starting to even consider the 'how'. 

Even still, with the school aspect...do I try to find a school that isnt local so I can 'start over' even if it will put me into more debt, or do I stay local, where I can live far more cheaply, have my parents as support, but risk people who know me....making a huge deal out of it. Honestly I haven't been socializing with locals for years, intentionally avoiding them where I can honestly, but...people still know me. 

I just spewed up a lot of words, I know. Bit of catharsis, even if no one has some helpful words to throw at me. "
FideNide,asktransgender,Finally told my parents. All hell broke loose.,"I'm a frequent reader but not a poster here. I finally built up the courage to go and tell them everything. I'm 16, born male but I'm a girl in every way on the inside.

I told my parents and older brother (he's 20) that I wanted to talk to them about something very serious yesterday. At night, we sat down and I told them everything. I was really hoping that they would accept.

My dad was shocked and then told me ""what went wrong?"". My mom told me that she doesn't understand because they were good parents so how can this be happening. My dad suggested that I he might not have done right to teach me how to be a man and he will make up for it. My mom suggested that I talk to our pastor about it and he can guide me into manhood. I know he's homophobic as fuck so I suspect he's transphobic as well.

So I tried telling them that it's not about their parenting or teaching me about being a man that this is something that's out of anyone's control but they weren't having it and they insisted that this is because of their failure in parenting. The question ""who would people think about us if they learn?"" came up.

My brother was amazing though he kept calming them down and asking them to just give it more thought and do more research. I initially didn't want to include him here as I suspected he won't be supportive but in the end I thought it's best to have everyone in the family in one place and do it once for all.

The whole thing ended with me going to my room crying and my parents being angry. Later that night my brother came my room and asked if his little ""sister"" wants a hug. Hearing that was amazing as I was very upset and actually thinking of doing something I might have regretted but he gave me a hug and talked to me for a couple of hours. He promised that he'll have my back and won't let our parents do anything crazy. He told me that he suspected this for a while and he saw me once with leftover nail polish on my fingers. He actually asked me a few times if there's something that I want to tell him and he can help. I never noticed it's what he means. He told me to tell him if I need anything or if I want to talk. It was so amazing to have his support.

So my parents told me today that they're grounding me indefinitely. They say this is the influence of one of my friends. It's not but they blame him. We're not even close friends. My parents have banned me from talking to any of my friends. They haven't taken my phone but they might.

My brother asked me today to pick a female name. He said it's now a little weird to call me with a male name.

I have horrible unsupportive parents but an awesome brother."

Wickiot,asktransgender,"Late bloomers, how did you feel when you realized you were incorrectly assigned?","So, it's been kind of an eerie week for me. I had the thought lingering on my mind for many years, settled into continuing to present male to the world, maintaining my little private habits, until I ran into an essay that flipped me upside down. I still didn't accept it, but then I thought I'd confront it with a very close friend whom I knew wouldn't freak out on me. Basically, she replied ""that's it! I knew something was off with you, but I couldn't figure it out!!"".

When I read that, I cried, but it also felt like a huge weight got just lifted off my chest. Since then, I have been through a rollercoaster of emotions, I keep up the front at work, but go from high as a kite, to terrified in minutes thinking about how much it will change my life. But at the same time, it just feels right and it's a massive drive, I went to my GP yesterday because I need to be referred to a therapist who has to issue a certificate to get to see an endo, I was waiting outside the office stressed as fuck, once he took me in, it just came out naturally, I told him about my intention and he discussed a little bit with me, nothing weird, then wrote the letter and told me to come to him anytime I needed healthcare. I was stocked! I'm still going through emotions like a hamster on speed, but I can't remember when I last felt this alive...

How about you?

EDIT: When I wrote ""late bloomers"", I didn't mean to discriminate, simply to narrow the question to those that didn't know it before puberty, but after some thinking, I can imagine pretty much anyone might have such an epiphany after being through hell, no matter how early they knew, if it makes any sense."
TGNK87,asktransgender,Why should we use inclusive language when posting on this subreddit?,"This was originally in reply to something someone posted in a previous thread on a throwaway account (so I'm not calling out anyone in particular), the original comment was deleted before I could reply so I figured I had already  spent a lot of time writing this and didn't want to waste it.   Plus it's a conversation a lot of people feel we need to have:

The commentor asked why people get so upset about the lack of inclusive language when asking a question directed to a specific sub-group and then stated that they did not like when people do this:  

&gt;""While I tend to agree with you on the idea that some posts and questions people have are more relevant to one particular group, and it shouldn't matter if you post a question directed towards others that have a more similar background for advice, here's where I think those asking for inclusion are coming from:  

&gt;Inclusion is already a sensitive and difficult matter for most trans people.  I'm sure most, if not all of us who are at least aware of being trans and out to people have faced some sort of discrimination in the form of exclusion from ""cis-spaces"" or just had an overall sense of ""other-ness"" while with cis people of one's preferred gender  (for lack of a better term, I personally don't like to use the the term ""preferred"" because it implies that there was some choice in the matter of being trans.. I digress)  

&gt;So when we come to a trans-friendly space, we hope that there will be inclusion and that we can interact with people with whom we identify and can be included in transition-related or trans-in-general discussions.  Unfortunately, AFAB transgender and non-binary people are highly outnumbered in these spaces compared to those of us AMAB.  And this, also unfortunately, tends to lead to just another sense of ""other-ness"" in a space that is supposed to be somewhere one can go to relate and be included in a community.  

&gt;I think it tends to stem from the fact that we as people relate to others using our own experiences. For most of us, that means growing up as a male, dealing with performing and acting as a male and experiencing male-bodied related dysphoria.   We tend to forget that there are people who would kill to have been born broad shouldered, barrel chested, big armed and covered in hair (gross, BTW  yuck idk why you guys want that nastiness ;p) that share the same space as us mtf (or in my case, mtwhatever) people.  

&gt;What can we as mtf people do to include our ftm and nb brethren? Well, we expect certain treatment and inclusion, and we should make a conscious effort to do the same for others.  We should realize we aren't the only ones that experience dysphoria and we aren't the only ones that get excluded.  Mtf people may have it a little tougher than ftm people on the front of, say, the ""bathroom issue"", but it doesn't make the struggles of ftm and non-binary people any lesser than our own (at least we have a process for srs that is somewhat accessable and leaves us with something that functions well and looks great) and we should be cognizant of that.  Making a conscious effort to include people in posts that they might actually be able to provide relevant and valuable information is really all it takes.  

&gt;That being said, if someone is mtf and feels that only someone who is mtf can answer their questions, then yeah, go for it.  Nobody should think the lesser of you for that and nobody really has a right to judge you for asking a directed question.  But there *are* times when we can work to include everyone that shares this space, not because we have to, but because it's the right thing to do.  

&gt;Sorry, I know this was a long post (most of mine tend to be) but I hope it helps a little.""

What are your thoughts on this issue?  Do you feel welcome here?  Do we as a community-at-large (all of reddit's trans-related subs) do enough to make *all* people feel welcome here?  What are some small and simple things anyone can do to help prevent alienation from the community?"
Taliva,asktransgender,Talking to my Pentecostal parents today (help),"I've put this off for 25+ years and am nervous af, especially w/ boymode failing hard and a visit from my mom and stepdad next week.

I have told my mom, about 2 years ago, but she brushed it off with ""I don't see that in you"". We went back to ignoring obviously feminine me and her worrying I'm a gay man. (I'm a lesbian, so lolwut?)

Lately over the past few months I think it has hit her, or she has repeatedly heard through the grapevine, that I am trans. So I am pretty sure they both know, but their method for dealing with things is not communicating anything upsetting. 

And they both have stressed that I am welcome to their home (yay, but my paranoia wonders if that extends to me as I know me, or if I will become a stranger in their eyes).

I've tried very hard to keep this away from them, I know they are ashamed, and my mom has told my dad that she won't accept me as anything other than a boy. Every time we talk, she makes sure to make a point of calling me son. 

I love my parents, they are good people, but they are not open-minded enough to accept LGBT people. I don't want to lose them from my life, but I have to live my life no matter what.

rebandvodka,asktransgender,Am I a bad person for not wanting to be seen as trans?,"(Before anything at all, I apologize in advance for possible bad English. Slowly but surely getting the hang of this. Also, this is probably very rambly/messy so I apologize for that too!)
I don't really post often, rather only commenting on things that interest me but this thought has been bugging me for a while and I don't exactly know where else I would receive helpful responses/opinions. 
I can just start by saying that I've known that I've wanted to transition for a while now. I'm currently pre-T, no surgery, out to my friends but not out to parents so imaginably, I have little resources and it's hard to work with what I've been given. I'm not allowed to cut my hair at all so that alongside my body type is really all that's keeping me from visibly passing but I'm not extremely concerned with that aspect. I know that as soon as I can be out on my own, that won't be a problem and there's not much I can even do about it right now. The thing that's been getting to me is just not really wanting to be trans.. or, known for being trans.

I don't want this to sound at all hateful because I've been ridiculed for saying this. I have nothing but respect for every sole being in the community and have to admire everyone's bravery-- obviously it's not that I have a problem with those who ARE trans, without a doubt not excluding those who are happy and comfortable about being open with that. To those who can be, that's amazing. But for me, I feel like it's different? I don't want people to know that I previously presented myself as and lived as a female. I don't want to be known as ftm, just male. And I know that if I were to be open about being trans to everyone I met or with everyone that got to see me/know me/understand what I do/whatever, they'd still have it in their mind that I'm ftm. Which, again let me clarify that being trans is not a bad thing AT ALL, I just have this fear that a majority of people who are probably less accepting of this wouldn't deem me as male. They'd just associate me with what I felt like I was or what I made myself look like in the past and I hate thinking about that.
I don't really know what I'm asking here but I'd like some kind of response, feedback and what not. Anything is probably helpful at this point. And if you stuck around to read this whole thing, not only am I sorry but thankful. I hope you're all doing well. "

So, basically, I wanted to ask if my current dosage is weird in any sense. My endo initially prescribed 2 mg estradiol and 50 mg spiro, but then doubled the estradiol dosage after ~3 months to get me to my current dosage of 4 mg estradiol and 50 mg spiro (daily). Does this seem a little low to anyone? It's been about seven months since I stared, and although there have definitely been some effects, there hasn't been anything super major, either. Should I ask her to raise it? My next appointment is relatively soon, so I definitely could try. Also, on a related note, I currently take everything orally (not sublingual, though). Should I consider switching to injections or something else? And, one last thing, but should I consider trying progesterone? I've had some breast development, but it's definitely a far cry from what I've seen some people get by now. Anyways, I'm super sorry for all the questions, and if you read all this thank you so so much!! Have a great day/night!!!"

axlbullet,asktransgender,advice on writing trans characters correctly?,"before i start, i'd like to mention that i am trans ftm myself, but due to my living conditions have not been able to change my name/appearance/etc. i'm looking to write a scenario where both characters are pre-op ftm trans, but neither know about the other being trans. one finds out about the other being trans and then tells them about being trans themselves, and they have a supportive talk about themselves, their identity, etc, because i am a giant cheeseball. my biggest problem is coming up with a scenario in which the character would find out about the other being trans without being offensive. like, i don't want to pull ""character walks in on trans character changing/showering/naked and sees their body, thus outing them"" thing, since i dont like that trope, and i dont think anyone does. sorry if this has been asked a million times, or is the wrong place to ask, but any advice or suggestions would be amazing."

anonymousTgirl,asktransgender,No visible missing hair but apparently I shed a lot. About 29 days on HRT at 27. Should I be worried? (Maybe a little NSFW details).,"Just that. At first I wasn't worried until my friend/roommate mentioned finding many strands of my long wavy hairs all over the place. For the record I am on Sphiro and Estradiol, and I seem to be getting several sure signs of very low testosterone and raising estrogen. I'm having almost black beard strands lightening up, breast sensitivity and inability to get erections so I am 99% sure the HRT is working.  The ONLY REASON I am remotely worried is because of my friend frequently finding strands of my hair in the most random of spots.

A bit more info: Ever since surviving appendicitis I suspected I got it from not drinking enough water, and I drink a lot of water every day, also I'm very skinny, I also may have a mild to severe vitamin D deficiency as I had almost no sunlight touching me for many years- probably over a decade to be honest.

Also my maternal grandpa AFAIK started getting MPB in his 30s, and my fathers father had a bald patch in the back, and his older brother is also severely balding now. Even though my father at like 60+ has no signs of MPB.

Before my friend mentioned my shedding I was thinking to myself, ""Well PHEW I started HRT before turning 30, so if I was getting frighteningly close to when my mothers father had it, I narrowly dodged the bullet"".

That all said, with my testosterone being so low, IF I am having hairloss and that's a big IF, I think a vitamin deficiency or me being too skinny is probably the reason why. Before starting HRT I did keep myself very skinny on purpose, hoping that very low body fat could act like a lesser testosterone blocker.

Now that I found out about being super skinny potentially causing hairloss, and now that I am also on HRT, I don't want to be skinny anymore. Keeping myself very skinny lowered dysphoria before HRT, but I think on HRT being very skinny makes my dysphoria worse, especially now that I'm worried about it causing hairloss.

When I told my therapist about this from what I remember, he said that ""Often the hair thins out in some places but gets thicker in others"". So does this mean I am likely alarmed over nothing, and that my hair is just getting thicker in the places it's usually thicker in women and thinner in the places it's usually thicker in men or something?

He did tell me I should still tell my doctor though. Am I likely starting to grow hair on my head I never had, and the shedding is just the start of that? Or is this all a false alarm and I just shed a lot cause I have so much hair to begin with?

Also another possible cause- about half a year ago I shampoo'd a lot and rarely conditioned it for several years, both cause I didn't know the dangers of over shampooing and my mom who I used to live with has a bizarre and very irritating phobia of hair grease and freaked out whenever my hair got even a bit oily... So it might be that my hair is simply breaking rather than the much scarier situation of the roots falling out. Also more evidence of this is I think is, my hair seems to be a lot more frizzy near the scalp with a bunch of hairs of various uneven lengths. AFAIK I do have a bunch of frizzy split ends and it gets worse the closer to my scalp said hair is.

As someone who has always been very skinny, and is worried about hairloss due to being too skinny, I am also now trying to gain weight very quickly. Oh and uh I am on a half estro dose atm, but in the very near future per doctors orders will be doubling it.

Even before this became a concern my plan was to be on sphiro/estrogen for a year, then get my orchiectomy so my body can no longer produce enough testosterone to make me dysphoric then after the orchie just go on estrogen alone... In theory worst case situation, should that all combined guarantee an almost 99% chance of immunity to MPB? 

I'm hoping this is either A a nutritional deficiency/ B overtly shampoo'd hair that is easily fixed, or C I managed to get on HRT before MPB had the chance to threaten my hair, and that either the shedding stops soon or isn't related to permanent hairloss.

Anyways um... Anyone with similar experiences or what you suspect is behind this? I'm gonna tell my doctor either way, though I'm feeling quite insecure right now, and I'd really like to hear what you suspect is going on or if something similar happened to you, so I feel less in the dark, and have a better idea of what's going on."

bearshasp,asktransgender,Having Doubts?,"Hi, first time poster. Recently I've finally the fact that I am MtF transgender, and even came out to select friends and family. Yet I keep doubting myself, that I might just be unintentionally deceiving myself into wanting this? But then when I really think, I remember that I've wanted this since I was a little kid.
Even as a teenager I was struggling with this, but it was different back then.

I grew up in a mormon household, so I felt bad for wanting to be a girl. Like it was the wrong thing to do, but I couldn't help it. Back then it was about fighting it. I tried to be the best man I could and it wasn't bad, but I wasn't happy. Every night I wished I would wake up as a girl, just as I always have. Now that I realize that this is just a part of me, and I will always want this, I know I have to reach for my own happiness right?

But the doubt always comes with everything that I do. That I will never be good enough. That I will never be as good or as pretty as a cis girl. That I've been a boy for too long and can't change, or that I already look too masculine and I will just turn out ugly. All these doubts bum me out.

I feel like deep down I know that I am transgender, but these recurring negative doubts make me discouraged. Perhaps its lingering guilt from mormonism?

Futurist110,asktransgender,Using women's restrooms,"I am an aspiring cross-dresser/transvestite (I first need to fix my body and face) and I was wondering what exactly I should do in a future situation where I will be cross-dressing and will need to go to the restroom.

Indeed, if there is a gender-neutral restroom, then I feel like I should certainly use that restroom (indeed, I mostly identify as male but otherwise have strong feminine inclinations).

Meanwhile, if there are only two restrooms (male and female), then I certainly feel compelled to use the women's restrooms (regardless of the legality of this); after all, the risk of getting beaten and/or killed up by some violent transphobe in the men's restroom is simply not a risk that I am willing to take. (Indeed, if someone tries daring to sue me for this, then I will certainly try taking up this case all of the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court!)

How can I stop beating myself up for being lonely, alone and unlovable all the time?","Not quite sure if this is the right sub to post this kind of question in since it isn't necessarily a trans issue, but I feel my being trans might be contributing to it.

Long story short: I'm in my mid 20's now and have been transitioning for over a year. I pass all the time which feels great. And many other aspects my life seems to be better than ever as well. I'm clean now after abusing drugs for quite a long time, I have started getting an education with the prospect of studying next fall and I also got a well paying job without prior experience. Even more importantly than that I finally made two good friends after being isolated from all of society for many years.

Everything seems to be going great except for the fact that I've never had a single relationship in my life. I don't care about sex (which is still a very difficult issue anyway), all I want is to find out what love feels like. Seeing kids a decade younger than me have more experience hurts a lot. I don't think other people lie awake at night wondering what it feels like to be kissed or even just hugged. 

I have made some pretty bad experiences and on days like these where I don't have to work and nobody to meet I feel particularly vulnerable about it. It seems to be impossible for me to meet someone in real life, I tried visiting a few LGBT groups and although I met a bunch of wonderful people and also a few other gay women, it appears as though everyone I meet is either in a happy relationship already or just isn't interested in me. 

Which leaves only one other option for me, online dating. Never liked the idea of it. It took a while after creating my profile to get in contact with someone, but at least it happened. We chatted back and forth about this and that and eventually I told her that I was trans which was no problem for her. I was happy and hopeful for the first time in my life. After a few days of writing we decided to meet in person, considering my social anxiety this was a huge step for me, it didn't go great but it could have gone a lot worse. We kept in touch and continued texting until one day she suddenly stopped responding. One minute she was passionately talking about her hobby, the other she simply didn't reply anymore. -

Now, the reason I'm mentioning this is because this exact thing happened with literally all my attempts at online dating. All of them seem to be completely fine with the fact that I'm trans (at least they say so). As of now I had 5 different women stop responding to me for no apparent reason. It's difficult for me to convey just how much it hurts to be ignored/dumped like that. The last one was the worst though... She literally ran away from me while I was on the toilet. At least she had the decency to leave 5 bucks to pay for her cup of coffee. The only time I was able to stop crying after that was when I was distracted by work or a good game.

After all this I feel completely hopeless and desperate and I'm probably not going to try anytime soon again. I don't see what I have done wrong or maybe there is something deeply wrong with me that I just can't see. I don't know. If only these women told me the reason why they left/stopped answering it would be much easier for me to identify how I can improve myself.
My friends keep telling me to keep putting myself out there and someday I might succeed. They say it's a long process and I shouldn't lose hope, but neither of them had to put up with this much rejection and confusion. They don't understand, which is the reason I'm posting this here. 

Sorry for the long rant, I really just wanted to ask if some of you have had similar incidents and can tell me how to best deal with them emotionally. I'm sure things would simply repeat if I tried again, so I'm thinking I should learn how to handle these things better."

My hair is extremely masculine - basically thick wires that stand straight up no matter what I do with them. I've always wanted long hair, but long in the ""affected by gravity"" sense rather than in the afro sense. It's my understanding that it's possible for me to do some sort of chemical treatment to ""relax"" my hair so that it will lay down, and then I can hopefully grow it out a bit and it will look more feminine. I'm having trouble learning more about this process, though, or figuring out how to get stared with it, and it would mean the world to me if someone had some helpful advice.

I want it to be my own hair rather than a wig if at all possible. This has always been a dream of mine... also, I figure this is a good place to start because a lot of men these days have long feminine hair, so I don't necessarily have to come out yet.

ankle-socks,asktransgender,Are there any 'massive electrolysis' places (like E3K) on the eastern seaboard (USA)?,"Tried a search but didn't get much. keyword suggestions welcome. 



I have unwanted facial hair and I have some money. I'm also in grad school and I don't have a lot of time. I live on the eastern seaboard (philadelphia, specifically). If I fly out to dallas to get a bunch of electrolysis done, it will be relatively time efficient (most people seem to say their face is cleared after like 6 sessions?). But E3K is already expensive and i'd be paying a $300+ overhead for a round trip ticket and a night or two at a hotel each time. 

If there were some place on the eastern seaboard or nearby, this would be better. Even if they're known to be willing to book for a four-hour session with one good electrologist, it would be helpful. 



Before you suggest laser, I'm rather blonde and my skin is pale. It think this sucks! If you suggest laser anyway, well, tell me why.



Also, altruism suggests to me that if you know of another place, in any country or location that does this kind of electrolysis (where you lay down and are tortured by probably more than one electrologist for an extended period), maybe post it anyway so that people who search in the future can find it.

Thr0w4w4y4ccazbuka,asktransgender,How do I tactfully acknowledge a character being FTM in a fantasy novel?,"Throwaway account because I don't want to be a target on my main. 

Hi! I'm writing a fantasy novel. I myself am agender but said character is FTM. I'm trying to acknowledge this tactfully.

It's kind of a sticky circumstance (he almost suffocates. Other (cis female) character cuts his tunic off help him breathe. Discovers a makeshift binder and has to cut that off too. His suffocation is traumatic war injury related and is not due to the binder). He survives. 

Trans*ness in this culture isn't looked down upon, hated, or feared since it's not seen as wrong (fantasy world), though it is uncommon to talk about it. I don't think glossing over it is the right approach though, given the desire and need for strong trans* characters in fiction. Any ideas? Should I just not mention it and do something similar to what JK Rowling did with Dumbledore, where he was revealed to be gay after the books? I don't want to do it wrong and/or insult anybody. 

His storyline isn't directly related to him being trans. It ties in to a few comments he makes at the beginning of his arc, but that's about it. 

One of my friends said I should mention it because of the lack of good trans characters in (especially fantasy) fiction. I agree, but since his arc isn't solely focused on his trans-ness I don't want to mention it to mention it. My other friend (FTM) said ""...I feel you should reference towards it maybe once or twice...This is kind of what people really need is more canon trans people in books especially fantasy that isn't just focusing on them being trans."" 

I want to get a few more opinions before I carry on. I know I can't please everyone, but I want to have a good grasp on it before I continue the story. 

Tl,dr: FTM fantasy character nearly suffocates. Cis character cuts shirt off to aid respiration. Discovers binder. Cuts that off too. How do I acknowledge this within the scene and keep it tactful?"

-Jen-,asktransgender,High Estrogen on Injections / Help,"Ok, so I know this thread type gets posted a lot, my apologies.....

My levels are a little on the high side with injections.

988 pmol/l  -or-  269 pg/ml

My SHBG is - 156

My bloods were taken on the 6th day, so 1 day before my next weekly injection. My guess is on injection day my levels would be astronomical.

I take Progynon Depot. One vial per week at 1ml/10mg

I hear many times how high estrogen can hinder development....but not sure where the evidence comes from?

Is it because of the receptors? or the high SHBG? or thyroid??..what comes into play to make estrogen less effective at a higher dose??

I know high estrogen has its own laundry list of issues by itself, so thats why I ask this questions also.

I worry sometimes that although I feel fairly ok,..these high levels may be hindering my development, and I should lower it, but I have no evidence to back it up. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. xx

emilycdcanada,asktransgender,I want to gain weight but how long should I wait?,"Hello! I'm trying to figure out when I should start gaining a little weight and I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with this.

Before starting HRT I intentionally spent 2-3 months losing weight quickly to get rid of the male fat. I'm 5'11.5"" and started at 160lbs and am now at 138lbs. During my teenage years I normally hovered around 150lbs, so for me this is pretty low. There have been some nice benefits, such as most of the muscle in my body is gone, I have a defined waist, my arms and legs are small. But there has also been a drawback--the fat in my mid cheek area has reduced and I have a more gaunt look to me.

I've only been on HRT for 1.5 months, but I just received blood work results back recently and my levels are very good already--estradiol 357 pg/ml (bit high I suppose), testosterone 24.5 ng/dl (taking 6mg estradiol hemihydrate sublingually, 75mg cyproterone acetate). I also already have some visible breast growth so I know my body is responding.

So.. is my body ready for more weight now or not? Ideally I'd like to put on 7-10lbs to start with and see if it helps my face. Would it be safer to wait until say the 2nd or 3rd month mark instead? If so, why would I be waiting if my levels are already in range? Help! :)

throwaway250738,asktransgender,Hormones vs self medicating with drugs cost,"Hi I've been on hormones for awhile but from a combination of stuff like moving countries and hating being transsexual I have been trying so hard to be comfortable with detransitioning. I will probably have to get high a lot though to emotionally deal with things when I detransition. Hormones cost me around $350-$400 USD equivalent WITH insurance with no other insurance options here within a price range that would make financial sense. The medical coverage has to be through the government even with employers basically. It's complicated just know that I do not have an alternative to paying that amount, I've tried. I figure it'll be cheaper to self-medicate by getting high but I've only ever gotten high through extremely sporadic pain medication prescriptions when I was legit in pain.

So my question is that do you think it is financially worth it to detransition and self medicate rather than continue to take hormones? I know there are dangers associated with getting high, and if you make a list of them I can say that I sincerely don't care about all or most of them.

By the way I do not want to move back to the country I came from, and advice to simply move continents (which I would have to do since this country probably has the best trans care on the continent full of horrible places for trans people) is not an option unless you personally intend to fund the thousands of pounds, euros, dollars, etc to do so. I purely want to know about financial costs of two different kinds of medication; I hope I stressed that enough."

MaybeAngela,asktransgender,How high is to high for E2 levels?,"I have been on HRT officially since February 20th of this year. My Dr. prescribed 200mg Spiro per day and 20mg of Estradiol Valerate every two weeks via IM injection. She also doesn't think that Progesterone is a benefit to trans women but she did leave the door open to it, she said we could discuss it later after I had been on HRT for a little while. 

My last two blood tests for Estrogen where both high, 487 pg/ml in late May and 514 pg/ml in late September. My T levels were 17 and 15 ng/dl respectively. My blood sample both times was drawn five days before my next injection, so pretty late in my cycle. I know the target level for E2 is supposedly 200 pg/ml. I didn't get tested for Progesterone but my prolactin levels were 10.5 ng/ml and 8.1 ng/ml. I don't even know if prolactin is relevant in this case. My Dr. didn't think these levels where a problem at all, and I would tend to agree with her as I feel great and haven't had any negative effects other than one little thing. About six weeks ago my hair started shedding like crazy. I was starting to freak out about it so I was googling hair loss/shedding and kept finding references to Estrogen dominance causing hair shedding if E2 was to high, or your Estrogen / Progesterone ratios where thrown out of alignment.

So what do any of you think about to high of estrogen causing hair shedding? I just want to add that I have never had long hair before and everyone I know personally that has long hair and that I have asked about my shedding levels has assured me that my hair looks the same and that my shedding is normal and that Im freaking out about nothing.

ThroawayGus92,asktransgender,Family first odd name.,"I want to preface by saying my family is fully on board with my transition.  I've had zero problems except on this issue, and it's more a bit of Irish, family pride.

I'll preface this with history.  A century or so ago we had a REALLY Catholic family member who named her numerous kids after various famous Catholic saints or theologians or ideals. I have an uncle named ""Pious"" for example.  It's odd and kinda funny.

One of the prominent ones has been Augustine.  That's my dad's name (He's a junior) and my male name (I'm a third).  He's ""Auggie"" while I grew up ""Gus.""

The issue here is I LIKE my nickname.  My family feels connected, and my dad has actively lobbied me to keep it even while supporting me.  ""Augusta"" has popped up here and there in extended family as the female version and I like that, but I'm seriously worried that it's waaaay too oddball (as well as going by ""Gus"") to pass.

She has dealt with trans people before and learned alot through those clients. 

And whether through her words or mine, I'm convincing my dad that transition Is right for me.

I'm excited and scared and kinda depressed at the moment, I feel like I want to throw up from stress right now, so i've decided to type a little note to inspire myself and maybe it'll inspire one of you:

I'm Olivia, I'm a senior in high school who intends to go into the industry of media production. I was born male and have spent the past 17 years living as one. And I don't regret a GODDAMN second of it. These past 17 years have made me who I am, and I Won't ever forget them.

But moving forward, it's time to make a change. It's time to get my body more in line with how I truly feel. I'm not gonna live my life staying as a man who hates himself and knows that no matter what he acomplishes he will always have a part of him feeling empty. I want to live as a woman. I want to Live as who I know I truly am, deep down from the bottom of my heart.


I'm not doing this because im some kind of ""pervert"" or because I'm looking for an excuse to run away from my current life. I'm doing it because I want to be true to myself and express myself how I want to. I don't want to hide anymore.


I'm not James, I'm not a man. I'm Olivia. I'm a woman. And anyone who can't Come to accept that can leave my life. I know who I am. I'm not confused. I'm not putting a label on myself and I'm not jumping to conclusions(Dad), all that matters is that I know I'm a woman and I want to change my body to match that.

I know that physically becoming a woman isnt a magic silver bullet. But that's not the point. I don't want a perfect, always happy life as a woman, because that's not what life Is all about. But I will be successful and I will make something of myself, AS ME, AS OLIVIA.

Well that's all I can think to say. I'm thinking of Sharing that with my dad and therapist. But anyway, I hope that this helped someone out, whether they're questioning, on HRT, Stealth, or whatever."
Shining_Lights,asktransgender,Worried about Endocrinolgist.... :/,"Hello, awesome people! I've been lurking this reddit just about everyday and I've learned lots from a lot of the discussions that go on. 

So...I'm 23 and I've been on MTF HRT for a while (maybe 3 months?). I'm supposed to meet up with my endocrinologist for a follow up soon but had to delay it for a bit due to work. I've been thinking of switching to injections because it'll be a lot more convenient for me rather than having to take pills transbuccally everyday (what I'm doing now) and I'm used to taking injections so it's not a problem for me. So I call up the endocrinologist and she says she ""Doesn't do injections due to increased chances of blood clots. Now, I know a whole lot of people doing injections and are doing just fine and I don't think pills would be any ""safer"" than injections. By the tone of her voice she...sounds reluctant to increase dosage even for estradiol pills, which is absurd because I'm only on 2mg Estradiol with the 100mg spiro twice a day. She said we will discuss increasing dose and switching to injections after my next blood test but I have a bad feeling she's gonna pull some conservative dosage bullshit on me. I do not smoke nor drink nor have any current cholesterol problems that'll aggravate HRT side effects. My levels are:

T =  8.9 nmol/L (257ng/dL)
E2 = 137pmol/L (37.32pg/mL)

Doesn't even come close to fitting into any of the recommended ranges that I've seen.

So I guess the question I have is, do you guys know of any reputable sources that indicate the preferred T and E2 levels for MTF HRT and, more importantly, sources that compare the risks between pills and injections? (I'm fairly certain that injections have less risks than what she thinks) I want to bring this stuff up to her and convince her to switch me to injections or at least increase the pill dose. Please don't just say ""do whatever your endo says, she knows what's good for you blah blah blah.."" because I don't necessarily agree with it.

Sean_NH,asktransgender,Question for Females born Male-bodied; Do you feel cis-gendered individuals put high expectations of superficiality on you?,"Okay, so, its been known now for awhile that I don't feel right in my body; I didn't exactly choose to come out but hey, I grew up in a small town, my family questioned me until it came out, and they needed to vent to someone so of course it spread like wildfire.
I used to get horrible dysphoria constantly, until I began to just accept that I was born how I was born; it doesn't have to affect how I feel inside. Now, people see me as just an obnoxious drag queen, all because I've become satisfied with just dressing feminine.
When I would put forth effort into my appearance, I would get people questioning my gender, and it made me feel good; but as I would be out and about, my five o'clock shadow would come in, and it wouldn't take long for some one (usually a cis-female, in my personal experience) to point out ""hey girly, you got a nice beard going there"" and my entire good mood would plummet.
Since then, I've put a lot of personal work into not caring what I appear as, as long as I know for certain how I feel inside.
Here's the thing; all the people that patted me on the back, told me how brave I was, told me they accept me and still love me, all of them now say I'm not really a girl; why? Because I'm not superficial? Must one be superficial to be a ""real"" woman? I know who I am, but it seems to me more and more the people that were so ready to be my friend are even more ready to turn their back on me as soon as I don't look good enough for them, or stop caring about image. I've put in my work, and faced my fears, yet I still get people who should know me better by now virtually crapping all over me and telling me I'm wrong to challenge the idea of what it means to be a women.
If I'm going to be totally blunt and honest ( and I imagine many readers at this point are going to tune out ) Many trans women seem to boil down the idea of ""female"" to a few basic concepts, and use that as the model for their life. I've always looked up to the women in my life as strong role-models, with many diverse personalities and characteristics. If you care about appearances and take care of yourself, kudos; you have your health together more than I do. You will also probably find a spouse and get married before me a well.
My goal isn't to be some man's plaything; I've been objectified multiple times and guess what? It doesn't feel good. (okay, it might for the quarter of an hour it lasts but afterward... eh.)


TL:DR
I guess what the issue boils down to is, because I want to be a woman, people expect me to only care about looking pretty and getting laid. I only want to think about science and music. I get the uncommon (yet shared with many of you, I'm sure) perspective of experiencing hatred from both cis-genders, and the expectations and assumptions they have of each other boggles my mind to no end.
Thank you for reading, I look forward to hearing any response or comments you have. I tried to be coherent but I'm tired and my mind is aching. Peace!"
RockerBoyGirl,asktransgender,Will my dysphoria return?,"So I'm pretty sure I HAD gender dysphoria at around the age of 14-15.

Thought about wanting to be in witness protection so I could hide out as a girl lol. Even thought about whether I'd be reincarnated as a girl. I never considered I could be Trans

Then however I stopped all this and pretty much forgot about it and the desire for a good 4/5 years until now at age 20.

It makes me feel uncomfortable looking in the mirror because of it and I try to limit looking at myself to just before I leave the house. I've also been depressed for a majority of the time since 7th grade(coincidentally when I first started having feelings I might be trans) and over the last two years when I really looked into what being transgender was, my depression has been constant and the worst its ever been. The reason I'm hesitant to say this is dysphoria and that I am trans is because although I'm certain I would feel 100% better in life if I was a girl, I only feel minor dysphoria when I think about acting like a guy. I hate acting like a guy and partaking in the things guys like to do but I've done it for so long that I think I could probably do it for the rest of my life if I had to. I don't know. I'm just trying to get a grasp on if I'm suffering from dysphoria and if I am trans. Thanks."

moriati18,asktransgender,"Question to transwomen: after transitioning, have you experienced sexism ""as cis women do"", and has this impacted your ideas around your gender?","Just wondering, after you transitioned, did you experience or notice traditional misogyny towards your new gender role as a woman, (i.e. being talked down to, or treated differently than you were as a man), and did this impact your ideas around gender?
I am just curious as a cis women who envies some of the physical and mental privileges that men are afforded in our world, and interested to hear transwomen's side of the story as to why they ""gave it up"" so to speak (not implying that being trans is voluntary or anything, just curious as to transwomen's thoughts on the matter. Also I fully respect people's right to do what they want with their bodies, and support people living as they please). "

dorkdarkness,asktransgender,Why does it matter to some of you?,"Hey there. I'm biologically female but I guess, for all intents and purposes, am non-binary. I've lurked and perused places like this thoroughly but I wanted to have a full discussion with you guys!

As a non-binary person, I feel disconnected to the importance of gendered pronouns. Heck, I know non-binary folks who NEED to be called ""they,"" and I don't understand them either. Let me have the floor for a moment.

Growing up, I flirted with the idea of being an FtM but realized I never felt like a boy, anyway. I just didn't feel like a girl. I haven't ever felt like anything, except when it was shoved in my face. 

""Girls need long hair! Girls can't play so roughly!""(negative)

""Doesn't she look like such a princess?"" (positive)

When I'm by myself, alone, I don't feel like anything unless it's something stereotypical and it makes me laugh, like watching a chick flick while painting my nails.

Without society, I just feel like a person with breasts and a vagina. Biologically female, and that's the end of that.

What is it that really makes you guys and girls feel like a man or a woman? 

I've always felt disconnected to my genitalia. It's just... there. The only time it feels ""wrong"" is when a man is eyeballing my breasts or my cramps are too strong that time of the month. In the first case, it's other peoples perceptions that make me feel uncomfortable. In the second... Well, who wants agonizing pain every month?

(I know some MTFs want a period, but I do bet you guys would be breaking out the tylenol at least!)

Why does proper pronoun usage elate you?

I get called a boy and a girl depending on clothing choices. I recognize it validates your attempts at being a woman or man, but I ask:

Why do you need validation? If you feel like a woman or a man, what does it matter what Billy the shop-keep believes you are? I understand it's a matter of respect when in close quarters with friends and family but there are folks who take Billy the shop-keep really seriously.

 I know biological females who identify as a woman who would be upset if they were called a man and this is because they want to be a feminine, attractive woman. Being called a man means they are not that. It's not because, ""oh gosh, I am actually a woman, and they called me sir!"" It's, ""Oh, gosh, they think I'm unattractive and masculine."" It's an aversion to masculinity itself because it is undesirable as a woman. 

My second question is - why conform to the standards of feminity and masculinity? It seems really backwards when people are claiming being transgender is breaking those standards when in reality, they are reinforcing them by saying, ""Long hair and a skirt means you're a woman, and short hair and baggy jeans means you're male."" I understand a lot of MtFs and FtMs cannot ""pass"" without following societal expectations of their preferred gender, but this isn't transcending standards of gender, it's giving in.

I just don't get it and, I guess I don't like it. I wish someone would be willing to in-depthly discuss certain things with me, so I've come here for the opportunity to have a dialogue about things I have real trouble grasping and have differing view points on."
_Earthrise_,asktransgender,"How did you survive being in the closet, and how did you make it out?","For context, I'm a 21 y/o pre-everything MTF. I found out I was trans this spring, and since then, I feel like my life has imploded despite the steps I've been taking towards transition. 

When I accepted that I had to transition, I did so with a very specific plan in mind. Aside from only a few people, I wanted to stay closeted, work on my wardrobe, work on makeup, start laser, and get on HRT so that in a year's time, I would be ready to just go full-time and never look back. I thought it would be fine, that I'd be able to handle it, that this was the best path for me. Now it seems like that's anything but true. 

Since accepting that I'm trans, my dysphoria feels like its gotten worse by the day. As much as I recognize some inherently feminine qualities of my body (genetically I'm pretty lucky), I can only see them as smothered in this vat of masculinity. My body hair and shape drive me crazy, and being out in the world while closeted has started to break me. Each day I'm out in public I get more depressed and anxious about the fact that I'm being percieved as male, and barely have any time to present as female privately anymore. I've started to drift away from my friends and my passions, avoiding any social interaction because I just don't want to be seen or treated like that. There's an alarm bell going off in my head where my body tells me ""we can't exist like this anymore."" I don't want to die, but each day I dread waking up more and more. This is very dramatic, but it's like if I'm not female then I don't want to be alive. 

For the past few months I've buried a lot of these feelings because I'm so scared to come out and transition and lose everything, but now I don't know how to continue living like this. Part of me is wishing that the longer I contain this, it'll just go away and I can feel normal again, but I know that isn't true. I keep telling myself ""just make it to June, just make it to June,"" but I'm not sure I can anymore. The plan I committed to originally doesn't seem to working out and I don't know what to do about it.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, where they spent an extended period of time in the closet after they knew, please talk to me. How did you survive this? What did you do to ""make it"" out? What was your experience with all this? Right now I feel so lost and scared. Every day hurts more and more, and I don't know how to make it stop. 

Sorry to be so down, but I'm really reeling right now and just need some advice. Thanks for reading, and please respond if you're so compelled."
the_stalking_leopard,asktransgender,Will an eating disorder stunt HRT results?,"I can't seem to wrap my head around this. I'm 16 MTF, and I'm staring HRT any day now (awaiting my doctor to call in the prescriptions). 

However one thing that I've struggled with since 6th grade was anorexia and bulimia, both coming and going separately and spurts. And usually once I get hooked, it lasts for months to a year.

And I'm hooked again.

This has been troubling me so much lately. I'm so dissatisfied with my appearance that I've begun under-eating and purging again. It's caused by my fear that I won't pass. However being a MtF is a tremendous weight on my shoulder that I feel a constant pressure to start HRT now and to eat healthy, and I'm seriously considering cancelling transitioning for it. 

In fact, it's been making me doubt my whole gender identity! I use to think that my EDs were gender dysphoria in disguise, but now I'm feeling it's the reverse and that I simply hate my male body because of my obsession with weight and food and calories and the such. But I use to starve myself to *avoid* masculinization brought on by puberty. It's somewhat worked, but now I'm afraid if I do it again, estro won't have much an affect on me.

Will it stunt breast growth and hip growth?

And please do not tell me to work this out with a therapist. That isn't my question and that isn't helpful and will in fact stress me more from past experiences I rather not discuss.

And don't lie to me please. I could end up doing my old diet regime again if it won't solidify the effects of HRT. Sometimes it gets to be too much that I don't really have a choice. But if it really is that significant of an effect, it may be enough to get me through."
nibattack,asktransgender,How to handle constantly being misgendered?(long/advice),"Okay so I'm a fresh little 20 year old and i've known i'm not a girl since I was 15. I'm pre-everything. Out to most but not to all including not being out to my mom. (I told her I was bi when I was 16 and based on how bad that went I just don't think i'd have a mom anymore if I told her i was trans lol) I'm pretty feminine and pre everything though not by choice but I am. So how do you handle getting misgendered constantly or at all? It brings on so much dysphoria and depression for me honestly. Like every time my mom greets me with ""hello baby girl"" i feel like im dying and it feels like shes saying it just because she wants to hurt me even though thats not true. Or theres the case of intentional misgendering to make you feel bad. I'm out to my boyfriends mom and she intentionally refers to me as a girl or an ""it"" whenever possible because of a fight we got into like last year. Or online? LIke my battlenet name is Transgender (I already changed it once and cant change it again without buying all my games again) and constantly online i get called an it/tr*nny/d*ke/ext and jus tlike??? It makes me so sad, anxious, scared for my safety. I already have bipolar disorder and PTSD so managing my anxiety and depression is difficult on most days but getting misgendered usually makes it 10xs worse. 

So how do you deal with intentional/not intentional misgendering?

GabiCap,asktransgender,Therapist explained biological causes so I don't think I'm trans,"Had a therapy session today. Talked a lot about how I'm very black and white and strict with myself.

But anyways, part of the conversation came back to gender and so my therapist asked if I have done any research into the biological causes of transgenderism. I said no and she went into development in the womb that causes a disconnect and kids recognize this really early on.

Well, I don't feel like a ""girl inside a guy's body"" but do feel so wonderful and free as Gabi.... but doesn't every guy think being a girl could be better?

While I don't feel ""trapped in the wrong body"" I did go into my childhood. I played house, played Cinderella, wanted to be called pretty... ALL were shut down by my parents extremely quickly and had gender roles ingrained in me strongly when young.  (And at 13 when I realized I might be gay I thought, ""Yay! Can I wear a wedding dress and being the girl in the relationship?"")

Anyways, all this has me thinking, I don't think anything happened in the womb since I look at myself and don't feel like a girl or particularly girly (though wish i were feminine). So part of me is thinking just put away my girl clothes and say oh well.

(kinda weird that I'm slightly disappointed, kinda wished I was)"
In_the_fad3,asktransgender,[NSFW] Sexual orientation,"I'm quite sure that I'm not the only one that after coming out to themselves as trans to face a lot of questions and curiosities but I'm just curious as to how many fellow MtF's who were originally attracted to women have experienced a sort of change in sexual interests? 

I should state I'm pre HRT but discovering my true self has slightly opened some of those repressed feelings everyone is so familiar with. Such as I have never been attracted to males, but recently I've decided to try out many different things to see if this identity is true. And most all have given me a clairvoyance to my femininity. So I gave being with a man a shot (was very feminine the entire night leading up going to his place). I was very anxious but stuck to the plan and jeez, am I grateful for that. I've always been a very dominate type of person, not really in bed though as I've always been indifferent about sex due to dysphoria of my body, but giving up that control and being submissive was like a lightbulb lit up illuminating that a large **** attached to a buff stud would be such a jubilant experience. I'm just very excited after reading many threads of transitioning women's experience with gaining interest in men where the previously had none after starting hormones, which when I start them would most likely only increase my attraction. Mainly because I wouldn't mind the whole cliche of finally being a woman and having my own man. With that said though, I still find the majority of men repulsing but I also have sort of high standards for relationships but, I would lie if I said that a well hung man is not a god send ;) 

Can anyone else relate to the submissive realization?"

ThrowawayTrans15,asktransgender,I believe in Erotic Target Location Error (ETLE),"Disclaimer:

1) I understand the topic is controversial, not my intention to offend

2) I don't agree w/ AGP typology and classifications and DONT think ETLE is what causes transness/dysphoria.

3) If you disagree w/ me please let me know why


There are a few reasons why I think ETLE is real and why Blanchard &amp; co where right on (this part only). I believe this because I seem to fit the description to a T and makes the most sense to me. I don't seem to have an orientation, the ONLY thing that turns me on is imagining I have a female body in my fantasies and (me as female) is the focus of these fantasies. The fantasies seem to be what most typical straight guys' would be like except for one major difference, the focus is not on another girl but inverted on myself as the girl. One criticism of ETLE is that women also fantasize about being women in their fantasies. The difference however are women in the fantasies because that's who they are and the focus is on their partner unlike those w/ ETLE. Again, due to my lack of an orientation and the focus of my fantasies I believe the theory of ETLE is real and describes me. 

Do you agree? If not why?"

Anyone start taking wellbutrin and taken blood tests that showed an increase in T? Or noticed that they started to masculinize. The clinic I go to doesnt do blood tests so I have to go to my private doctor or a private lab for that.

Since I came out both to myself and others, my dysphoria got somehow stronger. For example, my genital dysphoria was never an issue when I was by myself, my genitals only bothered me when I was with other people. But now when I feel the urge to masturbate (because, you know, hormones and stuff) I find it really hard.

lostwithnomap,asktransgender,I know this question gets asked all the time...,"But I don't know if I'm trans or not, or at least not cis male.

I'm AMAB (just learning all this terminology in the past couple weeks). 

I don't know if I am really feeling what I'm feeling, or if something really shameful is fucking with me. I am in an open relationship with my main partner (F) and I've been seeing this other girl, we'll call her Jess. We had a physical relationship for a short time (because I'm so shy and had to work up to it) until she recently became monogamous with a transgirl (we'll call her Ava). 

I really want to support Jess because with her past, she really needs a strong, stable lesbian relationship. And I care about her a lot. Her new partner is really cool and is the first trans-individual I've ever met in person (knowingly, of course).

Basically I've been pining over Jess while at the same time developing or realizing, maybe, feelings like I might be...something else. I don't know. And I'm terrified that these feelings are something I'm faking because I want to be closer or more like Ava so I can be closer to Jess in some fucked up way. Or is meeting a trans individual showing me something? She is incredibly confident in herself and, like, it's working. It works.

I've always been very submissive sexually. All of my fantasies involve being the submissive in a relationship, in which I'm small, weak, and usually an androgynous boy or a girl. I never imagine myself as the man in regular porn, always the girl. I absolutely love and desire male anatomy sexually but I have no attraction at all to men themselves, so I don't consider myself gay. My ideal partner is a female with a penis. 

I love wearing thigh-highs or lingerie or stockings, but I don't like the way my body looks in them. I would feel sexier if the difference between my body and the things I like to wear wasn't so stark. I enjoy, at least to myself, standing and walking in a feminine way, usually just when I'm home by myself, but it isn't 24/7.

I don't get a lot of enjoyment out of normal hetero sex, PIV. I have been on anti-depressants for about a year now and there are sexual side-effects that I believe make it harder for me to orgasm, and I'm switching to a different medication now. So maybe that's why, but still, none of my fantasies involve my putting my penis in anybody else and that isn't new.

At least since 5th grade I've been experimenting with anal play and my taste in porn just got more...extreme, I guess? It isn't insane or anything but I'm not really turned on by normal porn anymore unless, again, I imagine myself as the woman or receptive partner. I know I would love to live in a woman's body for a day, I think I would do it for an entire year or more but it would depend on my life circumstances. So I'm also scared that this is just a fetish, wanting to be a girl or take the role of the receptive partner, because it really is sexually important for me.

But I don't feel any sort of major dysphoria, I don't hate my genitals, or my body hair really, and I have a decent beard that is kind of a part of me now. It's almost like my protection, in the same way I cover all of my skin when I go out, I just feel less vulnerable. 

I have been snooping these boards, the /r/genderqueer boards, and others pretty intensely for the past couple weeks. Maybe this in itself means something, I don't know. Or I really am just disgustingly trying to be more like Ava in a really fucked up way because that's who Jess, in a way, left me for, even though we are still incredibly close friends and help each other with our respective relationships.

Sorry for the giant post. Maybe I'm just crazy because I'm switching medications. Who fucking knows. Thanks to anybody who made it this far, hope you all are doing well out there."
shaylee10028,asktransgender,My nephew (niece?) has an issue and I don't know where to start.,"My sister's son had to stay in the hospital for awhile after his birth. I was out of the country at the time so I wasn't sure what happened, I just thought he was premature or something along the lines. I don't talk to my sister much.

My nephew came over to stay the night last weekend and he confessed to me that he doesn't want to be a boy. He is 10 years old so I couldn't really know if he was serious or not.

When it was time for him to leave, he begged me to keep him because his mom said she would hit him if he ""became a girl"", and he didn't want to live as a boy. And he burst into tears.

I called my sister and asked if he could stay some extra time yaddah yaddah and I did some research about transgender children and found that he could get on blockers to delay puberty to get decisions. I asked my sister about it and she screamed and yelled at me.

Fast forward to today, my brother-in-law (sister's husband) called me and told me that my nephew was born intersex and that the doctors had removed a clit and partially-formed labia, and that they mean to have him on testosterone treatments, and that he is simply faking it because he doesn't want shots.

I'm sorry if that doesn't fit the definition of transgender, I'm just really confused and need help. My nephew clearly doesn't want to be a boy yet they mean to force him to be one, and that he had genital surgery without consent and was assigned male when he could have been female (could he have?).

As his aunt, is there anything I can do to put him on hormone blockers? Or what can I say to his parents to convince them otherwise?"
mostbricks,asktransgender,NSFW Did any of you start questioning around the same time you started sexually exploring your body?,"Hi, just curious. I'm a 22 year old AMAB currently trying to figure out what's going on with me. Thinking back, I noticed that I only started to become aware of my dysphoria about 3 years ago, some time after masturbating for the first time. Yeah, I was like 19 when I started fapping. Handling my penis has always caused me some amount of anxiety or discomfort, especially when I was a little kid. In retrospect that's some kind of sign right?

Regardless, I've always assumed I was perfectly cis, save for the occasional desire to experience being a girl, and things got better over time. Some time after I started masturbating regularly, however, I suddenly started having issues with my gender identity. I don't think I need to go into much detail with that, it's pretty standard stuff I'm experiencing. So yeah, title. I just want to get an idea of how weird this is."

NatFox,asktransgender,Critical Identity Crisis Need Advice. (Sorry it's lengthy),"* Okay so at first I think this heading could be better but it's what I'm going through with my gender and my personality. I can't afford therapy , am barely able to afford college and I need some help from those who have been through it so where better than Reddit. I also apologize I'm awful at talking and wording. Good thing I'm not an english major haha. 
So, I have um well three names so just call me Nat or Fox or NatFox I guess. Whatever . So, I have an issue with my gender. And I also have a personality issue. I've always had it since I was about 7 as far as i can consciously remember. My depression from age 9 got worse and I had bad dysphoria. Piercing my body made me happy and feel more confident. As I realize I'm about to move to a new place and start a completely new slate I need to know who I am.
 
*  I've always felt wrong as a girl . I didn't like my body (especially once puberty hit) or the cloths I had to wear and even after being able to change my cloths I wasn't completely happy.  I wanted to be like the guys I saw on TV and around me, not just be with them( but that too on occasion). I realized I was into women which isn't accepted either by my family or where I lived. Eventually i felt the urge to and I cut my hair, still not happy with myself but felt better with a typical guy's haircut. I felt extremely uncomfortable during middle school and through a divorce and through high school to this point when being expected to be a female. I didn't like the terms she or lady like ect. I didn't know what to do with myself and none of my therapists thought it was an actual problem to help me with. 

*  I also had a second part to me it was like a switch that randomly went off. I felt more confident cross dressed I was happier I felt connected to myself without the attributes of a woman but it wasn't my normal mind set. But I was still depressed and had my mental issues. And I also didn't feel complete cause I couldn't pass. My voice being one of the reasons and I've always hated it.   I don't remember everything I do when I'm like that and I can't force it to happen( except it occurs when I'm cross dressing).

*  BUT there was a point in high school I also noticed I have a super sub and feminine mind set that also seemed to have a switch  enjoys being SUPER girly and she's kind of merged with who I am as a girl at this point except when I feel like her I don't feel detached from myself or disgusted with myself. I didn't realize this until again things were brought up that i had no recollection of.

* So I have the issue that I don't know which ones me cause Me is 2 different people and a middle ground I don't like. I'm scared of making the wrong choice of who I am. I always felt I should be a guy and this alternate mind set occurred and I'm happy as him but worried I won't pass as a male because I'm submissive and other reasons,or that I won't like who I am after transition. But then there's the other personality that tells me to stay a girl and be a princess and be happy as what I am because there's no way I'm that guy but it still doesnt feel 100% right either. And I'm the middle ground, I can't fully control who comes out or when although I'm finding ways as I go and I just want to know who and what I am it's so frustrating to where sometimes I just cant get up or look at myself.

invadergrimm,asktransgender,"North Carolina residents...how are you dealing with the notorious ""bathroom bill"" (HB2)? Specifically if you are NB or GQ or not quite all the way transitioned...","I'm at a point in my transition where I don't feel comfortable using either gendered restroom in public.

On top of that, I have a young daughter who I must accompany to the restroom in public.

How do you deal?"
wallkin,asktransgender,I don't want to have sex with anyone?,"I'm one of those that didn't discover my trans identity until after age 20. I mean, I knew something was up. I would drunkenly admit to ""sometimes thinking I'm a girl, but I'm not trans or anything lol."" In any case, I'm now on hrt and so so so happy. But while my libido is only somewhat reduced (it's about 50% what it was pre-hrt), my sexuality seems completely different. I just can't seem to be attracted to anyone anymore. I go the entire day talking to dozens of different people, and I have no desire to think of anyone sexually. I used to fantasize about women constantly. I'm pretty sure that part of my attraction to females previously had to do with wanting to ""claim"" their femininity as my own. I don't know. I don't have any inclination to seek a sexual or romantic parter, partially because I'm so early in transition and very insecure about my body. I've never experimented or been close to experimenting with guys.

Iyelexi,asktransgender,"Started HRT at IC place, but moving to or near Kansas City, will gatekeeping be a concern?","Long story short, moving either to or close to there, because truth be told, I'm poor, and frankly housing in the West and East coasts in the United States is a LOT HARDER to afford for poor people, that's the non-TLDR version. One of the first things I did was google HRT transgender Kansas City, and I found some horror stories of gatekeeping with HRT that frightened me.

I currently live on the west coast, and I already have to literally travel to another city whenever I see my doctor, so I suppose I might be able to get by having to travel one or two cities to get to where I need to be.

Seems like the difficulties with that, are rooted in the fact that while bigger cities tend to be more socially progressive, and more likely to have IC clinics, that bigger cities are ALSO much more difficult to afford housing in if you don't have a lot of money.

On the (upside?) I am already on HRT (fortunately my insurance covers it), have been since the 13th, and my therapist has strongly advised me after I move, to have my current doctor that overlooks my HRT to get into contact with whoever my future doctor is.

Will this make me a lot safer from gatekeeping? Should I be presenting extra-traditionally-feminine just to be on the safe side?

Do keep in mind, I care more about HRT than everything. It is my lifeline, and I'd much much rather lose my freedom of self expression, and not risk my HRT, then get all gutsy risking my own well being to make some transgender political statement. 

I've also seen enough horror stories about trans women being forced to wear dresses or skirts for HRT, that I'm starting to seriously consider a more traditionally feminine presentation. Do my fears sound justified, or am I in the all clear since I'm already on HRT and all that?"
transsurgery,asktransgender,Can estrogen increase post op vag sensitivity?,"I had surgery 2 months ago and finally got back onto estrogen a few days ago (I had to see a gynecologist because I get the implant).

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,I am really conflicted about surgeries.,"So I am pretty sure I want to have full SRS/GRS one day. I just don't have the money to do it any time soon, and I need to get FFS first. So who knows when that will happen. I do however have funds for an orchie as insurance should partially or fully cover it. 

The thing I am conflicted about is that, I might be fine with just an orchie, because only my balls give me dysphoria. Hopefully i can get a partner who is fine with that too. But I don't think I am strong enough to be a person with a penis and no balls. I don't think there is anything wrong with it, but I feel like I would be incomplete somehow. Like it neither full male or full female. But the thing is the more I think about getting an orchie, the more it seems like it is the smartest option. Because It alleviates one of my biggest dysphoria inducers, it's affordable, and I can still have SRS/GRS in the future. 

The other hangup I have about getting just an orchie is that I am so afraid of getting arrested. I am a very dark skinned POC. and I hear that even if you have your name and gender legally changed (I am in the United States), if you have a penis they will put you in the mens prison. I am so scared of that. Is this true?

I am mtf, but I apreciate any perspectives. "
potatochocolate,asktransgender,Losing male friends and struggling to find female friends?,"I'm a 20 year old MtF about to begin HRT. One major concern about transition for me is friends. I've had the same group of guy friends since I was a kid. Since high school I still hang out with 5 of them, and I'm close with 2. We've always been gaming nerds, and due to social anxiety I've largely stuck with this group of friends. The problem is, I know that most of them are fairly homophobic and transphobic. I'm expecting to lose a few of them when I come out.

I don't have any female friends, and have never really been close with a girl before. I'm afraid of losing my male friends and struggling to find female friends. :( Since I've grown up spending all my time either reading books, watching shows, studying or gaming (introvert life), I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin to make friends with girls. Even if I managed to become ""one of the girls"", I'd probably feel out of place being a lifetime behind them in terms of being a girl. I feel like I'd also be self conscious about being the ""odd one out"" as the only trans girl when they're all cis. Or am I just over thinking all of this?

I'm so close to beginning HRT, so all these last minute doubts are creeping up on me. &gt;.&lt;"

It's been almost 13 months since ffs and I'm sure plenty of you know that I'm not really happy with the results (mostly with chin and jaw). 
I feel that in the early stages of my post-op, I looked a lot more feminine and that could because of swelling.
I'm going to post a small album you can compare how I went through healing over the last year. A current one can be given upon request. Album is right here http://imgur.com/a/5EEgw

Now after looking over these pics, I feel that I remasculized and it sucks. If you noticed the 3rd pic, my left cheek is horribly sunken in (right is the same way), giving my face a very gaunt appearance. Now I messaged the surgeon and told him about this with pictures and he said it looks fine, but from these pics, they clearly aren't.

So I like to ask you girls, if you experienced what I've been going through? My therapist says it's BDD, but it clearly isn't as I've had a few doctors ask about my sunken cheeks.

LightningZombie,asktransgender,Disability and Gender Dysphoria,"So, I am currently living with a roommate that attacked me for being trans. Well I am living off of SSI, HRT, and have tons of social services that well aren't helping me much. 

More context, I live in California, My girlfriend lives in Vegas and wants me to move there for safety reasons. I am diagnosed with autism and gender dysphoria. Whenever I move even just to another city SSI has stopped giving me money for months on end. I am very concerned I could loose my services and SSI from moving. The Central Valley Regional Center is not only my gateway to social services it is also my payee. Anyways does anyone have any info and sources I could give her to help move me if it is even safe or possible? I cannot live on nothing or without HRT. 

On a side note I am also currently trying to change my name/gender marker here and I have no idea if that could ruin my resources either info on that would also be appreciated."
OutTransThrowaway,asktransgender,Reactions to coming out as MtF transgender: Do they vary based on your current physical features?,"I hypothesize that if you're more masculine looking, reactions are akin to ""It's a shame he wants to be a woman, he's such a handsome man"" or ""Honestly I don't think he will be able to pass""

And then on the other hand, if you're more feminine-looking, reactions are more likely to be supportive, especially if you look better as a woman. Like ""Oh he's so short, he looks better as a woman""

The reason I say this is because due to my feminine physical features, I look much better during/after transition, and people know it. Used to be quite hideous looking with short hair, I'm not able to look like a handsome respectable man. I'm about 5' 7"" and 115 lbs, which falls into the upper half of pathetic ""manlet"" range, and the only compliments on appearance I've ever gotten are on feminine traits that girls say they wish they had.

And so I don't mean to brag, but bigots are probably more likely to accept a transgender person who looks better after transition, as opposed to the image they have of a tall broad-shouldered crossdresser with a beard shadow. "

He also said that he didn't have any ""immediate plans"" to go and do this however, but he did ask me what I thought if he decided  to cross-dress one day. He told me that he might not actually want to do this and it could just be some yearning for attention but this was the situation nonetheless. It caught me completely off guard because he had never given any indication that he felt this way. In the moment, I tried to be supportive and tell him that that's a personal decision he should make on his own as to ensure  whatever he decides, that he's comfortable and happy. But honestly, I don't know if I would be comfortable being in a relationship if this were the case. I completely respect people and their individual sexuality and I completely respect him, I'm just not attracted to people who are transgender. He did say that he didn't have any ""plans"" to go and wear woman's clothes but if one day he did, I wouldn't be comfortable with it. I don't know what to do or what to say to him. I don't know if I should feel guilty for feeling this way because there is something from this situation that I'm missing. I realize that he just confided this huge thought to me and I really don't want to throw it back at him but I also want to respect him and tell him how I feel. "

serenagirl1993,asktransgender,What do you guys do to push forward?,"I feel as if I'm in a really rough patch right now. There's nothing more that I want to do than make a stable income and relocate from my home state of North Carolina altogether. 

I've been trying to begin hormone replacement therapy since March of this year to no avail. The first time, I had just come back to NC after working with a program called FEMACorps after my granddad died and was struggling to find employment. So, I created a GoFundMe to raise funds that would help pay for blood work at my local Planned Parenthood (where I could begin HRT via informed consent). I successfully raised an affordable amount but when push came to shove, my appointment ended up being cancelled because Kate Scanlan was out of office. A series of unfortunate events caused me to further delay rescheduling. By the time I would have been able to, I didn't have the funds anymore. 

In July I finally was able to switch my health insurance from what I had been receiving in this FEMACorps program. I thought I had researched carefully for a plan that could cover HRT. I chose United Healthcare, however I don't believe I was careful as I should have been. The United Healthcare plan I chose specifically didn't cover HRT. 

I've tried working odd jobs to try to save up for HRT in addition to money for moving out, but my anxiety and dysphoria has projected to a crippling point where I can barely function in public. 

Finally, at the beginning of this month I decided to utilize my skills at writing to start my own freelance writing business. It's early so I haven't landed any clients or success yet, and I'm just beginning to feel really down. 

Just all the trial and error I've had to deal with this year and with the passing of my grandfather who raised me like his own child. And just feeling stuck in my family home and wanting to move out. I'm just mind numbingly exhausted. I've picked up drinking wine almost every single day, and in the brink of all this, I'm trying to quit my smoking habit which just feels like it's increasing my stress.

I've been on hormones for three months now, and lately I've caught myself saying things like ""god lol I'm so stupid"" or ""haha wth I could've figured that out"" etc.
Thing is, most of the time I've thought this I've genuinely thought I was being, like, stupid. And when I was, well, ""male presenting"", I did not have these thoughts neither did I consider myself less gifted.

So my question is, does this possibly have anything to do with my brain on estrogen? Or is it my internalized misogyny making me just acting more dumb because, well, I can? I feel like I've been way more kind of careless since presenting female as well, like ""oh well who cares if I don't know that lol"". It's so hard to describe really but I guess this is the best way I can. I thought I'd ask you all, sorry if this offends anyone or is inconsiderate. It's just such a tangible change from how I used to be, that's all.

Probably societal, right? Or?

Lessthanjake03,asktransgender,Question about a schools role,"I hope this is an appropriate sub for this.
I'll try and make this as short as I can. 
Just a little background...have a really awesome 6 year old son who has always been into 'girly' shows, toys, games etc...
No big deal.
He has recently expressed that he likes dresses, wants to have long hair etc...He told me one night that when he grows up he wants to wear dresses and glue a wig to his head and be a girl. I can live with all of this. I'm a very accepting person. 

Today at in class his teacher said something like 'all the boys go do X and all the girls go do Y' and my son sat at his desk. When the teacher asked him what was going on he said he did not want to be labeled as a boy or a girl. 
The guidance counselor pulled him out of class and started asking him questions. At this point I'm a little annoyed because I was not called or asked about anything (I'm also not a big fan of him missing learning time) 
My concern is the school 'pushing' him one way or another. I don't want them telling him he IS a boy or going to the other end and telling him he IS a girl...if that makes sense. What role if any should the school be playing at this point? 
I feel like I should be have been consulted about this process before they pulled him from class. 
I was never called. I was told about this by my child and called the school. We are going to talk more Monday. 

I don't know what is to young to be making these choices or if feelings change as children age etc...
Any insight anyone can give me would be appreciated. I now every situation is different I'm just looking for people that have 'been there before me' or are transgender themselves. 
Bottom line is I love my child and will support him no matter what. I just don't want other people pushing him.  It also really hurts me how horrible some people are to the transgender community and makes me scared for my son if he indeed feels that he is trans.

I'm tired of fighting on social media and other sites with a bunch of twits who don't know anything about me and automatically decide I must have XYZ things because I'm a trans woman. Who tell me I'm a man and who only serve to remind me how lonely I truly feel.

I'm sick of the in-fighting. I'm sick of myself sometimes. I don't want to be alone on reddit, but I'm tired of the negativity and comments I get my way because people want to be assholes because of my transness.

So I guess the best thing to do is re-make, start anew, and keep quiet. I won't post my face for awhile (since my visage is apparently trickery to straight men) and I'll avoid posting to trans subs.

Lately dysphoria has hit me SO HARD and I became obsessed with passing. I've never tucked, I usually just wore baggy clothes but now I'm running out of clothes and I just wanna learn to do this thing.

Problem is, I'm squeamish AF. I tried to tuck before and I actually managed (I dont even know how) to push one of my testes up, and I felt some kind of ""pop"" that really freaked me out so now I'm kinda ""blocked"" and I don't know what to do.

Any advice? Do you know if it's dangerous? P.S. I have a varicocele on my left teste. "

its_harvey,asktransgender,Came Out and the situation is worse than I ever thought it would be,"So, I've posted recently here about my coming out experience. Sorry for basically clogging up this subreddit with my many threads but I'm really desperate and have nowhere else to go. 

I mentioned in previous posts that I came out to my dad two days ago. Saying he didn't take it well is a bit of an understatement. Right before a psych exam yesterday he sent me a text saying we needed to talk and so I called him. He said a lot of things, like I had no idea how he felt and how this was affecting him and how he felt worse now than the day his dad died, but that's not even the worst of it. 

Last night we had a three hour conversation where he told me a lot of things, but most of what stood out to me was him telling me that I had no idea what it took to be a man, that I could never be a man and that I wasn't built for it. He also told me that I would always be a woman no matter what I did, because God put me on this earth as a woman for a reason and nothing would change that. He asked me what it was that I hated about
myself like I hadn't just told him I was transgender, and told me than transitioning wasn't fixing the problem but running away from it and letting satan into my heart. He told me that this culture was """"taboo"""" and that he could not condone it, or be around it and I can't make him. I have a history of gaslighting and emotional manipulation with my parents, but this is worst than any of that. 

Lots of other things where said, he believes I'm brainwashed too, but now I'm at a standstill. I don't want to be in this house anymore living this lie and pretending for even another year that it's okay. I didn't take back what I said, but I can't stay here. I came out because I was fed up with not being able to transition, and even said that I would if I had their support or if I didn't. 

I have a friend who lives several states away, but I only have 300$ to my name and would essentially be homeless. She's out as lesbian to her parents and I know they would 100% accept me as trans, but I don't have enough money to move out yet. I'm 18, and I don't have a job, though I am searching for one. I'm sure that at least a few of you can understand why I can't stay here anymore even if I wasn't technically kicked out. I don't have anywhere to go in the meantime though, and I'm stuck here until I raise enough money. 

I'm just kind of going through the motions, and any, any help at all would mean the world to me. "
loango,asktransgender,Am I the only one who is just a complete failure at life?,"I'm not really sure what how I'm going to transition and live a normal life because I just haven't ever experienced that at all. I don't know how I'm going to manage to get out of the funk I'm in, and I have no idea if it has anything to do with being transgender or not.

I'm 29 years of age, and have never been romantic with anyone or sexually involved. Have almost one friend who I despise being with because I feel like I have to be a man around him. Have no job and have only ever had one job that was pretty much out of pity and doing tea and coffee making.

I'm going on hormones soon (hopefully!) but I can't see how I'm going to turn this ship around. Was anyone else a  complete failure before transition and managed to turn it around? Or am I just fucked?"
DXLecter,asktransgender,Am I overreacting?,"My mom has a friend that is transphobic, homophobic, and Islamophobic (I am Muslim; I converted 7 years ago). I know this woman (we used to be friends, sorta, also), and her and I have had debates about all three topics. I refuse to talk to her any more and my mom just tries to make excuses for her, like, ""Well, you have to understand where she is coming from; she doesn't know any better..."" Which, I call bs, because I have talked to this woman, and tried to explain to her why her views are incorrect (for example, the difference between transgender and sexuality, and why the bathroom bills do not protect people but rather put trans people in danger, etc). I have tried to do this in a civil manner, and she refuses to listen, and willfully remains ignorant. 

Last week I talked to my regular therapist about the issue and explained that part of the reason I am hesitant to come out to my mom as trans is because she maintains a friendship with a woman who, basically would see me as ""less than"" simply because of who I am. Tbf, I don't think my mom would disown me or anything; she would be supportive...but I feel her friendship with this woman, is hurtful to me...because, it's like saying ""no, go ahead and be prejudice toward people that are different than you, even if it's my child, it's okay."" Ugh. 

Anyhow, my therapist thinks I am overreacting and that by shutting people, like my mom's friend, out of my life, I am just going to end up being angry all the time and being lonely because I am not willing to accept people that may have different views than I do. She tried to give an example that she (my therapist) has friends that think mental health is made up, and they just have agreed to disagree on the issue. Um, I am sorry, that is not the same thing (and personally, if I had friends that thought like that, I probably would not talk to them either, tbh). "

I pass pretty well as far as I know with or without the extra curves, though I'm sure I'm more convincing visually with them. On the other hand, not having them makes me more relaxed, feel more natural - and I know that's as if not more important.

Like seal the records. And if someone were to see my BC at the town hall all they would see is my correct name and gender.

So I'm at about 7 months on HRT, and to be blunt about it, I'm just hornier again now than I was for a while. It's not intrusive or unpleasant, really, and it's easier to reach orgasm, so if this is just the new state of things, yay. 

It may just be that I've gotten more attuned to how my body responds and what arousal feels like now (which is awesome - more of the best parts of it and less of the stuff I didn't like, compared to before), and honestly, what feels nice, physically and mentally. 

But I'm also concerned it may indicate some kind of shift in my levels.

So I'm wondering if anyone else experienced a change in libido like this, and if it's a strong indication of anything I should be concerned about.

Ianach,asktransgender,Breast pain / development,"I know this topic has probably been here a billion times before, so sorry for making it again ^^ 

I started on HRT about 7 months ago, however due to certain peer issues I stopped about 3 / 4 months into it. When I stopped I had been having breast pain / some small development before stopping and I have started on HRT again a few days ago.

So the questions are these. If I had a small amount of breast development from HRT and then stopped for 3 months, would it remain there? 

Does me starting HRT again now start me off from where I was again in terms of development? I have noticed the same pains already, and by pains I mean the dull aching feeling. "
alessathecactus,asktransgender,Having *significant* hair loss three months into HRT (E + Spiro). My hair was amazing before and no loss. Halp.,"I'm taking intramuscular estradiol valerate and spironolactone. Before I started HRT I had gorgeous full hair, thick and strong. Within a week or two of starting up, I noticed my hair shedding. I understood this was normal as the hormones and anti-androgen encourage new hair growth so I let it slide even though it was upsetting. 

It's been approximately three months now. The shedding never stopped and my hair has gotten thinner and thinner, and it is so breakage-prone now that I am afraid to brush my hair. Yesterday I put my hair in a ponytail and when I undid it a clump of hair came out with the hair tie. 

My hair loss is worst on the sides and at my temples - if I part my hair at my temple you can see about a half-inch of scalp where before you could not see skin at all. It looks alarming, and is only getting worse. I have hair loss to a lesser degree on the top and in front at my hairline. On the hairs that fall out by the roots, the root is almost nonexistent. Tiny and white, barely visible. 

I've been trying vitamin supplements, increasing protein ... for about a month I've been washing my hair only every few days (more like every five now that I have discovered cornstarch and dry shampoos), using an argan oil blend, cutting out hair products. I dont brush my hair when it's wet, I barely towel it dry anymore. I used a crimper like once a week in my first month of hormones but stopped using heat altogether because the shedding and breakage were making me nervous. I can't mess with my hair now without having to practically lint-roll myself off.

My hair was NEVER like this before the hormones. My grandpa on my mom's side has male-pattern baldness  but on my dad's side going bald is unheard of ... the men dont even get gray hair. 

I'm going to my primary care doctor tomorrow, a dermatologist in two weeks, and my endocrinologist on Halloween. So I'm going to be getting a wealth of medical advice on this ... I'm just scared and want to know if anybody's been in a similar situation and can reassure me, or has advice on what things I should bring up to my trans-unaware doctor and dermatologist (besides that I'm on hormone therapy of course). Doctors around here need a lot of hand holding if you're trans ... :/

It's gotten to the point where I'm buying hats and bandanas because at this rate I'm going to need to shave my head and own this ... or walk around with patchy raggedy witch hair which I won't do. Somebody help me take the sting outta this, please."
NorthKoreasFinest,asktransgender,"Hey, never visited here before but maybe you guys can help me out with some perspective.","sorry for text wall

so I recently started a job on my college campus at a call center where we ask past graduates and parents if they'd like to donate back to their school.

every day before we start calls we go around the room and answer a question of the day. something usually like ""favorite Disney movie?"" or ""favorite chip brand?"" or something like that. When people stand up they also say their class (freshman, sophomore etc.) field of study, and their pronouns. 

now it's not that big a deal to me but I stopped and thought that since it's the same people who are scheduled to work for each day of the week, I and everyone in the room (by this point) has already heard everyone else's preferred pronouns, I thought, ""why are we still doing this?"" 

well instead of just saying that, I decided that I'd say something outrageous in order to point out the redundancy. so I said I identify as an EasyBake oven and my preferred pronouns are Convect, broil, and slow roast. 

in my head I thought it was pretty funny and I stand by that. however I didn't get the laugh (or at least chuckle) I thought I would. in fact one kid said out loud that ""that's not cool."" Not wanting to sit down and wallow in pure awkwardness/shame I doubled down and said that, that is actually how I identify and not to judge others by their preferences. needless to say it was pretty uncomfortable but I pressed forward with the day and didn't think a whole lot about it.

now let me explain why I said what I said. 

&gt;1. my thought process was that since we've all said the same thing each time we meet for a few days now, why go through  the motions over and over again and reiterate how we identify? (no one in the room is transgender) so in saying something that actually differs from everyone else's matching genders and identities I felt that I'd highlight why the practice is kind of pointless. you'd forget that people even said it if they all girls identify as girls and vice versa. but if someone actually was transgender, you'd know. since no one is = waste of time?

&gt;2. even if someone was transgender, why not just have them say whether they are or not as opposed to everyone else doing it as well?

well as I'm sure you can imagine, after work had finished other students who had taken what I said to heart talked to me about why I was wrong/why what I said was offensive. I meant no offense but just wanted to point out why I thought it was pointless to keep stating our gender identities at the start of each day. 

their response was that we say our genders in order to make transgender people feel more comfortable when stating their own gender identities (even though there are no trans people present) in order to subvert the culture of assuming a persons gender based on how they look.
that makes sense to me, I just don't see why if none of us are transgender, why go through with the practice and also, if someone was transgender I feel like if I addressed a MtF as ""him"" he could just correct me, I'd say ""oh okay my bad"" and continue the conversation. 


Hope that made sense.

TL;DR tried cracking a joke. fell flat. am I wrong in thinking that stating ones gender in a room full of cis gendered people over and over again is pointless if the whole point is to do it for transgender people who aren't even there?

It's really hard to know where to begin with this so I apologize if my post is lacking in direction and bounces from different things incoherently.

So, to preface this, I'm a 27 year old male-to-female who has been on hormone therapy (Spironolactone and Estradiol) for about two years now. I've had dysphoria related to my gender most of my life and had kept it hidden for a very long time. Throughout my late teenager years and early 20s I came very close to coming out, but buried those thoughts while convincing myself it wasn't real. Coming out finally at 25 and eventually starting to transition was one of the best decisions I had ever made, or so I thought. There's just a few things that bother me significantly enough to make me wonder if I've made the best decision of my life, or if I've made the worst mistake.

Basically, I'm starting to get seriously concerned with permanent effects to my genitals. I'm not okay with the shrinkage, and I'm not okay with the infertility, and I'm really hoping I'm not past the point of no return. When I was at the informed consent clinic filling out the paper work I really thought these things wouldn't bother me as much as it has started to. It's not like I hadn't done excessive research into these things beforehand, so when it came time to sign the paperwork I had already came to terms with what the effects were and I was okay with them, it seemed worth it to finally be able to become comfortable and happy living as myself. I remember being so happy that day. It felt like I had finally made it. I was finally going to start making progress toward actually being happy with being myself for the first time in my life.

While I couldn't stand living as a male and really disliked the effects of testosterone, lately I can't help but wonder if things would ultimately be better for me to live as a male with severe gender dysphoria. I was so happy to free from testosterone, the changes to my libido, thoughts, emotions, and outward appearance felt like a significant improvement. Going back to living as a male is not an appealing thought, in fact, it makes me extremely upset to think about, but the negative side effects of the hormone therapy on my genitals is also making me extremely upset. So now I'm very torn between two options, and I don't like either of them. It has actually made me feel depressed enough that suicide seems appealing, but I'm determined not to harm myself, at least not yet. I would be hurting too many people to do that and my love for them is what also keeps me hanging in there. So I'm clinging to a small amount of hope that things can be better and that I haven't ""ruined"" myself as I seem to be thinking I have lately. If hormone therapy didn't have such negative effects on my reproductive organs I wouldn't even be here right now and I wouldn't be battling with such intense sadness and despair lately.

Before even getting into the informed consent clinic, I figured that the ""use it or lose it"" bit I had read several places online was enough to keep me from losing any size with my penis, which I will also say I'm totally okay with having. I wasn't in my younger years. I couldn't stand it back then and I wanted it gone so badly. As I grew older and having been on the internet for so long, I came to learn that people actually like girls with those parts. For once I actually felt relatively happy to have them, it made me feel empowered and attractive. It also made me feel like they didn't detract from me being female. 

Now this is where things get pretty embarrassing and exceptionally difficult to talk about. It feels so stupid and superficial of me to be this concerned with these things but I can't help it, it's how I feel, and there's no way that's going to ever change. I really hope this next part doesn't come off as bragging, because I'm not intending it be that, but I actually got fairly ""lucky"" in the genetic lottery in regards to my genitals and was given quite a big penis. I never actually knew it was big until a few years before I came out, and even after discovering that it did nothing for my self-confidence. Despite also being a virgin who has never been in a relationship with someone (this hurts me a lot too but it's another subject entirely) I never told anyone about it in real life during my time living as a male even though it could have possibly gotten me that type of attention I was so desperately yearning for.

With how often you see people pining for the big penises it's hard not to feel upset and worried about it becoming smaller. I'm not all that attractive so I also can't help but feel like it was my possibly my only redeeming physical feature. It's certainly the only one people have expressed actual attraction to in my very limited interactions with others online after starting to feel comfortable with my body thanks to starting transition. People seemed interested in what I had (both guys and girls) and would express how much they wanted that part of me. It made me feel desirable for once and the thought of having lost that, possibly permanently, hurts a lot. As I said before, I'm still a virgin and have never had a relationship in my life so it's upsetting to think that I've sabotaged my genitals before ever getting to use them with someone. I've been yearning to find love with another person for such a long time, most of my life at this point as a matter of fact, and I'm thinking that what I had might have made that person very happy, but now it's possibly gone forever.

It's extremely difficult to find information on this subject and what I have found mostly says the loss of fertility and shrinking of both the testes and penis are irreversible, but I have on rare occasions found sources that say it's not irreversible, and at least in the case of fertility, can be regained by going off of hormones and blockers. I'm hoping that there's at least one person here who is both willing to read this mess of a post I've made and can also provide some insight that will ease my mind and emotions on the subject. I'm hoping someone can tell me that I haven't ruined my body, and that I reverse the changes if it comes to me needing to do that.

I've actually already discussed these things with my endocrinologist and showed her an article about a trans woman who was able to produce a child after several years on hormones which gave me some hope, but both that and the response from my endocrinologist only temporarily comforted me. She reaffirmed that my feelings don't make me any less genuinely a woman, which is partially relieving because I've had people tell me I'm just a sick fetishist for being okay with my genitals and for still having an attraction to other girls. That was always hurtful when it happened... I believe that even if I were to discontinue hormones and transitioning that I'm still a woman on the inside, but I'd really like for it to not have to come to that. 

My endocrinologist also acknowledged that while it is possible to regain fertility, generally it should not be expected and that it varies from person to person, which is why they always inform patients to expect to lose that as well as the functionality of their genitals. The article I linked to her that had given me some hope was about a trans woman and her wife who were looking to not only conceive a child of their own, but to be able to breast feed that child as well. The woman who wrote the article mentioned that even after being on hormones for five years, she was able to stop them temporarily and produce viable gametes for reproduction. She then went on to mention that she did the same thing five years later, and was still able to produce viable gametes after being on hormones for a collective total of ten years.

I don't know where else to go with this post and I feel like I've rambled for long enough while still not fully or adequately conveying my feelings on the subject, so to summarize things...

I'm a 27 year old male-to-female who has been on hormone therapy for about two years and who is okay with her genitals, but is worried about the effects of hormones them. I'm very concerned about loss of size, loss of functionality, and loss of fertility. If hormone therapy for male-to-female transgender didn't have these effects it would be the absolute best thing that has ever happened to me, as this is the only part that bothers me. Given that I've never had a relationship with someone or sex, to lose these things (size, functionality, and fertility) hurts me emotionally and mentally more than I can properly describe. I want to love and be loved by someone else so badly that I feel like I need to be the best I can possibly be but it's as if neither path solves that, they just introduce different problems. Living as a male doesn't feel right, I feel depressed and uncomfortable having to be myself, but transitioning to female has the possible side effects of permanently destroying my sexual capabilities which also leaves me feeling depressed and restless with worry. Being torn between both options and with neither seeming appealing, and the possibility that the damage is already done with no going back, it leaves me feeling like suicide might be my only option. I hope it doesn't have to come to that because I don't want to hurt my loved ones, but sadly it seems pretty appealing at this point, though I will continue to fight against those feelings. I've been wanting to finally be truly happy for so long, as well as to find love but these things seem eternally elusive to me at this point. I'm desperately hoping someone here can help me with this, but I don't expect that to happen.

If anyone has the words to comfort me, or can confirm that all is not lost, or basically just restore my hope I'd appreciate it so much. I've been so broken down about this as of late that it feels like it's destroying me. I'll be surprised if anyone even bothers to read all of this, let alone is able to actually help me...

minibug,asktransgender,Does anyone have tips on coming out to their parents? Looking for advice,"Hi! I'm 15 (as my flair says) and I've known I was trans for a few years now, and a lot of my close friends know. I even came out to my brother a few months ago, but I never received a response to the email I had sent him. 

I want to make the next step and come out to my parents, but I'm struggling with exactly what I'm going to do. 

My parents are very... free(?) with what they want to say. They don't sugarcoat things, they say what they believe. And what worries me most is that I'm not sure what my parents would think. I'm thinking of coming out to my dad first because he's always been more level-headed and more inclined to believe me than my mother. 

They've said some... not so nice things about transgender people in the past, but they weren't really saying mean things *about* them, I guess just using them more as the butt of a joke. Recently my dad made a comment about gay people while we were out at dinner that struck me as awfully homophobic but the conversation we were having got cut short, so when we came home we finished the conversation.

He wanted to make sure I knew that he didn't hate gay people, or transgender people. He said he knew being gay wasn't a choice, and he's fine with people being gay, he just doesn't like people using that fact to push their own agenda, using that as leverage. (e.g., pedophiles or zoophiles wanting pedophilia or zoophilia to be legal, using the fact that gay people can marry as an excuse for why they should be able to.) I'm not sure how many people do that, but I assume at least some do.

I really do want to come out to him, but I struggle at being independent. I also like knowing what people think before I tell them so I can gauge their response. He only told me that he knows being gay isn't a choice, not trans. Now, he may have thought he implied that, but when I take everything he says at face value and nothing more, I'm not so sure. 

This post is really long and rambling (whoops), but I just wanted to know if any of you had any coming out advice for a situation like mine? Thanks!"
nate4ward,asktransgender,Question for mtf,"I personally plan on having GCS and at one point couldn't figure why any transgender person wouldn't want it assuming there was no financial restriction.

natspriwat,asktransgender,Am I transgender or is there something very wrong with me?,"Hi everyone. I know, this is another ""Am I trans"" thread but I looked up dozens of other previous threads and none of them match my experiences closely enough so I decided to post my own. I'm sorry. Also, I'm sorry for the length of the post but I had to fit everything in.

First of all, I'm 21 years old AMAB. I've always been a crossdreamer. The only way I could get aroused is by imagining myself as the opposite gender. During and after um, pleasuring myself, I remember thinking, wow It must feel so good to be a girl it's a pity I'll never be able to experience it in any way.

The first time that I've actually thought about being a girl was at the age of 18. I've always been a social recluse, mostly due to social anxiety and lack of social skills. A girl had asked me out on a date and even though I'd never been interested in dating anyone I decided to take this opportunity and see if anything somehow clicks and I become normal. Long story short, it definitely didn't work out and I went back home thinking that I should never ever attempt going on a date again. (Even though I wanted it to work out because I didn't want to be alone anymore) I started thinking about what's wrong with me every day, and I thought about the away I get off. (I usually just repressed it and thought of it as nothing more than a fetish) I thought, life would have been so much better if I was a girl. I could imagine myself dating someone and going out and having fun if I was a girl. I could express my femininity. I started googling things like ""lesbian stuck in a man's body"" and felt excited thinking about personality traits and things that I do that are considered feminine. Then I remember that I'm not a girl and I'm never ever going to be one so I repress the thoughts and think about how being a man. I remember thinking that if I were to wish for anything it would be that I'd been born a girl. I got teary eyed thinking about how I'd soon grow facial hair and eventually no longer look like an androgynous teen.

This remained on my mind for the next couple of years but I repressed the thoughts. I even entertained the thought that I'm just a feminine gay man for a while and it was liberating because I've always wanted to express femininity freely. Obviously, I knew that I wasn't and I soon came to terms with it and just stopped thinking about my future mostly by gaming and spending time on Reddit for hours. In social situations, I sometimes imagined being a girl but as I always did, I immediately repressed the thoughts.

Recently, my mom (who I currently live with) called me out on my lifestyle. She told me to call some friends and to go out and have fun with them. She pointed out that I'm never going to find anyone to spend my life with and I can't live alone for the rest of my life. This made me think about my life again and I hid in my room and cried. Soon after, I decided to start exploring the thoughts that I'm repressing. This is when I started spending an unhealthy number of hours looking up transgender stuff, timelines, resources, etc. It's almost become all I think about. Yet, there's still that nagging thought that every day eventually resurfaces: I'm not a girl and I could never be one. This is just a fantasy of yours. That's when I feel like shit again. I know I could never transition. How could I do that to my family, that I'm so close to? I'll just be considered a freak anyway and never be perceived as a girl. Why can't I just own up being a man?

Although I feel like transitioning to a girl would bring me happiness, I remember that I only started having these thoughts after realizing that if things continue the way they are going, I have no future. It feels like I'm just depressed and trying to start over my life, seeking happiness. Now that I think about it, this seems to be a recurring theme for me: I switched subjects in high school in order to pursue a different career path only to end up feeling indifferent, I cut my long hair only to regret it, I switched from a PC to a mac only to end up going to a PC again... It sounds silly but I'm always trying make changes in my life that I think would make me happy, only to end up feeling indifferent about it. What if I simply have severe self esteem issues and this is just my mind trying to find a solution again? I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing is even dysphoria or if I'm just trying to convince myself that it is. I'm so tired of thinking yet I can't repress any of my thoughts anymore. The more that I think about it, the more I feel like this is a bad idea and it's not me yet I can't imagine myself as a male either. It's a stalemate."
kuriatsu,asktransgender,"Voting, post name change? And where do I go from here?","So...My name change went through and I was notified on oct.7th, 2 days prior to the mail-in Voter registration date requirements.

I work graves so I haven't had a chance to do anything at all about mailing the voter registration in, but now that the 9th has passed, and due to the timing of the name change, I have to ask....Am I even eligible to vote in this current election?

mahou-nova,asktransgender,"Is this sort of ""reversion"" normal?","I'm sure the answer is *yes* but I thought I'd ask anyway \^\^;

At the moment, I don't pass --neither as androgynous nor as female. Mostly, it's because I can't shave worth a damn, beard shadow's a bitch, and I don't have makeup. Despite this, I've been slowly trying to incorporate effeminate articles of clothing and accessories into my daily out-and-about attire because... reasons. Consider it a necessity.

So far, the list of effeminate things is pretty small and not all too conspicuous:

* long nails
* a sleeveless turtleneck (albeit worn underneath a button-up and/or men's hoodie)
* knee socks or thigh-highs
* a bracelet

However, yesterday I decided to take a big step (for me) and wear a grey *ladies'* hoodie to my 4-hour Saturday class instead of my men's one. I also ended up wearing a scarf and covering up most of my face the entire time because god almighty that beard shadow. Also, sick.

While I'm not surprised that I ended up feeling exceedingly uncomfortable by the end of class, what's really concerning is that, in the aftermath, I feel like I've somehow... ""reverted"". I currently have absolutely no desire to wear anything effeminate and my nails are starting to annoy me. It doesn't feel like an ""I want to go back in the closet"" reaction, more like all the feelings and urges that drove me thus far have just... vanished?

Is this... something that happens? Some kind of hyper-response to a stressful situation?"

Kodachromeo,asktransgender,Advice on how to start over? 27yo transwoman.,"I just had a pretty bad fight with my mom that ended in tears and with her almost kicking me out of the house. Had a panic attack and now I'm trying to calm down and type this post. 

I've been unemployed for a while now and  I asked my parents if I could move back home and they allowed me to stay in my old room. I had come out to my old friends just before this and not one stuck by me. I'm feeling very alone. It's been a rough couple of months for me since moving back and I was feeling very down about a lot but I found the courage to come out to my parents on my birthday at the end of August. They were not supportive and didn't understand and lately things are very tense.

I feel so bad that my parents won't accept me. I almost want to just cut my hair off and start applying to jobs as a male again, not that I pass at all right now but I try to be as androgynous as possible for now. My mother feels like I'm taking her son away and my father won't say more than two words to me or make eye-contact. 

So, as were arguing over how I'm throwing my life away I suggest that maybe I ask my brother to let me crash on his couch if they didn't want me here and she said he wouldn't like that since it turns out that she outed me to him and he didn't want anything to do with me and didn't want me around his kids. That really hurt. 

I'm sorry if this post is a mess but all my emotions and thoughts are just spewing out of my brain and I'm panicking because I don't know what I'm going to do. I only have a few hundred dollars left and I'm trying to figure out how to make a move. 

I feel like just starting over in another city away from my family and to find my place in life. I've read about how Portland, OR is the place to be if you are trans and after researching a bit that's where I want to go. No matter what I have to do to survive there, I'll find a way. 

So how should I approach this? I feel like going to a pawn shop tomorrow and selling everything they'll take and then hopping on a plane and finding somewhere in Portland to live is probably not the way to go. So any advice? Should I stick it out until I can save up some more money and then move? 
Anything you can offer advice or otherwise is greatly appreciated.

Prosaucian,asktransgender,Did anyone else lose weight on HRT [MTF],"I've heard that a lot of people have trouble losing weight, or gain weight when starting HRT. But, I've had the opposite. I was around 136 lbs before HRT, and now I'm 118, 120 clothed, which is just barely above ""underweight"". I haven't really changed much about my diet though, except that I don't really drink soda anymore. The only other explanation I can think of is loss of muscle mass, which I'm sure has happened given how heavy things seem lately. "

I've been trying to figure out how I identify for months, with nothing ever seeming right. Whenever I ask myself, ""who am I?"", I always come up with ""I am me"". I'm kind of a smart ass, but I actually took that thought quite seriously today. I am who I am. This is also coming right after having a very good hair day (with my getting longer hair from being AMAB) and I realized that I like who I am (for the most part). While I do envy girls, I can be quite comfortable as a guy. I'm fine with people calling me ""he"", but I secretly enjoy when people refer to me as ""she"", usually because they only see my hair from behind. I want to be thin, but I love lifting weights. I had to stop myself from saying thank you when my friend commented on how he thought I kind of looked like a girl from behind. 

So, yeah, this is me finally coming out to myself as being non-binary transgender. Wow that feels great to say. Now if only my close friends were more open minded, but that's a post for another day. "

As you can tell, I've been feeling pretty salty about it. 

I've already asked back in August, and last weekend they came to my college and I was very happy, and letting everything coexist. I even considered asking them about it while I was there.

I had that momentary paranoia about running out of time (which I posted about earlier this week!), but the warm responses made me feel a lot better.

Then I crashed while looking for summer jobs, as I realized just how bad I would have it if I transitioned, but at the same time, I realized that I had to more than ever, as it was the only way to leave of this constant cycle of doubt.

Even though I'm 19, they're still paying for my life, so I need to convince them that this is something worth doing. I feel selfish, because they never wanted this to happen to them, to have their eldest son become their daughter. Extended family's pretty tight-knit, too, and I've had this paranoia that anything I do will result in this domino effect of destruction.

So please, Reddit, calm me the fuck down and tell me how to approach this, and even tell me whether or not this is worth doing now given how fucking terrified I am.

soso_throwaway,asktransgender,Facial hair removal questions,"First I'd like to check whether this understanding is correct: HRT may reduce body hair somewhat (or it may not), but will do nothing for facial hair. So the options are to shave forever, get laser, or get electrolysis. Electrolysis is somewhat more expensive and more painful than laser, but will be definitely permanent while under laser some can regrow eventually, so to not worry about facial hair ever again after a while, one ought to do electrolysis.

Now I am Asian and also suspect that my facial hair isn't as ""much"" as the average male person's, though I'm not sure how to confirm if that is true or not. Does that mean there may be less follicles making things faster/less expensive or does it not really matter because I don't understand how facial hair growth works?

Also how do you actually find a place to do this (assuming that electro is the answer). Look on Yelp for somewhere rated highly, then tell them you're tired of shaving and want to get rid of it, then go from there? Or what? (I will be presenting as male for quite a while still so that seems like the best excuse). How do you make sure they're trustworthy and will do things right and not try to scam people?

Morilynx,asktransgender,"Adam's Apple Reduction, is it worth it?","Hi!

About a month ago I saw an ENT physician to consult about having my Adam's apple reduced. Prior to that appointment I was completely sure I wanted it reduced. Afterwards, I felt  terribly ambivalent. 

Because he told me that my Adam's apple ""isn't that prominent"" and that ""a lot of women look like that"". He also warned me that the procedure can (in rare cases) leave a rather ugly scar and I'm really not sure if I dare to take that risk. 

But the thing is, I don't agree with him at all. I think my Adam's apple is very prominent and I have yet to see a ciswoman with one that looks like mine. It's not like it's extremely big or so, it's just that it's very visible from every direction. I actually really dislike my Adam's apple and if it wasn't for the risk of getting a noticeable scar, I would have had it reduced in a heartbeat. I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could give me some thoughts about this. If you have had your Adam's apple reduced, was it worth it? Did you get a scar and if so, did it heal well? What was your thoughts prior to the procedure?

And if you are thinking about having it reduced, what are your thoughts surrounding this?

I have no problem with her being trans but I am attracted to feminine features and looks.  Every time I have meet with her she hasn't dressed up at all.  I told her I want her to be comfortable and all that and she still is cute anyway.  

She has started asking about what our relationship is.  Telling her friends and family about me and all that, hoping to date.  I want to talk to her about how I feel saying I was interested in her when she dressed up feminine and asking her when she plans to start taking hormones and everything but I don't want to make it seem bad or negative in some way.  I tell her how supportive I am and beautiful she is all the time, I just want her to know that I want to be with her for who she wants to be and sees herself as aka a female.  I don't know how to bring it up and explain it to her though.

Sorry if this is a dumb question and I hope I worded it right so you know what I'm trying to say.  Any advice would help me."
mattylion,asktransgender,moving to colorado...,"hey guys and gals. im considering moving from ohio to colorado springs with a friend that has something lined up already. well if i can make some big decisions this month. (sell or keep certain things lol)

but anyway obviously i know not to go without trying to find a job as well. but more worried about being trans and moving and finding a new doctor and everything. just super scared really to leave my comfy bubble that i made for myself here. just kind of want something different though at this point in my life. 

i feel like im over like the half way point in transitioning aka hormones full time etc but no surgeries and still need electro.

i just feel scared and dont think i can actually do this. "
amon_erin,asktransgender,Presenting in public?,"Okay, I've had enough of presenting as male in public. I ordered a wig last night. I'm still afraid of doing this because I will very much not pass. Appearance, voice, mannerisms, &amp;tc. I don't really care, though. I just need some tips. I want to get my eyebrows done and my back waxed, but I have no clue where to go or start. No clue how to makeup (I don't want to, but I need to cover up the beard shadow). I need to stop debating about getting my ears pierced and just do it (going to do plugs, because I've always wanted to and have been too lazy). And I need more clothing, but I feel weird asking my cis female friends to go shopping with me, but I don't want to go alone. I'm nervous about all the things I need to do.

I'm still staying boy mode at work for now because that's not going to be fun coming out there.

tl;dr: I need tips for starting to present in public. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I feel bad for forgetting about our trans brothers and everyone else. I'm a bad sister. :("
Tgheidi,asktransgender,[NSFW] I feel disgusted when I touch my own genitals. But I am sexually frustrated. Is prostate orgasms really a thing or just a myth?,"Help. Please.  I lose all my libido once I put my hand on that disgusting thing between my legs.

I don't know if ""myth"" is the right word since English is my second language. But hopefully you get what I mean. I find it hard to believe you can reach orgasm by anal penetration. This just seems too good to be true.

And are there any downsides to anal penetration? Would your sphincter muscles really become lax and harder to control?"
PunAboutBeingTrans,asktransgender,What are your experiences with the effects of Spiro? Wondering what I can expect.,"So I just recently went to the first doctors appointment where I discussed Gender Dysphoria and HRT with an actual primary care physician. I've been going to a therapist for awhile and so I came to the appointment ready with a letter of recommendation.

It went well, she referred me to a nearby endocrinologist to get me onto Estrogen, and was willing to prescribe me 100mg of Spiro immediately. 

She said it would probably be a few weeks before the Endo would have an availability, but I'll be calling them soon and setting up an appointment. 

What I'm wondering is what I can expect as far as the effects of being on spiro only for a few weeks. I know there will most likely be little to no physical changes, I'm more interested in the mental effects. 

Would love to hear from other people who've experienced a similar situation before :)"

dnalbes,asktransgender,NYC primary care/hormones,"I'm going to be moving to New York City at the end of this month, so I'm on the hunt for a PCP, preferably one who will take over my testosterone prescription with a minimum of fuss. I'm not opposed to seeing an endo exactly, but I'd feel more comfortable with a PCP who had taken the trouble to learn about hormones for trans people and, besides, it's more convenient.

It looks like Callen-Lorde (the obvious answer) is only taking new patients in the Bronx, which will very likely be rather inconvenient. They direct you to Apicha in lower Manhattan (or, more precisely, tell you to call Callen-Lorde about an appointment at Apicha...). Anyone have experience with them?

(I've been on T five years. I don't care if the doctor/clinic does informed consent when starting someone on hormones (though bonus points if they do, as a matter of principle), but, if you're asking me for a letter at this point, I probably don't want to be your patient.)"

srsmeup,asktransgender,SRS with Chett/Saran?,"I've narrowed my SRS down to Thailand. I don't like many of the surgeons in the US and I think Chett's results look better imo. So, a few questions.

I've been on HRT for 9 months, what kind of proof does Chett accept for the 1 year standard? I suspect a name change suffices for being out a year right?

I've seen only a couple stories about Saran, but pictures of his work. Does anyone know where I can find any? 

Regarding skin grafts, and this is mainly why I wanna see Saran's results, I am well endowed, a lot to work with. Has Chett ever NOT done a skin graft? Anyone emailed him pics of their genitals before to get an estimation? Was it accurate? (Assuming you went through with the surgery.)

What's the general process like for scheduling a trip? That is, could I schedule it for March of 2016, or is that too far ahead, especially since I won't have been on HRT for a year for another 3 months?

I figure if I do Chett, he has his own therapist or whatever to get the SRS letters, since he wants them a specific way. I've seen some people were gendered male on their clinic ID card. Anyway to avoid that, even though my sex is F on my passport? Funny, I read the therapists over there get really confused if your legal sex is F but you have a penis, sounds like I'll have a great time explaining things.

I'm tempted to take the vacation time and travel back to the East coast and fight for the ability to see my family. Hell, I'll go to every mass at their church if I have to - but I can't decide if it's worth it or if I'm just letting myself get played by an emotionally abusive parent. "

It's only the second day, but so far I've experienced mood swings that switch almost instantaneously. One moment, I'm small talking with a stranger and smiling and the next moment, I'm purposefully pressing the elevator close button while glaring at strangers so they can't get in the elevator with me. I've also done some really childish things too like throwing a fit when a public restroom was closed for cleaning. 
My sex drive is definitely higher as well which is weird since I basically had no sex drive for the past few months on pills.

Is all of this stuff normal on injections? The sex drive part gets me worried because, to me, it feels like my testosterone is coming back up. 
Also, for the record, my estrogen levels were very low on the pills. I was at about 50 pg/nl and I got switched to injections in hopes of bringing it up. Is the sudden jump in estrogen the reason why I feel this way?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Am I transgender? Similar stories?,"I am 20 years old and male. Since I was in about first grade I have imagined myself as a girl and daydreamed about it and wished for it. I didn't think it was even possible but I would hope I'd wake up a girl one day. As I got older these fantasies became more detailed and took up a big portion of my life and by adolescence it was sexual. I was a meek small kid until puberty and even after puberty I am skinny and 5 foot 7"". I always peed sitting down. I had a lot of female mannerisms that my parents punished out of me. I grew up and currently act androgynous. I always wore neutral gender clothing. I am definitely every form of autogynephilic. I wish I could be a girl and have a vagina and breasts and soft skin and be able to do my nails, hair, mannerisms, voice, and clothes permanently. I am indifferent to my body now. My demanding male sex drive makes me feel dysphoric. However I've always been attracted to woman and I am told I am pretty handsome. So I'm scared if I transition I'll look worse conventionally speaking. I am also engaged to my fiancée and she is not a lesbian. I would like to have a female role and pronouns except in the case for my family because my family is fundamentalist conservative Christian and being called daughter by especially my dad would feel awkward and humiliating. But being called mother wife ma'am Ms. Mrs. Miss she her woman girl all sound appealing and better to me than being called him he father uncle. I've always sympathized with woman more than men and tended to be friends with them more than men. Also the only reason I am talking about this now is because I've been dependent on my family my whole life and this was always impossible. I even compartmentalized the idea of being a woman as a only a fantasy my whole life because I didn't think it was possible and I was scared. However whenever I masturbate the dysphoria goes down but is still there. I'm also scared that I won't be passable and I don't want to look like a hybrid of the sexes. However I enjoy sex as a man and masturbation but I've always dreamt of being penetrated and I've always thought that would feel so much better. I never was turned on by the idea of penetrating a woman but I was always turned on by fingering eating out playing and cuddling woman. I was turned on by being submissive and rarely being dominant. The fantasies have disrupted most of my life because of how overbearing they are. They disrupt concentration and many hours out of the day and constant thinking about it. However the sexual fantasies are usually being a lesbian or with a man I don't know even though I am not attracted to men in the slightest. "

And yet, now that I'm almost there, it's like, I'm flat-lining. I don't know what's wrong with me and frankly, it's a little scary. 

I've put so much into this, wanted it so bad for so many months, and now that it's coming, I barely even want to put on clothes, do my hair, nails, anything.

I'm looking for any info on what happens, or suggested ways of doing it. I'm mainly wondering if testosterone production will resume normally as it did. And also will I fully masculinize, or just end up androgynous. I am not very worried about left-over breasts, as they never really grew. But that may be because of my very low weight, I am worried that after detransition, if I gain weight, will it go to my breasts.

I have an appointment with a gender therapist already but haven't told her. I've decided to maybe tell her after, depending on the outcome.  
I can't wait anymore to not suffer from having to cope everyday with dysphoria and embodiment fantasies (crossdreaming) :/.  
I'm so afraid she'll just pack up and leave while melting to tears honestly !  
Any advice or me telling her after seeing a therapist seems a good way ? Maybe I should leave her more clues before ?"
blargulous,asktransgender,Very confused (and terrified),"I can't believe I'm doing this...

So, most of my life (since at least early childhood) I've always identified more with female characters. I always secretly wished I was a girl, but suppressed it, seeing as it's not like I ever could. I'm 22 &amp; male btw.
But lately I've been dealing with a lot of issues now that I finally have the resources to do so. Mostly depression and social anxiety. Along with weight control (I've lost 65lbs since college, and have like 15~35 to go). I resent being masculine. Growing up I always had short hair, but now that I can make my own decisions I have extremely long hair (for a guy, probably medium-length for women). I dress en femme most of the time when I'm at home. I shave religiously as I *hate* having facial hair, legs too (an entire box of razors later!). I have been described as thin/lanky, but also masculine. Apparently I'm the only one who thinks I'm fat... even though I totally am. I definitely want a more feminine appearance. I'm pretty sure I'll never pass 100% as I have a fairly deep voice, and possibly chunky build. But maybe good enough to go out in a frilly dress? (I really like lolita fashion) I know with my anxiety if I decide to go full-on I could never face my family or coworkers again.
In response to the classical questions:
1) if i could be born or change sex 100% I would do so in a heartbeat.
2) when old which do i prefer? either, old is old. but in my 20s-40s there's no question I'd rather be female.
3) which sex are you attracted to? 99% female, but I've been attracted to males before, just very rarely. Wouldn't being trans-lesbian be way harder than being a hetero-man for finding love?
My interests are mixed: I like driving/riding fast and stem. But I also enjoy being artsy, sewing (especially making cute clothes.), and I spend a lot of effort on aesthetics. I'm terrified that if I do anything I'll be some Frankenstein monster that nobody could ever love. Did I mention I'm extremely lonely? I have 1 very good (male) friend whom I've opened up to. I haven't had an SO since high school. And logically I think my parents would probably not, like, disown me or anything. But still. I'm also afraid that I'm racing against time as I won't be young forever and HRT doesn't work as well the older I get, granted I'll never be 100% as I'm post-puberty :/. I'm not depressed to point of, like, suicide or anything about it, but I feel like I'm not really complete as a guy. But my social anxiety would get about 100x worse as I'll be learning to navigate an entirely new set of social rules.

*deep breath*

Is it possible I'm trans or just really fucked up? Either way, I'm terrified. Disclaimer: I mean no offense to anyone so please don't feel like I'm belittling your struggles. I know I tend to come off as abrasive."
DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,Second day on Hormones,"So this is my second day on hormones. right now I'm taking 3mg of estradoil (sp) and 200mg of spiro daily.

I didn't really think I'd experience much in the first couple days here. I kind of thought I'd have to wait a few months before I notice any changes. But that's not the case for me.

It's only one thing but it's pretty big. The one thing I noticed is that I'm so much happier. I actually feel right on estrogen. Has anyone else experience such relief on their first and second day of use? I'm sure i'll experience mood swings but for now things are good. 

The one thing that I'm not sure about is that I woke up with a headache. But I dunno if that's just caffeine withdrawal or the weather or my cold. *shrug - has anyone else experience a headache after taking estrogen their first day?

On spiro the one thing I noticed is it kind of feels like a high.  Plus I get drowsy too. It's really weird. I'm sure it'll go away after awhile of use. Anyone else experience that?"

I see people recommending Payless all the time in shoe threads here, but does anyone have experience with their physical stores? I know the level of transphobia will vary from location to location, but I want to know what I'm getting myself into.

Alternately, have you ever made an exchange there? I assume they'd have to order the right size and either send it to my house or call me when it gets in to the store, and if it's the latter then I'd be better off not bothering because I don't have a safe number

Please tell me any advice or anecdotes that you have 

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your comments! I weighed my options, studied the return policy, and decided to walk to the store. I told the employee that I'd bought them ""to give to a friend,"" and she seemed to believe it. As I thought, they needed to be able to call me in order to do an exchange, so I opted for the refund.

It gets so bad during the work week and it's only getting worse as I continue on HRT. I usually end up super anxious at the end of the day, either crying or on the verge of tears, usually with a headache, and many times feeling like I should give up. It's getting very hard to focus on the positive things when this is kicking my butt.

Getting called ""sir"" doesn't always hurt, but I don't like it and if I'm doing okay in public and someone calls me that it usually either sets me off on questioning myself again or ruining my mood. I still look so male that it hurts sometimes and there's nothing I can do about it (thanks baldness).

Does this sound like it might be social dysphoria? It was bad before HRT, but not this bad."
gruniniuw,asktransgender,"My mother will not accept my son [16/m] is bi-gender and tells him ""Pick a side, you fucked up saying it's non-binary."". My son is also facing bullying for coming out.","EDIT: Typo in title, I meant bi-gender.

Our son Steve came out to us a week ago as bi-gender, and we praised him for being so open and honest; it was very difficult for him to talk about this to us until now. Steve is a pseudonym, btw, for anonymity.

Steve prefers to dress feminine most of the time, and uses the name Madison (""Maddy"") most of the time, he likes looking like a goth girl, black crop tops, skirts, sports bra under the crop top. He's even asked us about buying prosthetic breasts to wear to make Maddy feel more real to him.

This should not be confused with cross-dressing or any fetishism etc. it's who he is; he says Madison is him, but the ""real"" him. He also doesn't like the concept of ""dead names"".

he says this affects his love life, can't find a girl who likes her for who she is (when he's Maddy).

He uses the pronouns he or she depending on who he's as. 

We went down to my mother's in Regina for the weekend, and told her about this, and she said to us:

&gt; Pick a side, you fucked-up. No such thing as bi-gender. Bi-fuel, yeah but not bi-gender. Boy or girl. Sheesh, what did the state of West Virginia ever do to you?

My son does not like the pronouns they or them, he prefers he or she depending on which gender he passes as (he goes as male for high school for now, but says he'd mostly be Madison, his female side, about 85-95% of the time, without need for gender reassignment).

We live in West Virginia, a state which is seen as a Southern state (is it?) and LGBT issues aren't as big an issue, as say, racial profiling.

As it is, we're Canadian expats in West Virginia, only here due to my husband's US work visa, we're from Yellowknife originally.

My son told me how people in highschool hate him for coming out, and boys in his class tell him ""pick a side, ffs"" or ""you're not a real man, you're a wimp"".
His high school won't take any action and insists there's no such thing as genderfluid , genderqueer or non-binary, dismissing them as ""trendy labels invented by Tumblr nerds"", insisting you're either man, woman, or transman/rtranswoman but nothing more.

As his mother, I'm not sure how to help him, he has repeatedly told me he wants help but I really have no expertise in this area.

I would appreciate advice from people who know more about this."

SarcasticNut,asktransgender,Question about interactions with my sister,"Hello everyone! I need your help with a family situation that I'm dealing with. 

About a month ago my (very pregnant) sister finally laid her cards on the table in regards to me being transgender. She proceeded to say some pretty awful things to me, probably the worst that's ever been said. Things like how I still look like a boy, how she doesn't understand why she's supposed to humor me with this, and why she's expected to call me by a different name, as that's unreasonable to her apparently. I should say that until the end, I tried to stay as diplomatic as possible because this was really important to get right.
I ended the call pretty strongly however, basically in tears telling her to go f&amp;#$ herself. I'm not mad in a sense that I'll never forgive her, and she is pregnant and I didn't handle coming out with her as well as I could have, and will be totally fine with her as long as I get a sincere apology to my face about it. 
However, she's giving birth to the first grandchild (nephew) in our family very soon, and I don't want to miss it out of spite. BUT, I don't want to send the implication to her that what she said is ok in any circumstance. What do you guys think I should do?

GalaxySpacecats,asktransgender,My parents are still wrongly gendering me and its been a year :( Advice?,"I don't want to sound like a jerk to my parents so I often don't constantly correct them I've for a year now have tried giving them space and told them a couple times that I'm a guy. My mother is trying but my father isn't doing anything from what I've noticed it's like he is just allowing my mother to do everything instead. I don't know what he is thinking he doesn't speak much. 
My mother is trying but so clearly she messes up and sometimes because I think she is embarrassed she still openly in public places or with other family calls me she. 
It's been a year a little over a year now and its starting to distress me. I'm starting to think should I start constantly correcting them? But I don't want them to feel like i'm de moralizing them. Or maybe i'm thinking it isn't going quick enough. But even with the corrections its so little around others as if I'm a embarrassment and I've taken notice to this because in public they'll whisper ""He"" instead of just saying it. I feel stuck on do I correct them more openly? Or do I wait it out more? 
and what do I do when there whispering it like i'm a embarrassment?  IT sucks! and i'm so sad with it all...
maybe that's stupid I feel sad over it I don't know.

SafeHayven,asktransgender,Pain of losing family -- how do you deal with it?,"Just to be clear, I'm an older adult with employment and an advanced degree. I'm completely socially and financially independent, so not having family is simply an emotional issue for me. This is a major privilege, and it's not lost on me.

Since I've come out as non-cis, I've been rejected by my fundamentalist Christian, deeply cisnormativr family. The only people who affirm me are three younger (young, early 20s) cousins, all of whom live about 2,000 miles away. My elderly parents and even more elderly grandmother still talk to me, but they all intentionally deadname and misgender me and have told me not to visit unless I present as my birth assigned sex. Everyone else -- siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins -- has outright disowned me and no longer speaks to me. 

I'm a person who used to be very close to my family, and no longer having them in my life stings, like the pain of losing them to death all at once. It especially hurts not being able to be there to care for my aging parents, who live independently but really do need extra help and will need more and more as the years go on. I feel like I've failed my duty to take care of them, which gives me so much guilt. It's also terrible no longer being part of family events, spending holidays alone, having no one beyond my partner (also trans without  much of a family either), far away chosen family, one local friend (also trans), and a few local acquaintances to turn to.

I realize I'm fortunate to not be on the streets at 15 or to have some family left at all. I know I'm privileged, but it still hurts.

How do you all deal with family loss? I feel like I'm managing a massive amount of socially unacceptable grief, and it's slowly driving me insane."
catfusion,asktransgender,"Stealth Shaming/Stealth Shame? (long, sorry)","Preface: First, I want to *clearly state* : **This is not directed at this forum or anyone here.** I'm commenting on something I've noticed in some recent face to face interactions I've participated in, or been proximal to, and I'm interested in having a dialog around that. 

Sorry if my choice of words is judgmental; I'm trying to come to an understanding about this, and probably trying to work out some of my own internalized feelings about things.

---

That said, I've seen both an implied and explicitly stated attitude that 'visibly and openly out as trans is *better*' and a kind of subtle, almost 'reverse shaming' thing directed at people who aren't really open and out about it.  

(The latter reminds me of some of 'big is beautiful' type comments that are maybe meant well, but maybe not so helpful; 'Be proud of who you are!' 'Just be you!' which imply that the person they're directed at is acting out of shame or being fake somehow. And maybe there is a parallel there - there's not anything inherently virtuous abut being thin, but recognizing that doesn't make someone who diets and exercises inherently shameful either.)

I'm in a kind of mood today, so I'll go ahead and just bluntly say that I've most often seen this voiced by people who don't really have a choice about being out. (I'm not necessarily talking about 'passing'; there's also situations where someone's transitioned in a workplace where they've been employed for many years, etc..)

Sometimes it's accompanied by a kind of 'not everyone's able to be so strong and brave' kind of reassurance (which again, implies that to do otherwise is rooted in weakness and fear/cowardice.)

And I've also seen a lot of this kind of talk being voiced by people who do live more 'stealth', attributing their choice to continued internalized transphobia, or describing this choice as 'another closet.' It feels like they often view their choice as lesser, a reflection of weakness, and there is usually a total avoidance of all things trans and association with anyone else who's trans outside the moments when they feel the need for validation of shared experience.

For myself though, sometimes it feels like, 'What am I supposed to do?' Should I *stop* doing the things that I do to manage and mitigate my dysphoria, and *invite* that in order to appear more ambiguously gendered and therefore obviously trans to others? Should I wear a trans flag all the time (maybe on an armband?) to ensure others know I'm trans and can focus on and respond to that?

Part of my own issue is that I don't really think I'm personally ashamed of who I am. But my gender identity tells me, 'You're female'; it *doesn't* tell me, 'You're trans', (and none of the 'third gender' or 'two spirit' type stuff resonates with me as anything I can *personally* identify with or relate to, although I recognize it does for some people.)

And I hear how these same 'out and proud' people suffer harassment and mistreatment, and how that impacts their life and emotional states. (No one enjoys being harassed. It's why it's harassment.) 

I see how I'm treated differently by people in situations where I'm marked as trans, whether that's the looking for evidence that I'm 'really male' in my appearance and behavior, subtle things like the quality of service at a restaurant (including where I'm seated), the way even 'allies' will treat me in a manner that's awfully similar to a certain condescending and offensive attitude well meaning people will take with the differently abled, and the related thing where my being trans eclipses all other aspects of who I am or might be.

I didn't like being read as and treated like a guy, nor the interactions I was expected to engage in as such. And I don't like being treated like 'a trans' and those interactions a whole lot either - that sure wasn't a motivating factor in transitioning for me. (Reflecting on it, I realize there's a lot of similarity in the discomfort I feel/felt in both scenarios...)

I do feel the need for some validation and understanding of shared experiences, but all too often, there's very little common experience besides being trans.

And I'm not sure I owe 'the community' anything at the cost of my personal happiness and well being - and that pressure actually feels remarkably similar to the pressure I felt from the 'greater community', i.e., society in general, to conform to expectations of male/man/masculinity.
 
I'm not quite sure how to proceed - oftentimes social reminders of being trans are a source of dysphoria and I don't want to focus on it, in the same way physical reminders (and subsequent aversion of focusing on genitalia or similar) can be.

The ideal situation is where being trans can be a known, but not marked or remarkable thing, and only comes up when it's relevant - which it isn't, most of the time, really. But I don't really know how to, or how best, to work towards a world where that's the norm and not the exception for our lives.

On the application is an area where I can clarify information about my gender identity, and I want to write ""Transgender"" in that field.

The problem is, I am not really out to anyone. I technically told my mom a few years ago, but I went back into the closet after she reacted negatively. For the past few weeks or so, I've been pepping myself up to come out again, but I not quite sure I'm able to do it. Not only am I afraid that things won't ever be the same between my parents and I, but my financial situation is still heavily dependent on them. 

The ED deadline for my preferred college is next month, and I doubt I would suddenly find the courage to come out by then. I was wondering if I could put my gender identity on the application now and worry about coming out a few months from now when things are little less hectic?

Also, what are my options if my parents don't want to pay for my college. I am a National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist and working hard to win that, and I am hoping to get some scholarships through my robotics organization, but beyond that, is there anything else I can try? Does financial aid care if I am disowned by my parents? I won't be 18 until my sophomore year of college, so what will happen until then?

thechiropteran,asktransgender,well i guess i just have questions all around,"The thought came to me last fall (ill be 21 in march for reference) that perhaps all the issues I'd had with feeling myself were because maybe i was meant to male. I've come to really like it. Like, REALLY like the thought of being a man. It all kind of felt like it finally made sense to me and how i felt about growing up as a female (i think the first time i actually felt bad about it was when i started growing a chest, because before that males and females were the same to me). But now i don't know. I still feel it in my soul that being a man would be better for me, but I don't know if this is how being trans is supposed to feel or if im simply riding on a random self suggestion. Could i just get some advice on exactly what it's supposed to feel like?"

I'm terrified of major surgery. I'm terrified of anaesthetic. I don't think I can handle the pain and 6 month long recovery. I'm pretty sure it'd traumatize me.

Like I said in the title, it's probably a dumb question, but this dog is my world and I would be upset if I lost the relationship I've built up with him over the past 3 years because he doesn't recognize me.  And my parents would hate it too since he doesn't listen to anyone except me.  He forgets who I am for a few minutes when I get my hair cut more dramatically than just a trim, and barks at me until I talk to him and pet him to calm him down.  But my voice will be changing so I don't know if I'll be able to talk to him to calm him down anymore, either.

So yeah, what have other people's experiences with their pets been during their transition? Have they recognized you or had to get used to you again every time you saw them after a dramatic change like your voice or facial hair?"

Sydney_TheThird,asktransgender,Question about being forced out at work and then a wall of text about it happening to me today!,"Hey there handsome gents, lovely ladies, and folks all over the spectrum! So my question is if you’ve ever been forced to come out or present at work? And if you have, or just got a little insight in your back pocket or purse, that you could share with me, I’d be really grateful!

You see, I work for a certain company that is known for having a strict “look” that all employees must abide.  I admit that I was letting my seniority, the lazy management team in our area, and overall charming wit to slip between the cracks as I got farther and farther out of bounds.  I had talked to an HR rep before and their answer was “if you present male, male look; if you present female, female look.  NO in between.  Well crap, I’m in that in between phase we all find ourselves at some point (except for those touched and crafted by God to sow envy in the trans community), so I procrastinated for as long as I possibly could.  Well it seems that four months of long hair, elegant fingernails, and emerging boobs were too much to ignore and it all caught up with me today.  Now to preface, pretty much everyone knows I’m transitioning and so far everyone (including managers) have been incredibly supportive.  The hour and half meeting I had today boiled down to: start presenting as female tomorrow, or get in to male “look” (aka cut your lush hair you’ve been growing for a year and trim you perfectly manicured nails).  Well I got my Sydney nametag and said “you better call me ‘she’ tomorrow”.

I’m so conflicted… on one hand, I’m not prepared for this.  I don’t even have a grace period it *has* to be tomorrow or I get heavily penalized.  I don’t think I come close to passing, my voice isn’t where it needs to be, and I’m not comfortable using the women’s bathroom at work considering these people have known me since before I even came out as gay! So I’ve been on a mad dash today getting restocked on stuff from Sephora, painting my nails, getting my hair straightened by my roommate, and general upkeep to get ready for tomorrow. I’m ridiculously nervous but also so relieved… I can finally stop living two lives at once and be in harmony.  I’m scared but at peace.  Anyway, if anybody is interested I’ll update you how it goes tomorrow and I think I have some stuff in the works that I’ll probably write a novel about in the next month.  Love you crazy people!!!!!

MechaMaya,asktransgender,"HRT got! Living in Las Vegas, here's how it went.","For people living in the Las Vegas area who are curious how to get started with HRT, this post is for you. Copied from my post on /r/MTF

&gt; So last Wednesday I went in for my very first therapist appointment, and he was on board with helping me get started with HRT right away. He referred me to a doctor who I then saw this morning, and by this afternoon I had pills in my hand. I was shocked at how fast that happened.
&gt; 
&gt; For those in the Las Vegas area, I highly recommend Dr Stoermer, who was incredibly helpful. Making an appointment was strange however, as they don't take ANY insurance for HRT appointments, and I had to pay in cash. So it was almost $200 to see him, but once I saw him he was the most helpful doctor. He gave me options for prescriptions and a choice of injections or pills, and I was quickly on my way. If you're in good health he won't require a blood test until 5 months into HRT to check hormone levels. I was in and out without fuss. (And I went in total boy mode, he doesn't care)
&gt; 
&gt; So if you can afford the cash to see him, it's worth the trouble you will save for going to another doctor who doesn't know what they're talking about. Once you have your prescription, your insurance takes care of that."

Upon telling a post-op trans friend of mine about it, especially the shame around whether or not I could have done more to take me out of the situation and prevent things from escalating, etc, she told me that she ""could imagine the situation being difficult"" for me, but ""no doubt a good lesson"" and that it would help me ""gain insight into how women are often treated by men"".    
    
It's not as if it'd the first time I've experienced that insight. But do I not deserve any empathy from my friend now that she no longer has her extra appendage and I still do? Reached out for support and basically just got told ""good for you!"". "

Coping_Amy_MTF,asktransgender,Crossing the Rubicon,"Between trips I had a therapy appointment on Friday and after years of questioning I ventured out of my house without wearing a single piece of male clothing under my jacket for the first time. My therpist was almost giddy with excitement and very supportive. I have some small gynecomastia that never went away, and seeing it shaped into the unmistakable profile of breasts by my bra felt so normal, and I no longer heard the background noise of dysphoria.

I followed it up by spending every hour I wasn't working in full girl mode, mostly in lounge wear (I am a simple girl).   Returning home, it was tough going back to 24/7 guy mode (I have a roommate). I feel naked without a bra. 

I am fortunate to have near feminine waist and hip proportions, I really want to start HRT, and desire to see how HRT might accentuate my features. Somehow, it feels like the right step personally. However, I am still on the fence with socially transitioning, risking job, love, family, etc.

I still have a long way to go before taking the transition plunge. Every step forward feels like I am moving in the right direction, and there is really no going back to the way things were before I admitted to myself that I am somewhere on the trans spectrum. 

Did anybody else have a similar break through moment when you knew there was no going back?"
oncerydia,asktransgender,My Brain is Being a Bully,"So this is like, one of the very strangest, scariest, and in some ways silliest things about being trans that I have experienced as yet. Some part of my own brain, that is below or outside my conscious awareness and control, is basically trying like hell to bully me into transitioning faster—and to a greater extent—than I'm comfortable with right now.

It works like this. Last week I started having body dysphoria, whereas I had basically none before (it was all like envy/wishing based dysphoria). This basically took the form of sudden and intense fear and disgust that would manifest out of nowhere as a result of me coming into contact in some way with my male characteristics. At first, it was limited to my facial hair, then body hair, then looking at myself in the mirror, and now it has seemingly taken up residence in my man-bits as well. And although the fear is tolerable (at first it was causing panic attacks, but I've brought it under control) and so is the nausea that I get from the feelings of disgust, it is still deeply unpleasant when it happens, and it happens ALL THE TIME now because I cannot avoid the triggering conditions any longer.

The insidious thing is, these emotions came from somewhere outside my conscious awareness and control. They feel very ""primal,"" very basic, very much not connected to my intellect or my higher emotional awareness. They feel intrusive, unwelcome, in a way that the ""normal"" dysphoria doesn't. At least that comes from a place that I can understand and connect with, even though I don't want to feel it. This, it is just like an outsider is projecting these emotions into my consciousness and I'm like STOP IT!

In addition to the unpleasantness from the emotions themselves, I have started to see secondary effects from them. I have apparently developed an aversion to putting shaving lotion on my face. Like I bring my hands up to my face and they just stop, inches from it, and I have to mentally force myself—with great effort and concentration—to go the rest of the way. I've also started feeling negative ""higher order"" emotions toward things like my man parts. Before, I never really actively *disliked* them; I just wanted to turn into a girl and so not having them was sort of like, okay, sure. But this morning I woke up like feeling ""why the hell does this have to be there, annoying me!"" And I was immediately like, ""WHOA, WTF."" It feels like it's similar to the aversion, in that part of my brain is trying to condition other parts of my brain to have body dysphoria, if that makes sense. Which it fucking doesn't. But oh well.

....Help? .....Anyone?........Bueller?"
Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Do others feel let down by some of the inherited medical language we use (also re HRT and inclusion)?,"OK, I've been reading the inclusion post and don't really want to wade in there, so I thought I might try talking about an issue in a related post. Partly because of my experiences IRL, since I'm lucky to be in a place where I have a face-to-face community. I've found queer spaces to be affirming and even painfully polite except when the issues of privilege (another topic entirely) or inclusion (women, men, GNC, as well as racial) come up. I really wish we didn't eat our young when we talked about those issues -- because that's exactly what happens: vulnerable people who are questioning and coming into a public space for perhaps the first time get frightened and disappear, only to be seen again at age 30 or something. I don't even want to think of worse consequences I keep having to push from my mind.

OK, with that really long preface, I wanted to say that something occurred to me when there was a really long and somewhat contentious discussion about ""HRT."" Specifically when questions about it were assumed to be about feminizing hormones/anti-androgens and people not feeling included by that assumption.

It got me thinking about how much of our language is inherited from medical terms that are actually extremely cis-normative. My understanding is that HRT has the default of referring to women because we've inherited it from menopausal therapy. In fact, even though HRT is also an inclusive term, therapy for cis (and sometimes trans) men is often called ART/TRT (androgen/testosterone replacement therapy) to differentiate it from other therapies; HRT for cis women doesn't even have another commonly used acronym.

Personally, despite sometimes using terms like MTF and FTM (both originally medical) earlier in life, I now feel really uneasy about them myself, though of course the rest of you are welcome to use them. I don't want to contribute to the [""activist language merry-go-round""](http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2014/06/on-activist-language-merry-go-round.html) by saying certain terms aren't ""with it"" anymore. But I do wonder whether some of these conflicts that sometimes poison good feeling in our community have a lot to do with language that still marks us as objects of study or medical care, as ""other."" And that there are cis-normative assumptions behind those terms (ie, MTF and FTM assume that your birth sex is the gender you transition away from), and those implicit assumptions divide us.

Anyway, I don't have any clear view about what exactly the problem is or what can be done (otherwise I guess I'd be submitting a post to Medium or something). Maybe others can help with their thoughts and open up the discussion here. Of course I have absolutely no control over the tone here, but can we make the effort to be polite? "
Morilynx,asktransgender,Pills in addition to injections? Is that a bad idea?,"So I've been on HRT for almost seven months now. It feels great and I'm loving all of the changes that I can see and feel so far. The only problem that I'm having is; my Estrogen levels are not where they're suppose to be. 


I started out on 4mg Estradiol pills. When I was at my 3-month check-up, I learnt that my Oestrogen levels were at 235 pmol/L and according to the nurse, that was pretty low so they increased my dosage to 8mg Estradiol. Testosterone was down at 0,2 nmol/L, which was all fine and dandy to me.


Two months later I do another check-up, they tell me that my Estrogen levels were at 351 pmol/L. Apparently, this was too low as well, so then I asked to be prescribed injections instead. So I got started on 80mg of Polyestradiol phosphate + Mepivakain injections every other week. 


Yesterday I was at my 6-month check-up and I had so far taken two shots (had my third shot today). And this time my Estrogen levels were down at 205 pmol/L and Testosterone had increased to 0,4 nmol/L.  

My doctor told me that my levels will build up over time because the injection stays in the body over such a long period of time. He told me I would need to have the substance of at least 5 shots accumulated in my body for my Estrogen levels to get to where they should be.


Now to my question; do you think it'd be okay if I took a pill or two (daily) of my Estradiol pills, in addition to my injections? I'm thinking just until I've had my 5th shot. That should increase my Estrogen levels a little bit quicker, right? Or should I be a good girl and do what the doctor told me to do and just wait?

I'm just so sick of waiting for my levels to be where they should be. What if I am missing out on effects that I would've had if my levels were higher? "

DecRand,asktransgender,How can I support someone having a hard dysphoric experience?,"I'm a cis dude in college, but I live with a number of trans people. This one boy across the hall from me isn't out to his family yet, hasn't had any hrt or surgery or anything. I've found that he's been having a really hard time at college, particularly with depression and dysphoria. I want to be a good friend to him, and to all the trans people I live with, in this hard time, but I don't know how."
genderboxes,asktransgender,I'm transitioning soon: how do I answer questions from my child's friends at her school?,"I'm ftm and planning to start HRT as soon as I can get it from my primary care provider. I'm not out yet (I'd rather wait until my voice drops), but I do present in a very masculine way with my hair, clothes, and often binding. The masculine presentation plus 5'10 height and being in a very gender normative neighborhood (too many yuppies and too few hippies in the neighborhood, despite being in a super liberal city) mean that I or my 5 year old daughter often get questions about whether I'm my daughter's mom or dad. Of course since I'm not out yet, I answer that I'm her mom, but I have no idea how to handle the gender topic once I am fully out. 

I can find info about talking to your own kids about transgender issues, but nothing about what to do if someone's kid says ""no you're her mom"" or ""why are you a boy now"". Is it ok to say something like ""I'm transgender so I used to be a girl but now I'm a boy"" to someone else's kid? Obviously they don't need more detail than that, but I'm afraid of overstepping parental bounds or angering parents by saying too much about a sensitive topic. It's somewhat little complicated by the fact that since these are school playmates of my kindergartener, she and I and my partner (cisdude, btw) all have to deal with these people until we move or she graduates. Folks have been nice so far but sometimes people change for the worse when faced with a trans person coming out.

Am I overthinking the whole thing? Is my example response from the paragraph above ok? Should I be careful to either use or avoid the word ""transgender"" in this kind of a case?"
zoecrowley,asktransgender,I'm really confused with what I am? Transgender or just crossdresser?,"Hi boys and girls. First of all I’m really sorry that this is such a long post, but I really need to ask for some advice from you because I think my situation is pretty weird. And thank you so much in advanced.

So I’m a 19 year old male who really wants to be a girl. I’m only sexually attracted to girls. I wish that I could be viewed as a girl, be treated like a girl, go to the movies as a girl, etc. I remember when I first wanted to be a girl was back when I was around 10, maybe even younger. There was this thing in a temple that I often visited, something like a wishing well where you can just throw coins in and make a wish. I remembered always wishing that I could have dreams at night where I become a girl (I actually knew that It would be impossible for me to actually become to girl in real life, so I wished that at least I could experience that in my dreams, I think I was matured at a pretty young age.) And the feeling is still with me to this day. 


I hate being a guy. I hate it and always feel like being punched in the stomach whenever I look in the mirror and see a dude with wide shoulders straight waist, big stomach, body hair (recently started shaving) and that ugly thing down there. When I see attractive girls, I have never imagined myself having sex with them, or as a male at least, I always want to BE them. I’m very emotional, and I hate the social conception that guys shouldn’t cry, and that guys have to be the dominant or the leading role. My biggest dream in life other than becoming a girl, is to become a successful rock musician (I'm a guitarist and singer, guess I will have to learn to both talk and sing in girl's voice), but imagining myself playing in front of 10,000 people as a guy is pretty disappointing, I'd rather be a ordinary girl than a male rock star. 


I wouldn’t say that “I know I should have been born a girl,” probably because I’ve been a dude for almost 20 years and it actually feels kind of weird to say that, but I DEFINTELY, DEFINTELY wish that I was born a girl (hope this makes sense). Unlike a lot of trans girls, I never really view myself as a girl, because I have a male body after all. And for the same reason, I always act really mascular, I try to behave and act like a guy, but it always feels like I’m acting. All the handshaking, and “whats up bro”,  ticking the “male” box on a form, being called a ”guy” or “boy” always make me feel depressed inside, like an engine without fuel. But I have to admit, being a guy is pretty easy and convenient most of the time, but that’s not what I want.



Anyway those are pretty “standard” things for a trans girl I guess, but here’s the thing that confuses the hell out of me… It’s the sexual fantasies that I have… I’ve been crossdressing for many years, but I only stay in my room and dress up in girls’ clothes everytime, and then….you know…get off, while imagining myself as a girl of course. I would be lying if I say that I don’t find it arousing to wear girls’ clothes and underwear, but there’s more, I don’t only want to dress up just to get off, I want to wear them all the time, and not only the clothes, I want to be a girl all the time. But maybe because I’m still living with my family and can’t crossdress full time, I always end up just doing it for sexual gratification. 


If you tell me that you can turn me into a girl in every way except that I won’t be able to have sex, it would be a little disappointing, but I would definitely do it, because I feel like that’s not the most important thing for me. Of course I would want a sexy body, but I won’t care if I don’t, and I won’t want to wear sexy clothing all the time, because that doesn’t really make me any more feminine, the most important thing is to let everyone else views me as a woman. I have two younger sisters, so I’m aware that womanhood isn’t all that perfect and glorious like on TV. But still the fact that I sexualize female clothing really makes me wonder if I’m simply just a crossdresser. 



And there’s another super weird thing. I would have this urge of wanting to be a girl for many days, and then one night I masturbate(feels like I’m trying to let go of all the stress and depression that has been building up from the urge),  after I’ve finished, I would feel depressed and empty like a lot of guys, but I would also feel really guilty and disgusted of myself for wanting to be a girl. All the wishes and feelings just disappear like that, but of course they all come back later, sometimes in a few minutes, sometimes a few hours, sometimes the next day, but almost never more than a day. I would tell myself “you are a guy”, “you have to be a man”, “you can’t let your family down”, though it always feels like I’m lying to myself and forcing myself to say those things. And this is really confusing to me, because it sounds like what a crossdresser would do and feel (there’s absolutely nothing wrong with crossdressing), but the problem is that I don’t know what I am. It’s like I have made this into a sexual fetish thing. Maybe I just want to be a girl because of my sex drive caused by the stupid testosterone. And after it gets released, I lose the drive, and so I stop wanting to be a girl. But like I said earlier, sex is not the only thing that I want. But I would think that maybe wanting to do all the other non sexual things as a girl is caused by this fetish too? Man it always makes me breakdown and feel like I have schizophrenia. 


I think that I definitely have that kind of fetish, but I’m just wondering if I’m a real trans. The thought of maybe I’m not and I will never be a girl makes me super depressed, but then after I xxxx, I won’t care anymore for a little while….but I would still hate my male self.


I do want to be a girl, but I also feel like I don’t deserve to be a girl. I feel ashamed, I feel disgusted, I feel like I’m a worthless piece of crap. I feel guilty for even calling myself trans, not because I think it’s wrong or feel ashamed of it, but because I think a sick person like me don’t deserve to be a part of the LGBT community, and I would be a disgrace to everyone. 


So I just wish to know what you think…? Do you have or ever heard of any similar experience? There’s no gender therapists around me, not even a regular therapist, so this isn’t really an option. There are a few psychiatrists, but helping the patients figuring out what they want isn’t really their job. Also I went to study abroad for a few years, and this year my health got super messed up, probably from all the stress and anxiety I’ve had throughout the years, that I have to stay home, and because of this I think I won’t be able to start HRT anytime soon even if I want to, as it makes you tired all the time. I’m also a bit chubby, 5' 8"" and 160 lbs (most of the weight is on my stomach, sigh). I’ve been exercising for 7 months now, though I’ve only lost about 8 lbs, and I definitely want to be at least 132 lbs before I start transitioning. I don’t have any friends because I have moved so many times, three different countries. Now I’m stuck at home every single day, I don’t know anyone in my home country, I feel so…..hopeless. 
So Thank you sooooo much if you have read all this, and please let me know what you think :)

I haven't felt anything sexual since I came out to my cis-hetero wife in March of this year.  Literally nothing.  We have agreed to rearrange our relationship because she is completely hetero.  

I know once I start HRT in January I'll have physiological and psychological changes, but this thing tonight was amazing, It awoke some hope that I might find myself in a relationship again with someone who can love me completely for me.

kiDsALbDgC9QmLFiIrrj,asktransgender,I'm not sure who to trust about HRT.,"These are all things I've heard about HRT:

- Pills are just as good as injections, it doesn't matter.

- Injections are way more effective and safer than pills.

- Spiro works just fine as an antiandrogen, and the side effects aren't that bad.

- The side effects of spiro are horrible. Cypro is a much more effective and safer antiandrogen.

- You don't actually need an antiandrogen if you're on injections. Estrogen is enough.

- Progesterone is not really something you need to worry about. You'll be just fine without it.

- Progesterone is essential, you need to make sure you have the right amount of it.

What all of this says to me is that no one really knows what's going on, and we're all just kinda stumbling around blindly. This scares me a lot. This is the body I'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life, and if I mess it up somehow, or even if I don't take full advantage of everything available to get the best result, I'll never forgive myself.

This particular occasion it said I was going to see Dracula: Dead and Loving It.  I tuned it on, the movie started, and I was like ""WTF why on earth would they make this so damn cheesy and bizarre"" but you know, a couple going to a ""haunted house"" in ""transylvania"" who has a creepy igor-ish butler, etc.  Eventually after they do the timewarp I'm like ""this is stretching it..."" and turn it off.  Later, find out the channel's been behind all day when I tune in for ""5th Element"" and end up seeing ""Bad Boys.""  

Second time I attempted it I was in college, the drama dept was live-acting some parts of it whilst the movie played and the audience yelled at the screen.  My ex was one of the people in charge of the thing, and made me come up in front of the audience and my (soon to be next girlfriend) and fake an orgasm in front of a room full of people I'd be nervous to engage in small talk, who then booed me for a poor performance.  

Then with all everyone's yelling and just how ostentatious the whole thing was I just got disgusted.  But it gets to this day, remade and put on a pedestal as some great work of groundbreaking gender/sexual breakthrough art that I as a member of the LGBT community should love.

Triggerseed,asktransgender,I feel like I want to die.,"A little NSFW.

I'm 18 right now. 

All my childhood, I never questioned if I was a boy or not. But, a few years ago, I sometimes had dreams about being a girl. Then, I sometimes wished I was born/turned into a girl, but I repressed it because, hey, I'm a manly man right? That can't be true. I had depression for some months now. Maybe I now know why. 

I like girls, and had a really cute ''girlfriend'' but I never did more than kissing with her because I felt like something was not okay with me, with my body... 

I recently started to read romantic mangas all of a sudden. Then I found one where the main character, a boy, gets turned into a girl by a god and with the time, he really becomes a girl (Not only the body, his feelings and heart start turning into a girl.)

I started to feel identified with him/her, Then I had the revelation of my life: I want to be a girl. I'm a girl. I somehow knew it all this time but didn't want to think about it. It felt wrong to think like that for some reason... But this body is not mine. I even lost almost all ability to get erections several months ago, it somehow just didn't felt right... I stopped masturbating several years ago, too. I let my hair grow long a couple times in my life, but I always ended up cutting it. I wear earrings, and girlish/unisex clothes. I have been uncomfortable with my genitals for some time, and wish they weren't there. I wish I seriously thought about this before. I could start a process now, but... I'm really manly in my appearence. My body, my height (1.87 cm)... 

I want to be a small, pretty girl, with a small chest, but it's too late to do something to change it. My body will not be smaller, I have a big back even for a man. I wish I realized before, my parents would have helped me, and when I was little I sure looked like a girl. Maybe I end up doing some bad things to myself. I feel really, really bad."
Blairnatalie,asktransgender,for those curious about waist training.,"So a week ago I posted about getting my Waist trainer, while the results weren't dramatic I figured I'd post to let yall know incase your curious. 

First day I got it I wore it for 2 hours, I've increased 2 hours every day and now it's quite comfortable wearing for 6-8 hours daily. I've just started excericisng while wearing it too (mine is okay with working out, despite the steel boning). 

My workout is now where near insane, it's simple. I mainly focus on my stomach, waist, thighs, and butt. 

Start off with 25 situps, 25 squats, 20 of those backwards sit up thingy where you raise your butt and legs in the air instead of your front. Followed by 20 more squats. 

I've yet to add yoga into this but I do plan on adding simple yoga moves to help boost my workouts. I still have no way of measuring but I'll look into getting a tape measure to see if it's actually taking effect.

I've noticed that the waist trainer Is much easier to wear then when I first got it. Not sure if anything is taking to effect? Or that it's working? Either way we'll know next week.

Photo isn't glamorous by any count, however this is how it sits after week one, 2/3 clasps, 6-8hr daily.

NicoNicoNeedy,asktransgender,Beginning transition in Georgia; How to speed up the process?,"I am waiting on my blood test results from Piedmont Health &amp; Wellness, a place I would say is quite friendly and homely to go to. 

However, at my first and only appointment so far, I was told my transition HRT letter needed to be rewritten under WPATH standards. I heard somewhere that they have in-house psychological evaluations for their informed consent, but they did not mention this option to me during my visit, so perhaps it's not an option.

Is there any way around this or should I wait? Do I need to reschedule my next appointment until after I've received my new HRT letter or should I call up to them and ask.

Lastly, I go to university in Atlanta and get free counseling there that I've not taken advantage of yet, so maybe I could convince them to write me a letter rather than wait on my current psychologist who is quite busy.

teeno731,asktransgender,"So I now have next to zero doubt that I want to have a female body, but...","I'm still not sure that I can rightfully identify as female. If Google search doesn't fail me, being dysphoric means feeling like your brain is essentially misplaced into a body of the opposite sex. I have always felt like somewhat of a feminine person, but as many point out to me (and with which I agree), I act much more like a gay man than a woman. I'm actually bi, though that's not entirely relevant, but it seems quite true. I swear like a sailor, manspread at obtuse angles and slouch consistently. I rarely use hand signals when talking as far as I notice and tend to be habitually dominant in conversations with women. My apparently womanly traits of being relatively empathetic, disliking male-specific clothing, liking children, being totally into Barbies as a kid etc. could even be attributed to the fact that I had next to no male peers in my life until around 7 years old and even then not having much until what you Americans call middle school.

Additionally, I have never had an issue with being viewed as a man, being called ""he"", a boy or by my male name (though being called a ""man"" recently has been a bit shocking). I actually take a bit of pride in being able to be seen as attractive in my current body. In fact, being called a girl, woman, a female name or ""she"" is a strange concept for me and doesn't make me fantasise that much about it. 

Yes, I understand that my body is my choice and that I don't have to act a certain way because of my body, but I don't think I'd be willing to stand the inevitable ""you're just a man in drag"" comments or other judgements of my apparent nonconformity by others. 

Also, forgive me if none of this content makes sense; its 4:30 AM and this is not usually awake time for me. I get weirdly emotional and self-loathing this late."
CorbutoZaha,asktransgender,"How do you stop seeing only the ""fire and brimstone"" path for transition?","I'm at the point right now where I can't see myself in the future as a woman. I just am having a hard time visualising it. And because of that, all I can imagine is all the terrible outcomes; I'll be fired and never work in my profession again, I'll be the horrible trope of a dude in a dress, I'll be shunned by all the people in my life, etc, etc. 

I know intellectually that not all of these must come to fruition. But I am having a hard time injecting rational thought into this emotional soup in my mind.

GrimBluGuardian,asktransgender,What keeps you going?,"I saw the recent post of another person who killed themselves. What really tears at me is the fact that even the strongest, kindest, and most educated of us can be broken down to the point of suicide. This is how rotten the world is towards trans people. 

I have 3 things keeping me going through each day that I used to think would give me an unbreakable will but with each passing day I can feel that will withering. It may never break, but the weight of the depressions is crushing nonetheless.

I got the idea to ask you guys something. What keeps you going? For me it's these. One, I have a best friend who's passed now. In my teenage years is when I was closest to ending my life. I met her online and though I never met her irl, she was the kindest person I've ever met. She made me promise never to hurt myself. I could never make her cry so I promised her.

Second, I have a rebellious ""fuck you"" attitude towards anything that tries to control me. Whenever anyone or anything pushes me I push back even harder, including life. All the bs that happens makes me wanna push on just to spite it.

And third, my husband. He's very loving and gives everything he can to make me happy, even if we can't afford it. He's got his own problems that take their toll on him so we lean on each other. And for those who may think they'll never find someone, listen to this. I met my husband on Minecraft of all places. I'm not smart, strong,  pretty, or talented in any way, and he chose me to spend the rest of his life with. You WILL find someone. 

So, what keeps you going? Maybe others who read this can take some strength from it to help them keep going."

No one loves me and clearly no one ever will cause everyone fucking hates trans women. And that's if they even see me as a woman, which is impossible, I'm going to look like a man forever no matter what I do. So I'm going to be alone forever, I've resigned myself to that. Transitioning takes too long even if I somehow got started right away (and didn't have to navigate the abuses and gatekeeping involved) and I'll just look and feel ridiculous trying makeup or women's clothing. And to top it all off I have a worthless education that's never gonna get me a job even if I graduate so I'll be stuck working at this shitty coffee shop for $8.50 an hour forever.

Aoifexb,asktransgender,Puberty is starting to catch up to me,"As far as puberty goes, I've gotten off fairly well previously.

My brow bone too I've started to notice more and it's making me extremely dysphoric.

sullixyz9,asktransgender,"Kicked out yesterday, need advice.","Short introduction, I'm 19 years old MTF, I live in the East of England (Norwich). I came out to my mother in March of this year, my father found out that I was trans about 2-3 weeks ago, through my mother - I did not approve of this. I have a prescription for hormones, given by Dr Webberley that was delivered from ClearChemist and the tracking said that it arrived on Tuesday last week and it was signed for by my family name, I was not home at the time. I believe that on arrival my mother/father threw the hormones away immediately as my mother is not supportive of my transition and I have no idea about my father's opinion - he could be transphobic.

 My father physically abused me at 14, and this was left a secret about our family until now. No one in my family has done anything to help me despite how depressed its made me, and in the past, it made me suicidal. My mother is in extreme denial about this, despite the fact that she was always there when it happened, and constantly goes to victim blaming me instead of admitting my father could be at fault for attacking me. Apparently, from talking to my mother, my sister (only other family member) would - if needed - testify that it was my fault for getting attacked. Last week, I got extremely frustrated about this, so I sent small messages to our neighbours that knew our family saying ""[My father's name] [our address] abused his 14 year old son, please avoid this man"". My father freaked out about this yesterday, threatened to call the police on me and ultimately kicked me out, I was told that he spoke to the police on the same day in secret without my mother knowing. I'm currently staying at a friends house (I can stay until Monday morning) and I can't do anything today since it is a weekend. My dad does work away from home and only comes home on the weekend so I can be allowed back into my home on Tuesday for a few days. 

What can I do?

edit: 16/10/20 my dad is not going to hold any charges against me, I've also gotten advice on how to contact the police from organisations who deal with people in similar positions as me. If I do want to report anything to the police, I should be fine. Thanks for the concern - I'm at home again."

I usually don't care about what others think of me but this for some reason terrifies me.

We have even less money now so I had to stop seeing my therapist, so at this point I'm just terrified of what my body is doing and I also need confidence.

Skyewarn72,asktransgender,I feel so screwed and I don't what to do! Dating-What to do when you actually find the person you really like?,"I've been using online dating since the middle of this year, specifically plenty of fish.  I've had numerous pervs and wierdos contact me with or without trans disclosure.  But recently decided to not disclose my status online.  Before, I did disclose my status and I only got replies from alot of hardcore chasers and those guys that dont read profiles.  That led me into taking off the disclosure.  The way I see it, is I will have a voice before they silence/judge me.  So now, I've been contacted by many guys who fall for me  after getting to know me.  The only thing is, I disclose to them Im trans and they either run or politely reject me.  So, this time, I go out on a date with a guy I've been chatting with for the last week.  We hit it off, had alot in common.  At some point during the night our eyes locked and we had that special moment and I knew we connected with each other. I broke the gaze suddenly because I knew the impending doom of rejection was around the corner.  We had a great time, hugged each other tightly.  He called me later that night and told me later on the way home that he spoke to his mother (about the situation with the hurricane and also mentioned about our date).  He wants to see me again and spoke about having me over to his apartment to spend more time together later on down the road.  Everything is happening so perfectly that I'm feeling butterflies.  My heart is already breaking knowing what I have to do.  He is so excited about us, as well as I.  Now I feel that I'm going to crush him-as well as myself.  I really want this.  Now I wish I could just crawl in a hole and shribble up.  I dont know what to do.  Is this going to be what I have to look forward to for the rest of my life.  I feel like I cursed myself because I'm living the life that I want.

So, an update.......

I tried to text him this morning and he insisted me call to tell him what was on my mind.  I told him and he was upset.  He told me that he was expecting a female with female parts.  That really upset me at that point but even after I explained why I didn't put it in my profile, he accused me of deception.  I've had many rejections, however, I really wanted this one to work out.  I'm not sure which approach is better.  I'm afraid to try anymore because Im so emotionally drained at this point and ready to give up.  IDK."

We´ve been hanging out and... well, I totally felt in love with her. I have never been so good with someone, we have slept together and I´m wordless. Of course she doesn´t want to be in the middle of anything... I do respect any decision  she will make about us... But she recently told me that she probably won´t see me again... and I´m quite desperate about it.

Elena1270,asktransgender,This is bullshit,"So instead of my endo calling me to let me know he is prescribing HRT, I get a call from the social worker telling he needs to see me again because the endo wants more questions asked. This sounds like gatekeeping to me and its BULLSHIT!! No other medical condition requires a person to jump through this many hoops to get treatment. If I had asked to get my man boobs removed or a nose job, all that would be needed is informed consent. They would tell me the risks, I would sign off on it and get it done. Hell, one life changing and body altering procedure was done to me without my consent when I was a little baby. Nobody made my parents talk to a social worker before having me circumsized. I am so pissed right now I could spit tacks!! Im about to say screw the whole thing and save the $75 dollars this additional session is going to cost me for more hormones from the overseas pharmacy. Maybe I would be better off staying DIY."

Space49,asktransgender,"Why should, or shouldn't, I take hormones or testosterone/puberty blockers?","Just wondering if someone could clear things up? I'm 15 and I've come to the conclusion that I am probably trans in some way, but I'm still mainly in the closet. I want to be able to express my more feminine side, considering that I'm hardly masculine at all, but I don't plan on gender reassignment. 

I don't like being flat chested because it makes me look like shit in a dress and it emphasizes my unfeminine face. However I feel uncomfortable with the idea that I'd have to change my body to be able to act and present myself as a female would. It's not that I don't hate my sex; I just don't want to give it the satisfaction of stopping me being me.

Backstory aside, if I came out, or if I started talking to a therapist, should I take puberty blockers? Browsing this subreddit, I get a sense that most people take some kind of hormones, blockers, etc., and that it really helps them. Yet I don't see why I should start playing with my brain chemistry so that I can change who I am, when I only really feel dysphoric at the concept that I can only be treated the way that everyone treats people with the same bits between their legs as what's between mine.

Mgrieves88,asktransgender,Parent of a gender non-conforming child,"Hey all,

Tl;dr: Yesterday marked the first time our child, she's 9, was rejected by family members for her identity. I don't know how to feel or proceed about it and I don't know how to protect her from her dad. 

Earlier this summer, our daughter told us that she felt a lot like my sister (she's a transwoman) and we allowed her to explore her identity. She decided that she wanted to change her name and we started using the correct pronouns. She felt so much happier (she has a history of depression). At first, we were so excited that she was feeling happy that we over extended ourselves and started telling everyone about her identity and how they better fucking accept it. Mostly, everything was ok until we told her father who just wouldn't accept it. He told us that he wasn't going to accept her until she explained it to him herself. 

Later that day, my child told me that she was kidding about everything and that she didn't want to stop being a boy. All the sudden the depression and anger washed back over her. 

Later that weekend her father had a mental breakdown and she texted us from her tablet saying that her dad was going to kill himself. My fiancé had to sit on the phone and reassure her that things would be ok as her dad drove back to our house. The entire time he scared the shit out of her by driving dangerously and explained that she was never going to see him again. She still has ptsd about the situation. 

Long story short, last month she decided that she wanted to explore her identity again and asked that we contact her school. We did, and they were really cool about everything, except for the bathrooms (we live in NC so hb2 keeps her from using the correct restroom), and even had a special announcement for her class to reintroduce her. 

This weekend she decided that she wanted to tell her grandma and grandpa, which we have been dreading because they are close minded southerners. They told us that they flat out wouldn't respect our wishes and that she couldn't wear the dress she planned on wearing, because it would ruin her grandpa's birthday (personally, I don't think it would, but they didn't want to tell him). I know that finding out can be difficult. Hell, I'm pretty opened minded, but when my sister came out, I didn't want to accept it at first. Still, what do I do? I'm really angry at them for feeling like she is just going through a phase and they also blamed my sister for why our daughter feels this way. 

Meanwhile, her dad started texting her again (it's almost her birthday) and so we decided to tell him. During the conversation he intimated that he would see ""d"" (her given name) later this weekend (as an aside he hasn't contacted her for a month before this and hasn't really been much of a father in terms of support financially or emotionally aside from a few text messages every few weeks) when my fiancé corrected him, he said that ""I will when he tells me"" - the same thing he said before shit hit the fan back in July. 

How do I protect her from this dude? He says his parental rights give him the ability to see her despite what her therapists have said. Come to find out today, he wants to form a support group for parents of lbgt children, because, even though he's supportive of her decision, he has questions and concerns. I feel like he wants to use this situation to gain control of her again. In the past, we've attempted to involve her in support groups, but they make her anxious. I honestly just don't know what to do. "
Fly_By_Orchestra,asktransgender,"26, mtf. I need to move out of my opinionated father's house, but can't because of chronic pain. Can I have some advice please?","I'll try to keep this as simple as possible. I've recently started transition (as in, just picked up my first round of HRT yesterday), and have become worried that as I start to show signs, my father will either want to kick me out, or just make my life a living hell. 

In short, he's a conservative, ""true"" (his words, not mine) Christian, that believes all LGBT people are sinners, what's wrong with society, etc. If he finds out about my transition, things aren't going to go well, no matter the exact outcome. Now here's the problem-

I've had chronic abdominal pain for almost seven years. It hit me just as I was midway through community college. Because of that, I had to drop out of school, and quit my job. 

No doctor can figure it out. I've been to GI specialists, a neurologist, surgeons, a pain specialist, several GP's, and even an acupuncturist. No one has answers, or a cure (and that's after antidepressants, scopes, sugar injections, and nerve block). In short, it's bad, and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. 

I should also note that I've tried a lot of alternative stuff to cure it as well such as: raw food diet, enemas, THC, crystal therapy, visualizations, meditation, etc. It didn't work. 

So I feel like there's a ticking bomb in my life. I've got to move out, and I'm just flabbergasted as to how I can pay for it. Because of the pain, I have no real job experience, or significant schooling (just an associates degree). I'm really not confident that there's a job I could handle working (oh, and it doesn't qualify me for disability either, I checked). 

The only ideas I can come up with are bad:

-Find a Sugar Daddy. Like- yeah right. I'm too old to be desirable for that I think. Not to mention the odds of finding a decent one seem... low? 

-Camming. Although it seems to be a popular way to make some extra money- I can't see it supporting me. And again, I don't think I'm attractive enough (or could be). 

-Writing Erotic Fiction. Plausible, but it doesn't seem like something people do as a sole source of income. Not to mention the fact that if I made just a few dollars too much, I'd lose my health insurance. 

Sigh. Overall, I'm just stumped. I don't need anyone to just spell it all out for me. Just whatever thoughts come to mind would be helpful. Thanks for taking the time. 

**tl;dr Having just started transition, I'm concerned that my ""true"" Christian father will either kick me out, or make life miserable for when he notices the changes. I want to move out, but have no job experience/ability to work due to so far incurable chronic abdominal pain. Just want to hear your thoughts on the matter.**

I am full-time, and passing and getting bottom surgery isn't something that will change the way the vast, vast majority of people interact with me but I have a lot of genital dysphoria and it just really sucks that it's going to be so long before I can have a normal sex life and feel like my body is the way it should be. I already tuck almost every day, although not all the time -- not usually when im at home, unless I'm wearing something really tight, and I don't use my penis a lot during sex. I never top.

Mind you I've NEVER once pressed them to use it for anything at all as I'm mostly a top anyways. If their penis was ever involved in any sexual act it was 100% of their own accord with me agreeing to the act afterwards. I ask this because it seems on here to be vastly heavy in the other direction and I completely understand why as much as a cis male can from an outsider's POV. 

I'm kinda rambling at this point but I guess what I'm curious is ladies who kept their penis and are okay with using it. I think it'd be interesting to her the logic/personal experiences that lead you to decide against SRS. NOT THAT THERE IS A SINGLE THING WRONG WITH GETTING THE SURGERY.

NikkiWarriorPrincess,asktransgender,"U.S. VETS (and anyone else, really): how have you navigated your transition inside and/or outside the VA?","I got out of the Air Force in 2012, and started to transition in 2013. So far I've received all of my medical and mental health care at the VA. The counseling staff have been very supportive and encouraging, and it was awesome to get HRT there and voice training from a speech pathologist at the VA. I've been on HRT for 30 months now and laser has done everything it will. Altogether, I look great, but I need more than that... 

All of 2015 &amp; 2016 was spent trying to get employment and housing (finally a success!). Now 2017 will be the year of Nicole. I'm 100% determined to get an orchi. I'm 100% determined to start electrolysis so I never have to shave again. I'm 100% determined to get breast auaugmentation. I'm hopeful I'll be able to get voice surgery &amp; a trach shave. And I want to start planning for a shiny new vagina in 2018. 

Having spent my entire life on my parents insurance, Tricare in the military, or VA care after, I don't know the first thing about navigating insurance and healthcare in the private sector. Any tips or resources?

If you started receiving care there after serving, what did you do when you realized gender transition would be necessary?   Have you continued receiving all your medical care there in hopeful anticipation of changes to policy? Have you moved out of the VA for transition-related needs while continuing receiving general medicine and mental health care there? Or have you moved out of the VA altogether?  Are you happy with where you are? How have your decisions enabled or inhibited your progress?"

transinit,asktransgender,GCS: future gene therapy that could turn testicles into ovaries and vice versa?,"I'm going to be talking to my therapist about MtF bottom surgery soon, and the _only_ concern I have is that I'd be discarding my testicles only to have a potential medical breakthrough happen in the next few years that could turn them into ovaries and have them moved inside my body, removing the need for estradiol pills.  Does anyone else have any similar concerns?

There was an article about how a single gene prevents ovaries turning into testes: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/07/20/one-gene-keeps-mickey-from-turning-into-minnie/ - while a Quora answer expands on it: from https://www.quora.com/What-can-gene-therapies-like-CRISPR-offer-the-transgender-community/answer/Heather-M-Rhodes :

&gt; Currently CRISPR (Gene knockout/introduction) is being approved for human testing. CRISPR is what is called a gene drive or gene “editor.” By introducing a gene known currently as CBX2 and theoretically FOXL2 and removing DMRT1, a study proved that in mice, ovaries could be converted to testes, while testes could be converted to ovaries.

&gt; FOXL2 is a gene that instructs ovarian tissue to STAY ovarian tissue and not convert to testicular tissue, whereas DMRT1 is the mirror opposite, instructing testicular tissue to remain tissue and not convert to ovarian tissue.

&gt; So in theory, by simply introducing this gene drive with the desired gene modifications, the drive would spread throughout the targeted tissue type and modify each cell, thus converting testes to ovarian tissue.

&gt; This does not change chromosomes XY to XX, but accomplishes the genetic instructions within the chromosomes to allow for perpetual modification. What this means for trans people?

&gt; Simple.

&gt; It means that instead of needing hormone replacement therapy drugs for the rest of their life, they would theoretically just relocate the gonadal tissue to a place appropriate for that tissue within the body and they would have their own hormone production congruent with their desired gender.

&gt; Also, this allows for modification of the XY chromosome to remove the SRY gene that prevents female development. Introducing this into bone marrow would in essence make creating a genetically matched vagina, uterus, and ovaries through 3d printing and lab construction. In theory, of course, this can all be done in the next 5 years if the scientific community targets this field for a major study. Problem is, funding for studies into transgender health and science is extremely difficult to procure, and thus are not typically considered important."

Yet I still want to cry every single day, I still find myself hating my body and face. I enter into relationships with guys that I know will hurt me, not just emotionally. I engage in risky behaviour such as ""trapping"" which I know is wrong.  
  
  
  
I honestly don't know what to do, the only reason I don't kill myself is because I think to myself ""what a waste"" then continue being a sad and mean bitch.

TinaThrowaway00,asktransgender,My Trans Confusion (V Long) (NSFW),"!!WARNING!!
This post is very long.
I'm typing this on my tiny phone keyboard so please forgive any errors. :P
I'm also quite tired and this is not my first attempt at writing this, so keep that in mind as well.

Before I begin, I know this subreddit is transgender and thus a bit bias toward this topic, but I please can you read my story as neutral as you can. Likewise, I'm trying to be as neutral in my writing as possible, not too girly, not too manly. Anyway enjoy. :)

I am currently a 16yr old male living in Australia. But I'll talk more about the present later. Lets start were it all began, the first memory. I was about 4-5 and I remember watching some award ceremony on the TV. Later, when I was in my bed I was imagining this machine that I could magically select a body from a wide range, large &amp; short, male &amp; female. I fondly recall this one white female who was wearing a quite provocative and revealing red dress (I obviously was inspired from the TV). Being curious, I picked her and started imagining what it would be like to be her. These thoughts filled my mind for the next few days and my dreams for a handful of weeks. Her skin, her dress all interested me. Nothing sexual. Out of all the choices why did I choose the female? Maybe I was just curious?

The next memory is from relatively the same period. I was getting ready for bed, changing into my pyjamas. I peaked my head around the corner. No one was there. For some reason I decided to put two legs through one hole, just like a dress. I felt rebellious, happy. Was I happy because I was rebelling? Or was it from deeper issues?

I can't recall anything out of the ordinary until a few years later, when I was 6-7 (or maybe even earlier). I was over at my nan's place from some special gathering, and sat in a room with my older brother and younger cousin. The meal was taking forever to be ready so we decided to entertain ourselves. Closing the door, we created what was known later to be 'The Bum Game'. This was purely out of curiosity, because ""hey she's a girl and we're both boys how are we so different?"" So we stood infront of the others and took all our clothes off (god looking back it sounds bad). It was sort of a dare game. The sexual differences weren't obvious as the room was nearly pitch black. We knew we were doing something naughty, but our innocence blinded us. We continued this practice a few more times until we actually noticed what we were doing. So, how does this relate to my gender? Well, for some time after it, every now and then I would dream of stealing her clothes when she was all skin and put them on. Or, I would imagine her forcing me to put it on (keep in mind, I was still super innocent).

My memory trail about this issue becomes dark for some years, until I started puberty ~12. This is when it really started. Like I said, I don't know if this was the true start and I also likely mixed the order of one or two things. But just for this next little bit. At my primary school, there was this netball skirt sitting ontop of the shelves where my locker sat. Night after night I fantasized about taking it home and wearing it. Everytime I came close to taking it I got cold feet. One day after a few weeks of my imagination flying, it was gone.

When I started to feel sexual pleasure I started to make my own feminine clothes.  I put two legs through one leg hole to make a skirt, got a top and put legs through the sleves to make bike shorts (like girls wore under school dresses), put legs through sleeves of my thermal to make leggings, and countless others 'creative' clothes. I did all this under a blanket of darkness, in my room all by myself.

Around the same time, I started to look at porn pictures. Mainly upskirt photos. I put on my creative clothes, trying to look and feel like the ones they had. I even learnt how to tuck (but as I did this throughout puberty, my manhood has a slight curve). I honestly don't know why it was mainly upskirt, maybe I didn't want to see their sexual parts, just feel like them..?

Anyway, that continued until I turned 13. My cousin came over for a sleepover. Late into the night when everyone was asleep I crept out of my room into the lounge (as she was sleeping on the couch-bed). I opened a plastic bad and took a pair of panties on the top. I went back to my room, as excited as ever. No longer did I have to make my own clothes I could wear some real ones. I slid them up my legs and tucked my masculinity through my legs. Instantly I fell in love with the fabric. When I was content with them I decided to go back for more. This time I picked out a skirt and put it on. It felt so light it, it felt so elegant, it felt so beautiful. I returned the items and hopped into my bed feeling content with my voyage. I knew I was different now. I started researching and stumbled upon transgender. I wasn't a girl, was I? I knew that if i truely was now was the right time to open up, right before puberty hit. But I didn't. Didn't tell my family nor my friends. It was just a phase, right?

The method of 'borrowing' from guests continued with my brothers girlfriends and even my cousin one other time. I tried dresses, panties, bras, pantyhose, leggings and more. Until I just couldn't stop. I resorted to using my mothers (it's bad and I'm sorry). Not anything she wore often, but some deep in her underwear draw I found. Of course I didn't keep it, just put it right back, no harm.

My brothers latest girlfriend moved out (she had family issues) when he broke up with her, but I kept a pair of sport leggings (I love leggings) as I washed them after a happy ending. Turns out I'm not very good at washing nor drying, and the wet fabric started to smell. One night, when I opened my wardrobe smell was gone. I searched for where I stashed it, but nothing was there my mum had found them. I went through a spiral of emotions; anger, fear and relief. No word was ever said by my mum (I partially thank her for that).

That was about 1 and 1/2 years ago. Since, I stashed some pantyhose (which I also love) and a bra of my mum's in my wardrobe. Somehow again she found them. I went through the same spiral of emotions; anger, fear and relief. But yet again no words exchanged. Currently I have some pantyhose and a pair of leggings stashed in a different spot. I'm sure she knows I have something and it's a matter of time until she finds them, but I just love them so much I can't give them up! However, the wearing of these are changing slowly. From just sexual acts to feeling like I need to wear them 24/7.

As for porn well, roughly around 14 I integrated into normal porn videos, but I didn't like them. The girl turned me on but the male interaction completly ruined it. I changed to lesbian porn for a while, specifically POV and strapon. However recently, I've found sissy hypno and shemale porn. It has turned me on like never before, to be somewhat treated like a woman. Now get this straight, I'm 100% not gay (male &amp; male), it turns me completely off. But if I assume the role of a female, suddenly I am turned on. One dream I've been having recently is my crush (female) strapping me naked onto a bed and her forcing me to wear girl clothes while she strapon penetrates me in the behind. This dream is slowly starting to turn into a sissy's, sucking meat and being penetrated.

I've been so fixated on penetration that I try to refrain from stroking, trying to use a handle shaped like a dildo and some cooking oil to penetrate myself. Also before you go off at my lack of toys/clothes, I'm only 16 (illegal to drive on my own and to enter a sex shop here) and very rarely go outside as I'm very shy and am in love with my PC (but that's another story). I've also started shaving my pubic area regularly to not disturb my feminine image.

Before you go off and say ""But you only want to wear girls clothes, you're just a crossdresser."" Sure it may seem like that from a sexual point of view, and I even think I was that at the very beginning. Especially through the 'sissy' fetish. Sure, maybe I just like the fetish but maybe it's just easier for me to accept that it's just a fetish not a gender issue. Also recently after watching the sissy porn, my eyes have begun to open and notice the feminine actions and desire within. I want that cute necklace, that feminine posture, the female voice.

My interests? They are mainly linked to men; cars, computers and gaming. What about my personality? Well I'm extremely shy and closed to everyone. My appearance is a thin, small chest, ~5'8"" white male. I think I'm bisexual (only if I'm a female with men), but romantically I guess females as I always feel nervous around them, but I'm sure that could changs. It may also be worth mentioning that I have never had a girlfriend, never felt like I wanted one until recently. Maybe just because I want to fit in or just want some more company. I think of my personality as rather girly, defantly not very masculine.

Now for the big questions that made me question myself even more.
What if I woke up as a girl?
Well, I'd feel very happy to say the least, I'd be more feminine and do more feminine activities as I could finally fit in.
Or, what made me wake up alot, Why do I want to be male?
To fit in, it's just easier. My hobbies and romantic preferences.
Why do I want to be female?
So I feel like I can be myself. I feel like the more I become feminine the more I truely open up and become happy. I can't explain it very well but it just feels right. Maybe all these years the reason I've been so shy and hidden is because I'm not myself.

I feel the only manly part I like about myself is my beard (I dont know why), everything else like muscles (even though I have none) and my actions I'm not truely liking, I feel like I have to do it to fit in.

Fitting in is a big deal for me. I struggled the first few years of high school (middle school I think in US) making friends as I was so shy, and finally made some. But not some I can truely open up to. Plus I dont want to lose them as my school is tiny and they are the only group I feel like a slightly fit in. So if I was trans, could I make the transition? Not now. I'm too scared of losing my friends and truely arent ready. Maybe if I was wait until uni (but I'd be shy and climb up mountaints trying to make friends again, ending up in the same place).

What about therapy? I'm not ready for person to person therapy at the moment, but I've thought about online sessions recently.

I'm sorry for such a long winded post, my minds been racing and I feel like it is all over the place while writing this. I've also probably left 101 things out as I've rushed the end to finally get some sleep. But I really feel like I needed to let this out. I know no one is going to read this and it's only going to get burried, but thank you reddit for pretending to listen. If you did come this far I truely thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'd love if someone could comment and help me a little but I'm just gonna get burried. I also feel like this was slightly biased towards my male side, so it may even be a little inaccurate. :(

So am I trans?

Thanks anyway,
Tina (trying not to dox myself, so my female persona)

Thank you everyone for the replies, I have tried to answer all of them. All of you have started to convince me that I am trans ^Thanks!! . I've even just realised my thoughts have gone from am I trans? To how do I tell my parents, ect.

Wolfadox,asktransgender,How did y'all overcome your fears in public?,"It's my kryptonite you can say whenever I want to just walk out dressed up and fully in makeup even though i'm in pre mode /: I want to just go anywhere and not have a second worrying about someone looking at me weirdly, creeped out, or worse wanting to cause harm to me. So really my question is how did y'all overcome it and not have it on your mind on a daily basis when all you want to do is just be yourself?"
samecontent,asktransgender,Competition judo after 1 year of HRT... ?,"Just remembered Judo tourneys don't allow for rash guards. Honestly, if I want to compete tomorrow, I will cause quite a ruckus. Here are the ways it could go...

I wear a bra. Is that a rash guard? Is that just not going to be allowed depending on where I am categorized? If I don't wear a bra, it's going to be suuuuuper awkward.
Will I compete in Women's or Men's? I would love to compete in Women's, would I be allowed to do so? Probably not. But if I try to do a demonstration entry, I basically have to pay tourney fees AND membership fees /just/ to get in. And then likely get kicked out, or be reclassified in some awkward fashion in a room fool of potentially hostile martial artists.

It's also Grand Rapids, and not sure what just blanket response I will get. How trans friendly is the city? I honestly don't have a clue.

Lastly, I know that my testosterone levels are very well likely down to IOC levels for competing as female. But even as a state-sanctioned tourney, and I know the level of sophistication of our state-level Judo (pretty much non-existent,) I do not think they will care or have the know how to recognize the significance of those kinds of standards set by the Olympic committee for trans entrants.

I have to say, I feel kind of fucked all around, and I am not sure how ready I am to do tournaments yet, especially with boobs."
Syuas,asktransgender,Low dose to Normal Questions,"So, basically I've been on .5 estradiol twice and 50 Spiro once daily regiment for about a month. My doctor said after one month we would up the dosage to something more normal. Since starting my depression and discomfort over my current gender has totally faded. I felt so well I tried to stop for a few days thinking I was past it only to find myself feeling like shit once again. So now I'm at a crossroad where I CAN up my dosage but I'm worried about the effects.

Current effects are just I feel well, I can get a bit emotional sometimes but that's easily managed, chest feels tingly sometimes and I think my nipples are firmer than usual. My Question is if I up the dosage how aggressive will the changes get or will they still be manageable. I don't want to socially transition for at least a year from now lol if possible or longer.

Also wearing a sports bra, or compression outfit and passing it off as a back brace is manageable to hide small breast growth if it gets to that point. Having huge boobs that cannot be hidden is well not -_-

I'm black if that affects anything and my hair is pretty damn short."

SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,"I'm 25 years old, it's now been exactly about two months since I started HRT","I woke up today and went into my ""female-trained"" voice like no problem, except there was a problem. My voice sounded strained and was cracking like I shouldn't talk like that. It confused and worried me, I then scolded the dog after she broke my headphones and realized.. wait a minute, I didn't drop into my male voice? This.. caused excitement and fear.

To elaborate, I had to work on my voice a different way from the traditional due to the fact when I was younger I suffered an injury that messed up my larynx and made it hard to talk as a girl, or a guy for that matter. Several years later using hard work and the technique I practiced I could present myself as a woman.

Now.. I'm 25 years old, my male puberty was very late and possibly still going up when I was using blockers..

Talked to a close friend and he's like.. ""You still sound like you ____, but I guess you sound I dunno smoother? Sounds like a woman would to me.""

So now I'm trying to adapt from applying 100% effort to sound female.. to.. well, 0%.

Has anything like this ever happened..? Could it be related to my damaged/scarred larynx?

Like.. it's exciting but also terrifying."

rising-above-myself,asktransgender,How to handle being outed?,"FML!!  I was outed by my mother in law on purpose.   People were asking her why I was depressed lately and told her that they were concerned for me. So, she outed me as transgender.  FML!!

I have/had a stable career that was definitely not trans friendly, so with everything in my life I am very cautious and slow going with my transition.  Only a few people knew, I wanted to drip feed it as to get everyone who really matters used to they idea.  I find I make crushing mistakes when I rush things.  Now, it's out there. 

I don't even know what to ask, if you were outed before you were ready how did you handle it?   I'm already an introvert (INTJ and a enneagram 6), so I just want to bury myself away.  FML..  

Once I get happy with the idea of transition and set things up I get blown outta the water.  I guess it's just life.  I'm a big girl, I've had worse things in my life.  "
DEUSONE,asktransgender,Second Question Here (on what I should do with myself.),"Hi. I need to vent for a sec.

-I am in constant physical, emotional, and mental pain each day without HRT

-All my friends would hate me if I came out to them, but quite honestly I hate everyone around me for one reason or another already.

-Not being able to focus, take care of myself, or do much of anything besides sometimes win at video games because I'm always thinking about how nice it would be to be a girl

-Can't even be near a girl, or anyone for that matter, without him/her being disgusted by me because I have constant, untreated, incredibly severe, allergies 100 percent of the time. So I am basically a walking train wreck.

-Not being born a heteronormative cis female makes me quite upset by itself, and all the girls at my school complain about how hard it is to be a girl ALL THE TIME. I just want to ask them for a switch, or cuss them out. The second of which I do to everyone who comes near me.

- My mom denies my trans status to this very minute and thinks I'm ""misguided"" and ""too immature"". Thank you, I can think better than you anyway.

-Acceptance and transition seems further from my grasp each passing day.

-My teachers and parents don't think I'm trying at school because I hate myself too much to think straight, let alone gay.

That's my shit life in a nutshell. I need ways to cope because I'm falling behind in classes(and I go to a boarding school, so no parental comfort, but home is pretty much the same). I have no idea how to do so and it's really hurting me socially and academically. I want to tell the school-residential GP about my being trans, but then he would tell my parents and they would become more angry than usual. In addition, I don't even know if he can prescribe ant-androgens or estrogen. There is a school psychiatrist as well, but I can't really trust him or the GP because they're tight with school staff. I'm having a hard time moving, let alone thinking about this. I have an off-site psychologist and my dad who are on my side. I would still need to convince mom and whomever else needs convincing. Also, I don't even know the way to go about GETTING HRT even though I have read a ton of internet articles on them. I really am just paralyzed by stress right now and need some solid advice on how to handle my life.

P.S. I am a minor.
TL;DR-I hate my life and want HRT with no feasible way to obtain it-no coping mechanisms- am beginning to decline in classes because of this, and even though my family knows I am overwhelmed by this and have the PFLAG stats (untreatment/suicide stats ESPECIALLY) they refuse to treat me. I am so done with life."
PossibleNicki,asktransgender,How do I know if I have gender dysphoria (MTF)?,The reason I'm asking this is because I'm going to be starting HRT soon (MTF) and I'm having doubts.
I_hate_naming_things,asktransgender,Is there an updated list of trans friendly doctors for all areas?,"If there isn't, I would gladly make one because I remember when I was looking for a place to get HRT, it took me awhile to find since wasn't much information out for my area. It would also be nice to have a list of general doctors that are trans friendly for other reason from HRT. Maybe even a black list for the not so trans friendly doctors. 

Does this sound like a good idea to yall? If it does, then hit me up with some names and places, and I will put it in a google spreadsheet, then share to everyone.

Edit: I was thinking this would be a worldwide type of document. No country should be left behind. I'll try organize it to where it's easy to find your area. 

Also, might be nice to list therapists to."

throwaway34598375,asktransgender,Highly likely I'm somewhere on the spectrum but not sure where...,"I've posted a few times and I suppose it's just because for the past month and a half I've begun to question both my gender identity and expression. I've already spoken to my doctor about what I've been feeling as of late so hoping that helps.

I first thought I might be genderfluid because at times I felt very masculine and sometimes a little feminine. This lead me to putting less pressure on myself to present as female. It felt like such a massive weight off my shoulders. I used to do a lot of things to try and feel like a confident woman. Do my hair, my makeup, do my nails etc. I just got so tired and looking back on it, it felt a little fake and exhausted me. This lead me to slowly coming to the realisation that maybe I didn't want to present as female at all anymore when I realised I had a choice. 

I've always researched things for trans men, such as hormones, surgeries, transitions, STPs and things like that. I realise that I watch and follow a lot of trans men on social media. During questioning my gender identity, I realise that I can relate to them and I sort of envy them for living their lives authentically. 

In an analogy, all of this feels as if I had a shovel on my back the whole time and it hit me in the face full force. I started to look back on moments that I didn't know could be classed as dysphoria. They range from complaining I looked like a woman (I'm AFAB) repeatedly, feeling like my chest was huge and in the way and wanting it to go away, feeling as if people weren't referring to me when using female pronouns or anything gender specific (lady, woman), getting angry or uncomfortable when treated as a woman.

Around a few weeks ago I started to wonder if potentially I'm a transgendered guy without terrible body dysphoria. So ever since then despite often being down on myself, I realise that I am actually not as unattractive as I thought..for a cis woman. Which I no longer can comfortable say I am. 

It's really hard to not question how I'm feeling on a daily basis. I find myself going between feeling that I am a guy (very much so today) and feeling like I want to be a guy (which makes me feel happy).  I'm not quite sure if that's essentially the same thing. I find in those moments where I see myself as and feel that I am a guy, I feel at peace and content. Like I'm just being myself? It's as if I've not got any issues with my gender at all.

Sometimes it gets me down knowing that how I feel on the inside isn't reflected remotely on the outside, although I did purchase a binder. This was quite possibly one of the best things I have ever done and I'm annoyed I didn't do it sooner. At first, it looked weird but then I felt this overwhelming sense of relief and teared up a little. I've worn it every day since and it feels so natural to me.

My question would be, if I still have thoughts of 'wanting to be a guy', could that suggest genderfluidity? I'm trying to take this process really slowly, but I know I want to at the very least experiment in my gender expression. I've always been somewhat of a tomboy so none of that really feels out of comfort zone. 

I do think about hormones and surgery but worry that somehow I can't really be a trans guy if I'm not jumping at the chance of either. Although I am considering that hormones may be a thing for me in the future as I don't see me passing without them. Any advice would be great!"
Toosmallscreen,asktransgender,My 14 yo Sister told me today she is transgender. How do I make sure she is safe and make it as easy as possible to come out? What are your stories of transitioning at a young age?,"Hello, I am a 21yo female and my 14yo sister told me today that she identifies as a male. Sorry if I use inappropriate pronouns for the moment, she hasn't asked me to say he yet and it's still a little bit of a shock. 
I love her to bits and we had a really nice conversation which felt pretty casual and comfortable. I want her to be safe and happy more than anything my only concern is she is so young! She has felt this way for over 5 months and in general has never been a girly girl (not saying that means anything, idk its all new for me).

Our parents are lovely people but I doubt they will take her seriously. I said maybe wait until she is 16 before she tells mum and dad because they might not take her seriously and it might just make it more difficult for her but she said that she hates it, everytime she is called  a girl. How do I support her?  She is so brave. She cut her hair short, wears a septum piercing and told me today she ordered something to bind her breasts to her friend's house. I would never have the courage to do these things, to be different when I was her age. 
I just need some people to tell me things are going to be ok for her. I know the statistics are scary for trans people when it comes to bullying, depression, suicide.

I don't care whether I have a brother or a sister, I just want them to be happy.

So... what I'm asking for is advice. And happy stories before I go to bed. What was it like for you? When did you know? How did your families react?

ps, I will never use inappropriate pronouns from this moment on. So long to the she :)"

ToransuShojo,asktransgender,I'm coming out to my class at school tomorrow and need help,"I'm super nervous about this, but it needs to be done. It'll be painfully apparent that I'm transgender in about three months time, as I have come up with a plan to go from male-unisex-female. How should I go about this without being so scared? I promised I would do it no matter what, I just need some help with the anxiety.

EDIT: I did it! The reactions were extremely positive, so I can keep going without having to hide it. Thank you all for your help!"
Fade_in_Time,asktransgender,Can I ask some questions?,"Hello. I'm very new here (only really came by to ask some questions). I'm 20, in college, and have started seeing a psychiatrist to begin my transition (MtF). The biggest problem and fear that I have is that I have no idea about anything feminine. I've always been antisocial, and only have a small group of friends. As amazing as they are, they are all male. My mom left when I was young, I have no siblings, let alone a sister. I simply have no experience with girls in any way, which makes this mountain of a task seem insurmountable. As embarrassing as this is to ask, where should I start?"
ctmxwoop,asktransgender,"I'm concerned it's just a fetish, again, and considering giving up; Has anyone else experienced anything like this?","First off, I'm sorry this 'question' is really just a thinly veiled request for some commentary on my problems, but over the past few years I've made several posts here (all under different throw-away accounts) and /r/asktransgender has always been a supportive place to look for advice.

A little bit of background, I'm 25 years old, MtF (I think), I've been seeing a psychologist for about 5 months now, and I've been questioning for at least 7 years, possibly as many as 15.

I went into my first psych visit with a lot of doubt, I think everything I said ended with either the words ""maybe"" or ""I think"", so we've been working on solidifying what I actually think and feel so that we can try and deal with it.

Recently my psych suggested that I experiment - in whatever way I felt comfortable - with my gender expression, something I tried on my own around 4 or 5 years ago and still sort of continue to this day.

In the past I grew my hair out, grew longer nails, shaved my entire body; I continue to have long hair and nails, although I'm no longer in a position where I can comfortably hide shaving my entire body and I'm too self conscious about it to just 'do it and screw anyone who cares'.

This time however I went shopping, I bought a few pieces of women's clothing, things that I think I would wear if I had a magical wand of body changing.

When I got home on Thursday night I tried everything on, and well, I've never experienced anything that has made me hate my body quite like looking in a mirror absolutely ruining these cute clothes before, and that was kind of heart breaking to be honest.

I only had an hour or so to have fun before my family came home and I had to hide everything so I decided on wearing a cute dress I'd bought, and as soon as I stopped looking in the mirror something really strange happened, I had this really profound sense of 'this feels good', and having to change back into my male clothes was almost heartbreaking.

On Friday I had a whole day alone, so I could do whatever I wanted, and I woke up prickling with excitement waiting for everyone to leave just so I could put that dress back on.

This is where everything starts to go downhill, I get dressed and potter about the house like I normally would, happy as anyone could expect, I sat at my desk and tried to get some work done and as time passed it became extremely evident that I had absolutely no idea how to wear a dress properly (Oh well, who cares) but also I was slowly overcome by this weird 'sexiness'.

Looking in the mirror I hated how I looked, but sitting at my desk, looking down at myself, with the fabric against my body, I felt attractive, sexy, and that's never something I felt before. I say I was 'overcome' by that feeling, and that's really the only way I can explain it. I got really aroused by it, which happened last time as well, 4-5 years ago.. and I feel disgusted with myself because of that.

I lasted all of 3 hours before I disgraced myself, changed back to normal clothes, and started drinking, at 11 in the morning. That was yesterday, it's 6 am Saturday morning now and I've been sitting here since 4 trying to write this because I can't sleep.

I feel like such a fraud, like I've been kidding myself the whole time, and all I feel like doing is giving up, forgetting that any of this happened, and repressing the whole idea of being trans again. Probably only for another 4 years like last time though.

I'm sorry if the end of this is rambling and incoherent, I 'wrote' the first half in my head before I started typing, and the rest is just sort of vomiting thoughts at my keyboard."

catfusion,asktransgender,Transition &amp; changing MBTI?,"So this isn't supposed to happen, but it did.

Pre-transition, I tested consistently as one MBTI type. Now I test consistently as another. Now granted, I only class differently on one axis out of the four, but I've gone from introverted to extroverted (although again, from a 'fairly balanced introvert' to 'the most introverted of the extroverts'.) 

Anyways, although I have my own ideas about why or how this could occur, I'm just curious if this happened to anyone else?

So yeah, if you knew your MBTI type pre-transition, and have taken or are willing to take the test again, did your results change any? 

(You don't have to put any stock in the relevance of the MBTI stuff to play.)"

reallyconfusedone,asktransgender,Transgender or Crossdresser? Please help!,"Hi guys and gals,

ever since my puberty I remember questioning my gender and sexuality. I do think that I know my sexuality but for the gender question I'm totally clueless and would appreciate some help, if anybody more experienced can chime in? 

-Everything started in puberty. I would go to the bathroom and try on menstrual pads even going as far to put them on secretly and then going out while nobody knows, mind you I really had no clue at that age what they are used for. All I knew was that they are strictly used by women for some women ""things""

-Later on when I still knew very little about sex I remember really admiring lady bits and as a result my most satisfying sexual activity was pleasuring women orally even more so than penetration. I just love to give pleasure even up to this date.

-Ever since I can remember my most satisfying sexual fantasy was imagining myself with a man or woman but always as a woman.  I had my fair share of fantasies where I'm man and act as penetrator but needless to say they are not the most thrilling that's for sure. I've been wondering if it means I'm autogynephilic? Or even if that theory is even valid?

-I remember at school when I was dismissedd during class   for restroom break I would oftentimes go straight for ladies room even sitting down in a cubicle. I would love to tell you why I did that, but I can't say for sure. All I know is that felt strangely good.

-Last few years I kinda spend in denial, trying to focus on other things and it worked but recently this thing came back to haunt me. I have my theory why is that, but that's probably not important.

-I do crossdress and use it to masturbate and it brings me pleasure however moment I'm done and I did crossdress I feel like some kinda freak and I don't like it. Anybody know why?

-I do love to learn about cooking,fashion,celebrities, makeup. I know these things are obvious stereotype and applying it universally is bs but I consider it as a hint.

-I play professional cuddling league even for girls it's hard to match my levels.

Things looks easy so far? Not really. These don't fit.

-I used to play ice hockey professionally and few years back switched to thai boxing which I really love and if it wouldn't be for irreversible head injuries I may eventually pursue professional career. I love martial arts and I also like weight lifting.

-I do like to spend time with my GF and being in bed with her. I can be very dominant and enjoy it but oftentimes I would love to be very submissive as well. 

-My personality is kinda fierce. Majority of the time I'm calm but if I see some injustice be it to me, my friends or anybody else I can go really furious.

-For people who knows me often reffer to me as a ""silent alpha type"". That's doesn't sound girly at all, but then again so is my sister considered to be alpha in her circle..

-When I did some quite extensive online test 70 questions or more it has said I'm androgynnous. I know silly.
Do you think I'm just crossdresser or trans? Moreover I would love to know if somebody has experience with secretly starting hrt without somebody knowing so I can try and see if it's for me? Maybe like going to different country live there for 6 months, cut family and friends to just online contact and see if it's for me? Bu then again I have a gf so I really don't know how would I explain 6 months somewhere else.

Furthermore what kinda calms me is possibility of detransitioning. Anybody here started hrt MTF and didn't like the changes so went back?

thank You all for taking your time and helping me out :)

Fawnsilk_Gonfalon,asktransgender,Underwear recommendations for a trans woman who hates panties?,"It's getting to the point that I need to buy new underwear. I've always been really particular -- all I've ever liked wearing is (mens) trunks (i.e. boyshorts with a pouch and without the flap), except for the odd situation in which I'll wear some f----me underwear. The pee flap always bothered me (for some reason a certain part wanted to escape through it, maybe to freedom?), and women's panties (or thongs or boyshorts) don't provide the support I like (I'm pre-op, obviously). Gaffs are great, but the synthetic material bothers me after a while, and I feel I don't always need to tuck.

So my trunks are wearing out and/or giving me wedgies as my proportions change, and besides many of them are too high cut to work well with the rise in women's clothing. I thought about trying men's thongs, but unsurprisingly there is something about the cut that looks masculine to me.

Anyone have any recommendations on where to look or even some possible brands to check out? For quality I'm looking for something a little better than VS. I'm really open to anything that's breathable, relatively low-rise, and offers some support for my nonstandard lady bits."
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,I feel so guilty about having any sexual interest and I don't know how to feel or if it's okay to feel anywhich way.(NSFW) [NSFW],"Okay, so I'm gonna start Counseling/Therapy in the coming weeks, but right now something is really really bugging me.

I'm 99.9% sure I'm trans, so that's not my concern. My concern is that, Even though I  like to think I'm Asexual, I do have an interest in sex, but I'm still physically a guy. I want to have sex with women as a man. But, I also want to be a woman.

I mean, I want to be a woman way more than I want to have sex as a man. But I can't help but feel bad. I feel disgusting. I hate myself and being a guy yet when it comes to cute girls I instantly am okay with being a guy and am faced with the typical Teen guy urge of wanting to bang.


I'm so conflicted. I'm trans and I'm gonna transition at some point. I'm not allowed to want to still be a guy and to be interested in girls AS A GUY! Why do I feel this way? 

I've never had a super high sex drive, but part of me just wants to ""jerk my ding-dong"" or try to get a girlfriend. I thought I hated my penis, or maybe I just thought I did?

I know that these feelings of sexual attraction are normal in Teenage boys. But I thought I was actually a teenage girl who was physically male. 

I want to like girls, I don't want to feel this disgust. I don't want to fight the natural, biological feelings I have. 

I feel like I've mentally trapped myself. I don't know how to feel."
